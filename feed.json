    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is standing trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection got underway Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as photos and documentation, and an estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand. Judge David Foley said once jury selection is complete, the trial would take up to a week and a half.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not explained how he plans to defend his client and has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Foley asked potential jurors Tuesday whether they could fairly consider a case involving someone of Muslim descent or with strong religious beliefs. All indicated they could.",
      "But finding jurors who have not already formed an opinion was proving harder.",
      "Nearly all of the 27 men and women being screened Tuesday said they knew about what happened to Rushdie, either from news reports or acquaintances, and several said they had formed opinions that are unlikely to change based on what they hear at trial",
      "Matar's attorney sought unsuccessfully to move the trial out of Chautauqua County last year, citing pretrial publicity and potential prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent among the small rural county's mostly white residents.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for prejudice nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

      "In late December, Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and sought unspecified damages. Baldoni sued last month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A former friend who alleges rapper A$AP Rocky fired a gun at him in 2021 testified Monday that no one involved in the incident gave him any indication the firearm might have been fake \u2014 as the defense contends \u2014 until the day this trial started.",
      "The testimony from the trial\u2019s key witness, who goes by A$AP Relli, came at the end of a long, frustrating slog on the stand in a Los Angeles courtroom that drove him to shout, \u201cYou're annoying, bro!\u201d and much more at the lead defense attorney.",
      "In its re-direct questioning on Monday, the prosecution pushed back against the idea that for security Rocky carried a starter pistol that only shot blanks.",
      "Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec showed Relli texts from after the incident in which he told Rocky \u201cU try killing me\u201d and that Rocky had tried to take him from his daughter.",
      "\u201cAt any point did he respond to your text messages to tell you it was a fake gun?\u201d The prosecutor asked Relli, who testified his knuckles were grazed in the incident.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he responded. He said the same of the two mutual friends who had been there.",
      "The testimony was the first time the jury heard how late the prop gun defense was revealed, despite more than three years passing and several days of testimony at a preliminary hearing in 2023.",
      "Rihanna, the superstar singer who is Rocky\u2019s longtime partner and the mother of his two toddler sons, was not in the courtroom after being in the audience to support him for the trial\u2019s previous three days.",
      "Rocky has pleaded not guilty to two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, charges that with a conviction carry a maximum penalty of 24 years in prison.",
      "A day earlier, the hip-hop star was up a Grammy Award for the third time at a ceremony just two miles away, but lost to one of the night\u2019s big winners, Kendrick Lamar.",
      "Relli who first took the stand on Wednesday, had been often evasive and just as often angry under cross-examination from Rocky's lawyer.",
      "That came to a head Monday as the defense got a chance to ask its last set of questions before he was excused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on trial. I\u2019ve been here for five days, dealing with this man,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking stupid for five days.\u201d",
      "He ignored the judge\u2019s warnings not to make such statements.",

      "Last week, Relli had angrily declared that recordings of phone calls the defense played for him about getting money from Rocky were faked. Defense lawyers contend the only reason Relli went to police about the incident was so he could extract money from Rocky in the civil case he has also filed.",
      "On Monday, the man who recorded those calls, Wally Sajimi, took the stand as an out-of-order witness for the defense, and the jurors heard the recordings themselves.",
      "In one of them, a voice resembling Relli's says he'll stop participating in the criminal case as soon as he gets paid.",
      "\u201cOnce I walk away, when I get my cash, the case will get way weaker,\" says the recording that Sajimi testified he made in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for the DA to find me. Because I\u2019m going to be on another island.\u201d",
      "Sajimi testified that he builds websites for artists and brands, and has worked with both Rocky and Relli, but said he is much closer to Rocky, who he considers a friend."

      "Punxsutawney Phil\u2019s team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck\u2019s weather verdict as the sun rises",
      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

    "story": [
      "Women folk singers are preserving one of Morocco's most cherished culturual traditions, a genre of folk singing known as aita",
      "SIDI YAHYA ZAER, Morocco -- Mbarka Moullablad\u2019s family frowned when she first told them she planned to make a living as a cheikha, singing about love, pain, and societal change to the melodies of her ancestors under the stage name \u201cThouria.\u201d",
      "Women like her are the stewards of one of Morocco\u2019s most cherished oral traditions: a form of folk singing known as aita, which means a \u201ccry\u201d or \u201clament\u201d in Arabic. From smoky bars and cabarets in Morocco\u2019s largest cities to the gatherings in the country\u2019s rural regions, they croon at weddings, festivals and private events and pub nights, hypnotizing audiences both humble and wealthy.",
      "But despite aita's position in Moroccan culture, the genre\u2019s popularity does not always translate into acceptance for those who perform it. Cheikha are often stigmatized, eroticized, and pushed to society\u2019s margins. That was once a fear for Moullablad, but she says her community in Sidi Yahya Zaer, a farming town on Morocco\u2019s Atlantic plains, has mostly accepted her.",
      "\u201cMy family did not agree at first and I used to suffer from society\u2019s judgment, but now everything is good,\u201d Moullablad said on the sidelines of a recent performance south of Morocco\u2019s capital, Rabat. \u201cI do it in order to earn money for my children.\u201d",
      "A form of sung poetry, aita has long explored themes of societal triumphs, ironies, and unspoken struggles, including those related to relationships and economic hardship. Cheikha don heavy stage makeup, silk caftans, and golden takchita belts as they sing about their community's agonies and triumphs. They sway their hips to amplify emotion, dancing seductively or cheerfully depending on the context.",
      "When Moullablad performs, men and women lean in as her voice softens, captivated as she climbs octaves into a full-throated howl. The beads wrapped around her sister Fatiha\u2019s belly shake as she dances. The band leader, another singer, backs her with his own poetry while a drummer keeps the beat, a guitarist strums, and a violinist drags his bow in sync.",
      "Those who come to hear them sing say cheikha can serve as a community's truth-tellers, singing about often unspoken dynamics related to marriage, agriculture or, historically, colonial resistance. Moullablad sings in Moroccan Arabic, embodying traditions specific to her community. But cheikha across the North African Kingdom also perform in the indigenous Amazigh language, adapting the music and lyrics to reflect their region.",
      "The art form has inspired contemporary acts like the electro-infused \u201cAita, Mon Amour\u201d and Kabareh Cheikhats, a troupe of male actors who pay homage, dress and sing in the tune of Morocco's most celebrated 20th century women folk singers. It is also the subject of Morocco\u2019s submission for this year\u2019s Academy Awards, \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d which follows a single mother who leaves her town in the Atlas Mountains to pursue her dream of singing in bars, cabarets, and hotels in Casablanca.",
      "\u201cI was always amazed by their strength and the power that they have toward people when they open their mouths. Whether they are modern or conservative people, they all stand up and get into a kind of trance like gospel,\u201d Nabil Ayouch, the film\u2019s director, said in an interview when the film premiered at the Marrakech Film Festival last year.",
      "Morocco\u2019s music scene is increasingly embracing Middle Eastern pop and rap by North African artists from throughout the diaspora. And rural communities are shrinking amid the country's rapid development and urbanization. But though the future of aita may seem uncertain, its musicians and listeners remain confident that it will endure.",
      "\u201cAita will not die because it is renewed by young people. Aita will remain in all times and is loved by old people and young people as well. It is developed and improved, but they preserve its origins,\u201d said Rachid Kadari, a Cheikh who also sings aita."

      "It was also a telecast where the best new artist nominees like Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter were given plenty of time to show why there's a deep well of talent coming up. And there was a shock return for The Weeknd, who had been boycotting the Grammys.",
      "Here are some of the night\u2019s notable moments:",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga were right there, as were Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, but the honor of opening the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles was given to two local brothers deeply affected by the wildfires: Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of the band Dawes.",
      "They lost one brother\u2019s home along with their childhood home, instruments and much else. They've advocated for victims, raised money and were included in the FireAid benefit concert on Thursday.",
      "\u201cThey truly epitomize the unique spirit that we are seeing in LA right now,\u201d host Trevor Noah said. \u201cWhat better way to start the Grammy Awards?\u201d",
      "Dawes then played Randy Newman's \u201cI Love L.A.\u201d surrounded by an all-star backing band: John Legend, Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard and St. Vincent.",
      "\u201cLook at these firefighters, ain\u2019t nothin like \u2018em nowhere,\u201d Taylor Goldsmith sang, altering the line: \u201cLook at these women/There ain\u2019t nothing like \u2019em nowhere.\u201d",
      "Doechii won the Grammy for best rap album, only the third woman to win in that category. And, with her mother by her side, she had a strong message for young Black girls.",
      "\u201cI know that there's some Black girl out there, so many Black women out there, that are watching me right now, and I want to tell you: You can do it. Anything is possible. Anything is possible,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Don\u2019t allow anybody to project any stereotypes on you, to tell you that you can\u2019t be here, that you\u2019re too dark, or that you\u2019re not smart enough, or that you\u2019re too dramatic, or you\u2019re too loud. You are exactly who you need to be to be right where you are, and I am a testimony right now. Good night!\u201d",
      "The win caps an astounding few years for the 26-year-old Floridian who mixes R&B, hip-hop, jazz, boundary-pushing sounds and samples, and adds theatricality. She playfully calls herself the \u201cswamp princess.\u201d",
      "Her 2024 mixtape, \u201dAlligator Bites Never Heal\u2033 went to No. 33 on the Billboard 200, No. 9 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop chart and No. 8 on the Top Rap Album chart.",
      "Her Grammy performance of \u201cCatfish\u201d and \u201cDenial Is a River\u201d was electric, with the singer-songwriter backed by over a dozen dancers in matching Thom Browne suits and she eventually stripped down to a white two-piece set.",
      "Chappell Roan was crowned best new artist and then used her speech to demand change in the music business.",
      "\u201cI told myself that if I ever won a Grammy and got to stand up here before the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels in the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage and health care, especially to developing artists,\u201d she said.",
      "Roan began her music career in 2015 when she signed with Atlantic Records, releasing several singles including \u201cPink Pony Club.\u201d In 2020, the label dropped her. She moved back to her hometown to work as a barista before releasing her debut full-length album.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized,\u201d Roan said in her speech. \u201cRecord labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.\u201d",
      "Earlier, Roan performed a rocking version of her \u201cPink Pony Club,\u201d joined by a posse of dancing clown cowboys as she sang from atop a giant pink horse.",

      "\u201cTrans people are not invisible. Trans people deserve love. The queer community deserves to be lifted up. Music is love,\" Lady Gaga said.",
      "Not long after, Alicia Keys, being honored with The Dr. Dre Global Impact Award, also backed diversity and inclusion programs, another Trump target.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to shut down the diversity of voices,\u201d said Keys. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen on this stage talented, hardworking people from different backgrounds with different points of view, and it changes the game. DEI is not a threat, it\u2019s a gift.\u201d",
      "The Grammy Awards had a powerful way to prove that they've changed. They got a surprise endorsement by The Weeknd, who was last on the Grammy stage in 2017.",
      "The pop superstar in 2020 slammed the Grammys, calling them \u201ccorrupt\u201d after he landed zero nominations despite a megahit album. \u201cYou owe me, my fans and the industry transparency,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Grammys CEO Harvey Mason jr., who started in his post in 2020, on Sunday said he understood the criticism and listed all the things the Academy has done to fix it.",
      "\u201cWe have completely re-made our membership, adding more than 3,000 women voting members. The Grammy electorate is now younger, nearly 40% people of color, and 66% of our members are new since we started our transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the past few years, we have listened, we\u2019ve acted and we\u2019ve changed.\u201d",

      "Will Smith, hosting a tribute to the late Quincy Jones, marked his first appearance at a major awards show since since he slapped Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars in 2022.",
      "\u201cIn his 91 years, Q touched countless lives, but I have to say, he changed mine forever. You probably wouldn\u2019t even know who Will Smith was if it wasn\u2019t for Quincy Jones,\" Smith said.",

      "A woman from New Zealand says in lawsuits that British author Neil Gaiman sexually assaulted her repeatedly when she worked as a babysitter and nanny for him and his wife",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A woman from New Zealand has filed three civil lawsuits against best-selling British author Neil Gaiman and his wife, accusing Gaiman of repeatedly sexually assaulting her while she was working as the couple's babysitter and nanny.",
      "Scarlett Pavlovich filed the lawsuits in federal court in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and New York on Monday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. Pavlovich identified herself in an interview with New York Magazine, which published an article in January detailing allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women.",
      "Pavlovich alleges in the lawsuits that she was homeless and living on a beach when she met Palmer in Auckland, New Zealand, in 2020. Pavlovich was 22 years old at the time.",
      "According to the lawsuits, Gaiman's wife, Amanda Palmer, invited Pavlovich to the couple's home on Waiheke Island. Pavlovich began running errands for the couple, babysitting their son and helping with chores, eventually becoming the couple's nanny.",
      "Gaiman first sexually assaulted her the night they met in February 2022, according to the lawsuits. The assaults continued but she kept working for the couple because she was broke and homeless and Gaiman had told her he would help her writing career, according to the lawsuits.",
      "When she told Palmer about the assaults, Palmer told her that more than a dozen women had told her in the past that Gaiman had sexually abused them, according to the lawsuits.",
      "The assaults didn't stop until Pavlovich told Palmer she was going to kill herself, the lawsuits said. She left the family and became homeless again, although the documents say Gaiman eventually paid her for her work caring for the couple's child and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Palmer knew of Gaiman's sexual desires and presented Pavalovich to him knowing he would assault her, according the lawsuits. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman and Palmer violated federal human trafficking prohibitions and seeks at least $7 million in damages.",
      "After the New York Magazine article was published, Gaiman released a statement in January denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex. The allegations of four of the women were previously broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d Gaiman posted on the social media platform Tumblr.",
      "Representatives for Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday and online court records did not list attorneys representing them in the suits. Pavlovich\u2019s attorneys stated in the filings that Gaiman, author of such bestsellers as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cThe Sandman\u201d series, is a resident of Menomonie, Wisconsin. But they\u2019re unsure if Palmer resides in Massachusetts or New York.",
      "Pavlovich told New York Magazine that she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault. Police have not confirmed whether Gaiman was ever under investigation.",
      "Gaiman has worked with numerous publishers over the years. Two of them, HarperCollins and W.W. Norton, have said they have no plans to release his books in the future. Others, including Bloomsbury, have so far declined comment.",
      "Dark Horse Comics announced in January that it would no longer release its illustrated series based on Gaiman's novel, \u201cAnansi Boys.\u201d The seventh of eight editions was released earlier that month.",
      "Disney has paused a planned adaptation of Gaiman\u2019s \u201cThe Graveyard Book,\u201d while Netflix is still scheduled to release a second season based on \u201cThe Sandman.\u201d"

      "Filmmaker Christophe Ruggia was sentenced Monday to two years under house arrest with an electronic bracelet plus a two-year suspended sentence. Ruggia had denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Haenel, now 35, was the first top actor in France to accuse the film industry of turning a blind eye to sexual abuse after the #MeToo movement broke out. In 2019, she accused Ruggia of having repeatedly touched her inappropriately during and after filming of the movie \u201cLes Diables,\u201d or \u201cThe Devils,\u201d in the early 2000s.",
      "Haenel appeared relieved, breathing deeply, as Monday's verdict was being released. She was applauded by some women\u2019s rights activists as she left the courtroom.",

      "Last year, Godr\u00e8che accused film director Beno\u00eet Jacquot of having raped and physically abused her in a six-year relationship that began when she was 14 years old. Jacquot, who has more than 50 director credits in film and television, was handed preliminary charges of rape, sexual assault and violence in July 2024.",

      "\u201cLongevity was never a major concern of ours,\u201d 77-year-old guitarist Bob Weir said, drawing laughs. \u201cSpreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\u201d",
      "Drummer Mickey Hart paid homage to the band's free-spirited fans.",
      "\u201cThe Deadheads have kept the dream alive for 60 years now and continue to take this music into the next century,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore the world even knew what to make of us, our community lifted us up and kept us going. Without support there would be no Grateful Dead.\u201d",
      "Actor Woody Harrelson told a few long-winded tales about his adventures with the band, including \u201cgoing drugless to Thailand with Bobby, which is not easy for either of us.\u201d",
      "Weir and Hart were joined onstage to accept the award by three of their bandmates\u2019 offspring: Grahame Lesh, Trixie Garcia and Justin Kreutzmann.",
      "Lesh\u2019s father, Phil, died in October at age 84. Garcia\u2019s father, Jerry, died in 1995 at age 53. Kreutzmann\u2019s father, Bill, didn\u2019t attend and instead gave his thanks in a video message.",
      "\u201cI can feel his spirit in the house,\u201d the 81-year-old Hart said of Bill Kreutzmann. \u201cHe\u2019s in the music, he\u2019s in the rhythm, the heartbeat of everything we built together all these years.\u201d",
      "Grahame Lesh was busy all night playing guitar as part of the backing band led by musical director Don Was. He sang with The War on Drugs during \u201cBox of Rain,\u201d composed by his father.",
      "Weir opened the show on guitar backed by an orchestra. They soon gave way to The War and Treaty performing \u201cSamson and Delilah\u201d with Stewart Copeland and Mick Fleetwood taking turns on drum solos.",
      "Technical difficulties briefly affected performances by My Morning Jacket and John Mayer, who rebounded for an extended jam with Was and Jeff Chimenti on \u201cTerrapin Station.\u201d Hart kept looking offstage as he drummed during Dead & Company's finale of \u201cSugar Magnolia\u201d and \u201cTouch of Grey\u201d until a technician appeared to bring him in-ear monitors.",
      "Eaerlier, Hart was on his feet pumping his right arm to Sammy Hagar's version of \u201cLoose Lucy.\u201d",
      "\u201cBobby, Mick, love you brothers,\u201d Hagar said.",
      "Two of the quieter moments were in-the-round performances by Norah Jones on \u201cRipple\" and Bruce Hornsby doing \u201cStanding on the Moon.\u201d",

    "summary": "Film wasn&rsquo;t the only thing on people&rsquo;s minds at this year&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
    "story": [
      "Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Film wasn\u2019t the only thing on people\u2019s minds at this year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, which comes to a close Sunday in Park City, Utah ( and online ).",
      "The effects of the wildfires in Southern California loomed large, as did the bittersweet knowledge that this year will be the second to last Sundance based in Park City. Some films offered an escape from reality; others were a pointed reminder of the domestic and international political landscape, from transgender rights to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Here are some of the key takeaways from the 41st edition of the festival.",
      "The wildfires were still burning in parts of Los Angeles when Sundance began last week and reminders of its devastation were everywhere, even on screen. Max Walker-Silverman\u2019s \u201cRebuilding,\u201d starring Josh O\u2019Connor as a cowboy who loses his ranch in a wildfire and forms a community with fellow survivors in a FEMA camp, hit close to home for many.",
      "Filmmakers Meena Menon and Paul Gleason lost their home in Altadena where they filmed some of their zombie apocalypse movie \u201cDidn\u2019t Die.\u201d Sundance artist labs head Michelle Satter lost her Palisades home as well. Satter had an audience of Sundance Institute donors in tears early in the festival while accepting an honor at a fundraising gala.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a deeply devastating time for us and so many others, a moment that calls for all of us coming together to support our bigger community,\u201d Satter said. \u201cAs a friend recently noted, and I have to listen to this, \u2018Take a deep breath ... We lost our village, but at the end of the day we are the village.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was a topic bound to come up in nearly every conversation: The festival\u2019s new home in 2027. \u201cWhere do you think it will go? How do you feel about it leaving Park City? What would Sundance in Ohio even look like?\u201d No one had any answers, but everyone had an opinion about the fact that next year will be the last year in which the center of activity is in Park City. Sundance Institute leadership has narrowed the finalist cities to Salt Lake City, Utah, Boulder, Colorado, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and is expected to announce the winner before spring.",
      "Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the institute\u2019s board, was hopeful about a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that\u2019s evergreen,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cRegardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d",
      "In the early days of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, politics were also a main topic of private discussions at least. Several films (mostly documentaries) had direct relevance to recent news, like \u201cHeightened Scrutiny,\u201d about transgender lawyer Chase Strangio and the media coverage of transgender issues amid a pending Supreme Court case.",
      "Even \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d filmmaker Bill Condon quoted Trump\u2019s \u201ctwo genders\u201d mandate before his film screened.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a sentiment I think you\u2019ll see that the movie has a different point of view on,\u201d Condon said.",
      "There also wasn\u2019t the spirit of public protest that was unavoidable eight years ago when Trump first took office, when A-listers took to the streets to march for women's rights. But audiences at Q&As for films like \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d about the abusive Alabama prison systems which the AP has reported extensively on, were curious how they could help change things.",
      "There have been essentially two major deals out of the festival so far: Netflix took \u201cTrain Dreams,\u201d Clint Bentley\u2019s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation, with Joel Edgerton and Felicity Jones, and Neon acquired the Dave Franco and Alison Brie relationship body horror \u201cTogether.\u201d",
      "As always, some films came in with distribution in place: Focus Features with \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d; A24 with \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You,\u201d \u201cOpus,\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Ochi\u201d; Bleecker Street with \u201cThe Wedding Banquet\u201d; Nat Geo with the Sally Ride documentary \u201cSally\u201d; MUBI with \u201cMagic Farm\u201d; and Apple with \u201cDeaf President Now!\u201d; HBO Documentary Films with \u201cThe Alabama Solution\u201d and \u201cEnigma.\u201d",
      "Most deals happen after the festival ends, but there have been private grumblings that the market this year was weaker than usual, and the films were not commercial enough. Several insiders singled out Condon\u2019s adaptation of \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d with Jennifer Lopez as being too expensive for anyone but a streaming service. But there are also plenty of deals in the works, some of which will be finalized soon, while others may be settled at the Berlin Film Festival market.",
      "As festival programmers like to say, Sundance isn\u2019t the end of the story for new films \u2014 it\u2019s just the beginning. Last year\u2019s program had over 100 films distributed to audiences through traditional means, and only a small fraction of those were announced during the festival.",
      "Perhaps the biggest discovery of the festival is \u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d from writer-director-star Eva Victor in her feature debut. This funny and quietly piercing film is about Agnes, who was sexually assaulted by her thesis advisor. Instead of making it about depicting the incident itself (Victor keeps the camera firmly planted outside of the home where it occurs, showing the passage of time through light), Victor, who could be the next Greta Gerwig and/or Phoebe Waller-Bridge, stays focused on how it affects Anges.",
      "Filmmaker James Sweeney also scored a big win with \u201cTwinless,\u201d which picked up the U.S. dramatic audience prize and a special award for his star Dylan O\u2019Brien. The movie is about a bromance between two men in a twin bereavement group.",
      "On the documentary side there was much chatter about \u201cAndr\u00e9 Is an Idiot,\u201d a documentary about a \u201cbrilliant idiot\u201d who is dying because he didn\u2019t get a colonoscopy and trying to live out his final days happily.",
      "The in-person experience at Sundance is also a good reminder that reviews are only part of the equation when it comes to judging the response to a film. Hailey Gates\u2019 war satire \u201cAtropia\u201d got mixed reviews from critics, but premiere audiences were very enthusiastic (as was the U.S. dramatic jury who gave it the festival\u2019s top prize ).",
      "As of publication, all are still seeking distribution.",
      "Others that played notably well with audiences and critics include: \u201cIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You,\u201d \u201cDJ Ahmet,\u201d \u201cCactus Pears,\u201d \"2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d \u201cPlainclothes,\u201d \u201cRicky,\u201d \u201cPrime Minister,\u201d \u201cSelena y Los Dinos,\u201d \u201cThe Stringer,\u201d\u201cSLY LIVES!,\u201d \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d \u201cPredators,\u201d \u201cEast of Wall,\u201d \u201cFolktales,\u201d \u201cFree Leonard Peltier,\u201d \u201cPeter Hujar\u2019s Day,\u201d \u201cThe Ballad of Wallis Island\u201d and \u201cTrain Dreams.\u201d",

      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has ordered state employees back to full-time in-office work",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has ordered state employees back to their offices full-time starting next month.",
      "In an executive order issued Tuesday, DeWine required all permanent employees of state agencies, boards and commissions to resume five-day, in-office work weeks no later than March 17. He said the move will allow the state to best serve the public and to make best use of its remaining office space. Both are in the best interests of Ohio citizens, he wrote.",
      "The return date set by DeWine falls almost five years to the day after the state declared an emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 9, 2020, and allowed certain employees to work remotely.",
      "Many of those workers either returned to their offices full-time or on a hybrid basis starting in June 2021, when the emergency was lifted.",
      "Tuesday's order requires virtually all employees to now return. It allows agencies to grant exceptions in cases where some or all of their real estate portfolios have been eliminated. Lease terminations and space reallocations that resulted from the coronavirus pandemic saved Ohio taxpayers millions of dollars, the order says.",
      "According to the document, a majority of Ohio's state employees actually never worked remotely, due to the nature of their work at state hospitals, prisons, law enforcement agencies or in other jobs requiring a physical presence.",
      "DeWine's mandate comes as some major Columbus employers, including American Electric Power and JPMorganChase, also have required a return to five-day work weeks in March. Republican President Donald Trump also is requiring federal workers to return full-time to offices, an order that's as part of an unprecedented series of steps aimed at shrinking the federal government."

      "NEW YORK -- New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday told hospitals that they would be violating state law if they stop offering gender-affirming care for people under age 19 in response to an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at curtailing federal funding for such treatments.",
      "In a letter, James, a Democrat, told health care facilities that refusing to provide the treatments would violate New York's anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"Regardless of the availability of federal funding, we write to further remind you of your obligations to comply with New York State laws,\" her letter reads.",
      "Trump, a Republican, last week signed an executive order that directed agencies to take steps to make sure that hospitals receiving federal research and education grants \u201cend the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\u201d The language in the order \u2014 using words such as \u201cmaiming,\u201d \u201csterilizing\u201d and \u201cmutilation\u201d \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States.",
      "The letter from James came as some hospitals in Colorado, Virginia and Washington, D.C., said they were pausing gender-affirming treatments for young people while administrators evaluate the order. The White House on Monday released a statement that said the executive order was \u201calready having its intended effect.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Greater New York Hospital Association said they were in close contact with member hospitals about the gender-affirming care executive order.",
      "\u201cWe are collaboratively working through every aspect of the EO to determine its legal and clinical implications. That work is ongoing,\u201d Brian Conway said in an email.",
      "Gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth is not common but such treatments have been the subject of fierce political debate. Fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents in the U.S. with commercial insurance received puberty blockers or hormones during a recent five-year period, according to a new study."

      "Officials are investigating the source of the outbreak. Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",
      "Responding to this outbreak could prove difficult because Kampala has a highly mobile population of about 4 million. The nurse who died had sought treatment at a hospital just outside the capital and later traveled to Mbale in the country\u2019s east, where he was admitted to a public hospital. Health authorities said he also sought the services of a traditional healer.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein has asked state legislators to double their spending to date on Hurricane Helene recovery and approve it now",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein asked state legislators Monday to roughly double their spending so far on recovery from Hurricane Helene, warning that waiting will cause more business closings, housing construction delays and students falling behind.",
      "Speaking in a mountain county hit by the historic flooding, the new Democratic governor said he wants his $1.07 billion request enacted now by the Republican-controlled General Assembly \u2014 rather than wait for the two-year budget that starts in July, for which he'll make an additional Helene appeal.",
      "At a news conference at a food bank in Mills River, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) west of Raleigh, Stein said the funds are urgently needed in the first half of the year \u201cso that people can get their lives back together.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we do not act, some businesses will not be here in the summer, and we will miss an entire building season before the winter weather comes again,\u201d he warned, calling the funds a high priority.",
      "The largest chunks of his proposal, which contains no tax increases, would fund grants for struggling businesses; help repair and rebuild homes; clean up farm debris; fix private bridges and roads; and replace revenues spent or lost by local governments. There's also money for summer school in districts that lost at least 15 instructional days shortly after Helene's rampage last September.",
      "\u201cWe can ensure that our students are set up for long-term academic success.,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAll of these components are necessary to building a safer, stronger and more resilient western North Carolina, and they are needed now.\u201d",
      "The state legislature already appropriated last fall well over $900 million for relief and rebuilding efforts and earmarked a couple of hundred million more for that purpose in the future. New House Speaker Destin Hall has said getting bipartisan early-session Helene funding bill to Stein's desk was a top priority.",
      "Advancing Monday's package could provide an early test for Stein, who was sworn in last month, in his efforts to find consensus with Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger. While Republicans control both chambers, they are one seat short of a veto-proof majority.",
      "GOP Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County, who served on a bipartisan Helene advisory committee organized by Stein last year, spoke at the news conference with an optimistic tone.",
      "\u201cWe will start reviewing the governor\u2019s proposed budget and figuring out how we can get these dollars to people who need them the most right now,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Berger spokesperson Lauren Horsch said Monday that the Senate is reviewing Stein\u2019s proposal and anticipates considering Helene legislation in the coming weeks. Even with the money already put toward the recovery, Horsch added, \u201cthere is still more we can do.\u201d",
      "North Carolina state officials reported over 100 deaths from Helene with 74,000 homes and thousands of miles in both state-maintained and private roads damaged. The state budget office estimated that Helene caused a record $59.6 billion in damages and recovery needs. Congressional legislation approved in December and other federal actions are projected to provide over $15 billion to North Carolina for rebuilding.",
      "Helene made landfall last Sept. 26 in Florida\u2019s Big Bend and swept far inland, upending life throughout the Southeast. Officials have warned that rebuilding from the widespread loss of homes and property would be lengthy and difficult.",
      "Stein's request to spend money currently sitting in two reserves emphasizes speed.",
      "The $150 million sought for a home reconstruction, repair and buyout program is designed so such work can begin immediately while awaiting the distribution from Washington of similar housing assistance, which could take a year. The state program could assist at least 225 of 5,100 homes estimated to need rebuilding, Stein\u2019s request says.",
      "Stein also wants $150 million for two business grant programs designed to provide up to $75,000 to companies that suffered significant sales and economic losses, it physical damages.",
      "Stein said on Monday that \u201ctaking on additional business debt is simply not the answer for small businesses that are already struggling.\u201d",
      "In a special session last week, Tennessee lawmakers approved Gov. Bill Lee\u2019s $470 million package offering further aid for communities ravaged by Helene in the northeast part of that state. The package will help local governments cover loan interest on recovery costs, fuel agricultural and business recovery, fund disaster-related unemployment aid, and pay for rebuilding a badly damaged high school.",

      "The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012, when they first captured Goma before withdrawing under international pressure. They are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Unlike in 2012, the rebels say they now plan to march to Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasa, 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) away, describing the country as a failed state under President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi.",
      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) militia group. Rwanda said the group is \"fully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges.",
      "Medical workers at Kyeshero Hospital in Goma say they are treating an increasing number of patients with bullet wounds.",
      "\"We removed 48 bullets yesterday,\u201d Johnny Kasangati, a surgeon, said Friday as he examined a patient under a tent.",
      "Kyeshero is also severely overcrowded, hitting more than 200% of its capacity on some days, according to Joseph Amadomon Sagara, a project coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, which runs the hospital.",
      "In the past, hospitals in Goma could transport wounded patients by boat to South Kivu's main Bukavu city, 180 kilometers (111 miles) to the south, but transport across Lake Kivu was suspended during the rebellion and roads have been mostly cut.",
      "The fighting in and around Goma has also disrupted supply chains, leading to shortages in medical supplies that aid groups rely on. Some of it previously entered the city through its international airport, which is now under rebel control.",
      "\u201cGoma was cut off from the world. It was a total blackout,\" said Virginie Napolitano, Goma's emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders.",
      "The aid group's stockpiles, along with those of other groups, have been looted.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting by with what we had in the cabinets, but I don\u2019t know for how long,\u201d Napolitano said.",
      "Congo's government has confirmed 773 deaths and 2,880 injured persons at morgues and hospitals. The toll could be higher, it said, citing fears of finding mass graves and more bodies.",
      "The Maternit\u00e9 de la Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Goma was among those struggling to find space for the dead.",
      "\u201cWe had 66 bodies here. Fifty-six were transferred to the provincial hospital, where the morgue has more space than ours,\" said Jules Kafitiye, the hospital's medical director.",
      "\"We need to avoid decomposition due to disease,\u201d he added, pointing to a tent where bodies were being stored.",
      "Scores of bodies lay on streets and in hospitals in Goma after the city's capture, raising fears of disease outbreaks in the region, which is also facing mpox and cholera outbreaks.",
      "The U.N. health body warned last week that repeated mass displacement in Congo has created ideal conditions for the spread of endemic diseases in displacement camps and surrounding communities, including cholera, which saw more than 22,000 infections last year, and measles, which affected close to 12,000 people. The region also battles with chronic child malnutrition.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities,\u201d said Dr. Boureima Hama Sambo, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative in Congo. \u201cBut at this point, we cannot say because we have not been able to get there.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Many Africans knew that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d outlook meant their continent was likely to be last among his priorities",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Four days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order freezing almost all U.S. foreign aid, an email landed in Claris Madhuku's inbox in rural Zimbabwe. Stop all activities immediately, it said.",
      "The message confirmed Madhuku's fears that Trump's return to office might affect his organization's efforts to save African girls from child marriages.",
      "Many Africans had known that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d outlook meant their continent was likely to be last among his priorities. But they hadn't expected the abrupt halt to foreign aid from the world's largest donor that stops money flowing for wide-ranging projects like disease response, girls' education and free school lunches.",
      "Even after global outrage prompted some exemptions to Trump's order, sub-Saharan Africa could suffer more than any other region as most global aid pauses 90 days for a spending review. The U.S. gave the region more than $6.5 billion in humanitarian assistance last year.",
      "For Madhuku and countless others, the damage has been done. His Platform For Youth and Community Development is one of hundreds of small non-governmental organizations in Africa that receive assistance from the U.S. government \u2014 and ultimately from the American people \u2014 to do good work.",
      "Without U.S. aid, Madhuku's group can't give around 100 volunteers allowances for food and public transport as they do outreach seeking to keep girls in school and out of early marriages.",
      "\u201cWe had to stop everything, no warning, no time to adjust,\" Madhuku said. \u201cI appreciate that Trump might have some justification in trying to account for American taxpayers\u2019 money ... but it has caused disaster here.\u201d",
      "For many in Africa, thoughts immediately turned to arguably the world's most successful foreign aid program, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.",
      "Over two decades, the program with bipartisan support has been credited with saving more than 25 million lives, the vast majority in Africa, the continent it was designed to help most.",
      "\u201cThe world is baffled,\u201d the health minister of South Africa, the country with the most people living with HIV, said after the U.S. freeze on aid.",
      "The minister, Aaron Motsoaledi, said the U.S. funds nearly 20% of South Africa\u2019s $2.3 billion annual HIV/AIDS program through PEPFAR, and now the biggest response to a single disease in history is under threat.",
      "More than 8 million in South Africa live with HIV, and authorities say PEPFAR helps provide life-saving antiretroviral treatment to 5.5 million people every day.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that programs offering \u201clife-saving\u201d assistance including medicine, medical services, food and shelter would be exempted from the aid freeze, though what qualifies is not immediately clear.",
      "The United Nations AIDS program said many organizations receiving PEPFAR funding had closed due to the aid pause and there was \"lack of clarity and great uncertainty about the future.\u201d More than 20 million people globally receive HIV treatment with PEPFAR support, UNAIDS said.",
      "In South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg, and elsewhere, PEPFAR-funded facilities were still shut days after the exemptions were announced and HIV patients were referred to government hospitals and clinics.",
      "In Johannesburg's largest township, Soweto, two workers at the PEPFAR-funded HIVSA center turned patients away. And a notice at the renowned Wits RHI Key Populations Clinic, which serves adults and children living with HIV, read: \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience this causes.\"",
      "Experts said the effects on HIV programs remain unclear but the consequences could be swift, even dangerous.",
      "\"We need to know a lot more before we can say people won\u2019t die directly because of the pause to funding,\u201d said Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, noting that while the waiver should cover HIV drugs, HIV diagnostic tests are also critical to ensure treatment gets to those who need it.",
      "Kenny said even short interruptions to antiretroviral treatment \u2014 which stops the virus replicating in the body \u2014 are risky.",
      "\u201cHIV viral loads rebound in about three weeks if you go off antiretrovirals,\u201d he said.",
      "Overall, even senior officials in the aid community are not sure which U.S.-funded programs are allowed to at least briefly continue operations.",
      "The Trump administration has warned contractors and staffers with USAID \u2014 the agency responsible for dispersing America\u2019s foreign aid \u2014 they could be disciplined if they speak to anyone outside the agency without top-level approval, and aid groups fear they may permanently lose funds if they speak publicly.",
      "A humanitarian official told The Associated Press that at least 1.2 million people in Congo could lose life-saving support because of the aid freeze. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said almost half of their organization\u2019s funding is from USAID.",
      "Overall, more than $100 million for the organization\u2019s humanitarian programs in more than 30 countries worldwide has been halted, according to the official.",
      "The block on aid came during a major escalation in fighting in eastern Congo, where millions of people were already displaced and where outbreaks of the mpox virus were declared a global health emergency last year.",
      "In civil-war-torn Sudan, which is grappling with cholera, malaria, and measles, the aid freeze means 600,000 people will be at grave risk of catching and spreading those diseases, the official said.",
      "Even with the exemption for life-saving services, the official said their organization had been told they should not resume any USAID-funded activities until they received notification that the waiver applies to them.",

      "The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Alaska Gold Rush town of Nome faced a bleak winter. It was hundreds of miles from anywhere, cut off by the frozen sea and unrelenting blizzards, and under siege from a contagious disease known as the \u201cstrangling angel\u201d for the way it suffocated children.",
      "Now, 100 years later, Nome is remembering its saviors \u2014 the sled dogs and mushers who raced for more than five days through hypothermia, frostbite, gale-force winds and blinding whiteouts to deliver life-saving serum and free the community from the grip of diphtheria.",
      "Among the events celebrating the centennial of the 1925 \u201cGreat Race of Mercy\u201d are lectures, a dog-food drive and a reenactment of the final leg of the relay, all organized by the Nome Kennel Club.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fluff around celebrations like this, but we wanted to remember the mushers and their dogs who have been at the center of this heroic effort and ... spotlight mushing as a still-viable thing for the state of Alaska,\u201d said Diana Haecker, a kennel club board member and co-owner of Alaska\u2019s oldest newspaper, the Nome Nugget.",
      "\u201cPeople just dropped whatever they were doing,\" she said. \"These mushers got their teams ready and went, even though it was really cold and challenging conditions on the trail.\u201d",
      "Other communities are also marking the anniversary \u2014 including the village of Nenana, where the relay began, and Cleveland, Ohio, where the serum run's most famous participant, a husky mix named Balto, is stuffed and displayed at a museum.",
      "Jonathan Hayes, a Maine resident who has been working to preserve the genetic line of sled dogs driven on the run by famed musher Leonhard Seppala, is recreating the trip. Hayes left Nenana on Monday with 16 Seppala Siberian sled dogs, registered descendants of Seppala's team.",
      "Diphtheria is an airborne disease that causes a thick, suffocating film to develop at the back of the throat; it was once a leading cause of death for children. The antitoxin used to treat it was developed in 1890, and a vaccine in 1923; it is now exceedingly rare in the U.S.",
      "Nome, western Alaska\u2019s largest community, had about 1,400 residents a century ago. Its most recent supply ship had arrived the previous fall, before the Bering Sea froze, without any doses of the antitoxin. Those the local doctor, Curtis Welch, had were outdated, but he wasn't worried. He hadn\u2019t seen a case of diphtheria in the 18 years he had practiced in the area.",
      "Within months, that changed. In a telegram, Welch pleaded with the U.S. Public Health Service to send serum: \"An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here.\u201d",
      "The first death was a 3-year-old boy on Jan. 20, 1925, followed the next day by a 7-year-old girl. By the end of the month, there were more than 20 confirmed cases. The city was placed under quarantine.",
      "West Coast hospitals had antitoxin doses, but it would take time to get them to Seattle and then onto a ship for Seward, an ice-free port south of Anchorage. In the meantime, enough for 30 people was found at an Anchorage hospital.",
      "It still had to get to Nome. Airplanes with open-air cockpits were ruled out as unsuited for the weather. There were no roads or trains that reached Nome.",
      "Instead, officials shipped the serum by rail to Nenana in interior Alaska, some 675 miles (1,086 kilometers) from Nome via the frozen Yukon River and mail trails.",
      "Thanks to Alaska\u2019s new telegraph lines and the spread of radio, the nation followed along, captivated, as 20 mushers \u2014 many of them Alaska Natives \u2014 with more than 150 dogs relayed the serum to Nome. They battled deep snow, whiteouts so severe they couldn\u2019t see the dogs in front of them, and life-threatening temperatures that plunged at times to minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 51 degrees Celsius).",
      "The antitoxin was transported in glass vials covered with padded quilts. Not a single vial broke.",
      "Seppala, a Norwegian settler, left from Nome to meet the supply near the halfway point and begin the journey back. His team, led by his dog Togo, traveled more than 250 miles (320 kilometers) of the relay, including a treacherous stretch across frozen Norton Sound.",
      "After about 5 1/2 days, the serum reached its destination on Feb. 2, 1925. A banner front-page headline in the San Francisco Chronicle proclaimed: \u201cDogs victors over blizzard in battle to succor stricken Nome.\u201d",
      "The official record listed five deaths and 29 illnesses. It\u2019s likely the toll was higher; Alaska Natives were not accurately tracked.",
      "Seppala and Togo missed the limelight that went to his assistant, Gunnar Kaasen, who drove the dog team led by Balto into Nome. Balto was another of Seppala\u2019s dogs, but was used to only haul freight after he was deemed too slow to be on a competitive team.",
      "Balto was immortalized in movies and with statues in New York's Central Park and one in Anchorage intended as a tribute to all sled dogs. He received a bone-shaped key to the city of Los Angeles, where legendary movie actress Mary Pickford placed a wreath around his neck.",
      "But he and several team members were eventually sold and kept in squalid conditions at a dime museum in Los Angeles. After learning of their plight, an Ohio businessman spearheaded an effort to raise money to bring them to Cleveland. After dying in 1933, Balto was mounted and placed on display at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.",
      "Today, the most famous mushing event in the world is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, which is not based on the serum run but on the Iditarod Trail, a supply route from Seward to Nome. Iditarod organizers are nevertheless marking the serum run's centennial, with a series of articles on its website and by selling replicas of the medallions each serum run musher received a century ago, race spokesperson Shannon Noonan said in an email. This year's Iditarod starts March 1.",
      "\u201cThe Serum Run demonstrated the critical role sled dogs played in the survival and communication of remote Alaskan communities, while the Iditarod has evolved into a celebration of that tradition and Alaska\u2019s pioneering spirit,\u201d Noonan said.",

    "story": [
      "A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt on Saturday for treatment",
      "RAFAH CROSSING, Egypt -- A group of 50 sick and wounded Palestinian children began crossing to Egypt for treatment through Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing on Saturday, the first opening of the border since Israel captured it nearly nine months ago.",
      "The reopening of the Rafah crossing represents a significant breakthrough that bolsters the ceasefire deal Israel and Hamas agreed last month. Israel agreed to reopen the crossing after Hamas released the last living female hostages in Gaza.",
      "Egypt's Al-Qahera television showed at least two Palestinian Red Cross ambulances pulling up to the crossing gate. Several children were brought out on gurneys and transferred to ambulances on the Egyptian side. From there, they were rushed to hospitals in the nearby Egyptian city of el-Arish and elsewhere. Footage showed one young girl whose foot had been amputated.",
      "Zaher al-Wahidi, an official with Gaza's Health Ministry, said 37 of the children had crossed into Egypt by Saturday evening.",
      "The Health Ministry said around 60 family members were accompanying the children.",
      "The children are the first in what are meant to be regular evacuations of Palestinians through the crossing for treatment abroad.",
      "Over the past 15 months, Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in retaliation for the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel has decimated Gaza\u2019s health sector, leaving most of its hospitals out of operation even as more than 110,000 Palestinians were wounded by Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground offensives, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry.",
      "Remaining facilities are unable to perform many crucial treatments or specialized surgeries for wounds or diseases. Mohammed Zaqout, the director of hospitals in Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said more than 6,000 patients were ready to be evacuated abroad, and more than 12,000 patients were in urgent need of treatment. He said the small numbers set to be evacuated will not cover the need, \u201cand we hope the number will increase.\u201d",
      "Rafah is Gaza\u2019s only crossing that does not enter into Israel. Israeli forces closed the crossing in early May after seizing it during an offensive on the southern city. Egypt shut down its side of the passage in protest.",
      "Even before the Gaza war began, the Rafah crossing represented a crucial escape valve from the territory, where a 15-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade aimed at containing Hamas undermined health facilities and impoverished the population. Palestinians routinely applied for permission to travel outside the territory for lifesaving treatments not available in Gaza, including chemotherapy.",
      "It took some diplomatic gymnastics to reopen the crossing and overcome security disputes between Israeli, Egyptian and Palestinian officials. Hamas had overseen the border since 2007, when it took control of Gaza from its rival, the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, or PA, after winning parliamentary elections in 2006.",
      "Israeli troops remain at the Rafah crossing and in the Philadelphia Corridor, a band of land running the length of the border. Israel has refused to allow Hamas to resume management of the crossing, accusing it of smuggling weapons through tunnels under the border, though Egypt says it destroyed the tunnels from its side and stopped smuggling years ago. Israel also refuses to allow the Palestinian Authority to officially run the crossing.",
      "Instead, the crossing will be staffed by Palestinians from Gaza who previously served as border officers with the PA, but they will not be allowed to wear official PA insignia, a European diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to brief the media. Israel has screened the officers to ensure they have no affiliation with Hamas, the European diplomat added.",
      "European Union monitors will also be present, as they were before 2007.",
      "Negotiations on the second phase of the deal \u2014 which calls for a permanent ceasefire, full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of any remaining hostages \u2014 are supposed to begin Monday. Israel has resisted the notion that the PA would control postwar Gaza."

    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:26:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world&rsquo;s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
    "story": [
      "A new study finds that rat infestation in many of the world\u2019s cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rat infestation in many world cities appears to be soaring, especially in Washington, and a new study blames climate change, urbanization and other human actions.",
      "A first-of-its-kind examination of trends and reasons in hard-to-count rat populations uses rat sighting reports in 16 cities around the world. In 11 of those cities, rat complaints have increased, according to a study in Friday's journal Science Advances.",
      "Based on individual trends within cities, Washington was by far the leader in rat increases, followed by San Francisco, Toronto, New York City and Amsterdam. Washington's rising rat reporting trend was three times greater than Boston's and 50% more than New York's, the study said. Washington city officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Only three cities saw significant decreasing trends \u2014 New Orleans, Louisville and Tokyo \u2014 with the home of Mardi Gras showing the biggest drop in rat reporting. Experts said the Louisiana city can teach others how to combat the rat problem.",
      "Researchers did a statistical analysis of the rising rat reporting in those cities and concluded that slightly more than 40% of the trend seen is due to warming temperatures from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. And that comes down to sex and food, said study lead author Jonathan Richardson, a biologist at the University of Richmond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these increasing trends in rats in cities that are warming the fastest, probably because this is a small mammal that has physiological challenges in the cold weather months,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIf we're warming the climate and winter starts a week or two later and spring arrives a week or two earlier, that's one, two, maybe even three or four weeks across the entire year where those rats can be above ground foraging, acquiring more food and maybe squeezing out one or two more reproductive cycles. \u201d",
      "An extra month may not sound like much, but female rats can have a litter every month. Each litter is eight to 16 baby rats, Richardson said: \u201cThat is a recipe for accelerated population growth.\u201d",
      "Researchers pointed to two other big statistical links \u2014 that fit with known biological issues \u2014 behind more rat reports: the increase in urbanization and more densely populated cities.",
      "Rats like the built-up environment and being near people and their waste, the study and outside scientists said. They essentially eat at the same table as humans, multiple experts said.",
      "\u201cThe rat is the third most successful mammal behind humans and house mice. So it evolved and engineered to live alongside us,\u201d New York City rat czar Kathleen Corradi said during a break at a New Orleans conference on improving pest management. \u201cThey followed humans, Homo sapiens, across the continents and are in every single continent except Antarctica. So it's considered a wicked problem.\u201d",
      "Even though rats are intelligent and highly adaptive, Richardson and other experts said they are a serious problem for people.",
      "\u201cWhen rodent populations are high, people get sick, motor vehicles become disabled, mental health declines, fires are started and foods fouled,\u201d said Houston rat expert Michael Parsons, who wasn't part of the study. People are rightly bothered by rats because of \u201can innate fear caused by an organism that can make us sick.\u201d",
      "Researchers have not had good figures on rats. Because of the way they live and hide, they are not as easily counted as other critters, so this is one of the first attempts to quantify them. The study is not really a count of rats, but of complaints by people.",
      "Because the statistics go back years and only cities that haven't changed their reporting methods were looked at, Richardson said the trends they spotted have scientific merit. Even though Washington has the highest increasing trend that doesn't mean it has more rats or even rat sightings, it is just that the numbers within the city are increasing fastest, he said.",
      "Several outside experts said the study is legitimate, sensible and was sorely needed.",
      "\u201cThis paper is by far the largest data-driven effort to understand changes in urban rat populations ever attempted,\u201d said Drexel University ecology professor Jason Munshi-South, who wasn't part of the research.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization chief asked global leaders to lean on Washington to reverse President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the U.N. health agency, insisting in a closed-door meeting with diplomats last week that the U.S. will miss out on critical information about global disease outbreaks.",
      "But countries also pressed WHO at a key budget meeting last Wednesday about how it might cope with the exit of its biggest donor, according to internal meeting materials obtained by The Associated Press. A German envoy, Bjorn Kummel, warned: \u201cThe roof is on fire, and we need to stop the fire as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "For 2024-2025, the U.S. is WHO\u2019s biggest donor by far, putting in an estimated $988 million, roughly 14% of WHO\u2019s $6.9 billion budget.",
      "A budget document presented at the meeting showed WHO\u2019s health emergencies program has a \u201cheavy reliance\u201d on American cash. \u201cReadiness functions\u201d in WHO\u2019s Europe office were more than 80% reliant on the $154 million the U.S. contributes.",
      "The document said U.S. funding \u201cprovides the backbone of many of WHO's large-scale emergency operations,\u201d covering up to 40%. It said responses in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan were at risk, in addition to hundreds of millions of dollars lost by polio-eradication and HIV programs.",
      "The U.S. also covers 95% of WHO's tuberculosis work in Europe and more than 60% of TB efforts in Africa, the Western Pacific and at the agency headquarters in Geneva, the document said.",
      "At a separate private meeting on the impact of the U.S. exit last Wednesday, WHO finance director George Kyriacou said if the agency spends at its current rate, the organization would \u201cbe very much in a hand-to-mouth type situation when it comes to our cash flows\u201d in the first half of 2026. He added the current rate of spending is \u201csomething we're not going to do,\" according to a recording obtained by the AP.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s executive order, WHO has attempted to withdraw funds from the U.S. for past expenses, Kyriacou said, but most of those \u201chave not been accepted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. also has yet to settle its owed contributions to WHO for 2024, pushing the agency into a deficit, he added.",
      "WHO's executive board, made up of 34 high-level envoys including many national health ministers, was expected to discuss budget matters during its latest session, which opens Monday and is set to run through Feb. 11.",
      "Last week, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were instructed to stop working with WHO immediately.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the attendees at the budget meeting that the agency is still providing U.S. scientists with some data \u2014 though it isn't known what data.",
      "\u201cWe continue to give them information because they need it,\u201d Tedros said, urging member countries to contact U.S officials. \u201cWe would appreciate it if you continue to push and reach out to them to reconsider.\u201d",
      "Among other health crises, WHO is currently working to stop outbreaks of Marburg virus in Tanzania, Ebola in Uganda and mpox in Congo.",
      "Tedros rebutted Trump\u2019s three stated reasons for leaving the agency in the executive order signed on Jan. 20 \u2014 Trump's first day back in office. In the order, the president said WHO mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China, failed to adopt needed reforms and that U.S. membership required \u201cunfairly onerous payments.\"",
      "Tedros said WHO alerted the world in January 2020 about the potential dangers of the coronavirus and has made dozens of reforms since \u2014 including efforts to expand its donor base.",
      "Tedros also said he believed the U.S. departure was \u201cnot about the money\u201d but more about the \u201cvoid\u201d in outbreak details and other critical health information that the United States would face in the future.",
      "\u201cBringing the U.S. back will be very important,\" he told meeting attendees. \"And on that, I think all of you can play a role.\u201d",
      "Kummel, a senior advisor on global health in Germany's health ministry, described the U.S. exit as \u201cthe most extensive crisis WHO has been facing in the past decades.\u201d",
      "He also asked: \u201cWhat concrete functions of WHO will collapse if the funding of the U.S. is not existent anymore?\u201d",
      "Officials from countries including Bangladesh and France asked what specific plans WHO had to deal with the loss of U.S. funding and wondered which health programs would be cut as a result.",
      "The AP obtained a document shared among some WHO senior managers that laid out several options, including a proposal that each major department or office might be slashed in half by the end of the year.",
      "WHO declined to comment on whether Tedros had privately asked countries to lobby on the agency's behalf.",
      "Some experts said that while the departure of the U.S. was a major crisis, it might also serve as an opportunity to reshape global public health.",
      "Less than 1% of the U.S. health budget goes to WHO, said Matthew Kavanagh, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Global Health Policy and Politics. In exchange, the U.S. gets \u201ca wide variety of benefits to Americans that matter quite a bit,\u201d he said. That includes intelligence about disease epidemics globally and virus samples for vaccines.",
      "Kavanagh also said the WHO is \"massively underfunded,\u201d describing the contributions from rich countries as \u201cpeanuts.\u201d",
      "WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said at the meeting on the impact of the U.S. withdrawal last week that losing the U.S. was \u201cterrible,\u201d but member states had \u201ctremendous capacity to fill in those gaps.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Defense Department will no longer reimburse service members for travel out of state to get reproductive health care, including abortions and fertility treatments, according to a new memo.",
      "The directive signed this week eliminates a rarely used Biden administration policy enacted in October 2022, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and more states began to impose increased abortion restrictions.",
      "Signed on Wednesday by Jeffrey Register, the director of the Pentagon's human resources department, the memo simply shows red lines crossing out the previous regulation and offers no other guidance.",
      "Asked if service members would still be allowed time off to travel at their own expense, the department had no immediate answer.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the policy change \u201cshameful.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service members go wherever they need to in order to bravely serve our country \u2014 and because President Trump\u2019s extremist Supreme Court overturned Roe, where they and their families are stationed quite literally dictates their access to critical reproductive care,\u201d Warren said in a statement. \u201cNow, Trump is turning his back on our servicemembers \u2014 and our servicewomen in particular \u2014 to score political points. It\u2019s shameful, and will only make our troops and our nation less safe.\u201d",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin instituted the policy in October 2022 to ensure that troops who were assigned to states where abortions or other types of health care such as IVF treatment were no longer provided could still access those services.",
      "The Defense Department on Friday was unable to say how many times the reimbursement policy was used, or the costs. But last March, officials said it had been used by service members or their dependents just 12 times from June to December 2023. And the total cost was roughly $40,000 to cover transportation, lodging and meals.",
      "The policy did not cover the cost of abortions, and it\u2019s not clear how many of the 12 trips were for abortions or other type of reproductive health care, such as IVF treatment. That specific medical information is protected by health privacy law.",
      "In his memo at the time, Austin said service members and their families were worried they may not get equal access to health care, including abortions. And he noted that service members who often must move for various missions or training would be forced to travel farther, take more time off work and pay more to access reproductive health care.",
      "The problem, Austin said, would create extraordinary hardship and \"interfere with our ability to recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.\u201d",
      "He ordered the department to allow troops and dependents, consistent with federal law, to take time off and use official travel to get to other states for reproductive care not available locally. That care includes in vitro fertilization and other pregnancy aids that also may not be accessible close by.",
      "Under federal law, Defense Department medical facilities can perform abortions only when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or in cases of rape or incest, and those instances have been extremely rare. According to the department, there were 91 abortions performed in military medical facilities between 2016 and 2021."

      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "Carpenter did not immediately return a message.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we\u2019ve witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women\u2019s rights,\u201d the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s indictment could be the first direct test of New York\u2019s shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cWe always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn\u2019t the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That\u2019s why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients,\u201d New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They\u2019re also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed."

      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",

Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",

      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",

      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common.

      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",

      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids.

Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",

      "Andrea Zanoni of the Europa Verde party in the northern Veneto region cited a video posted on the Field Ethos website for male adventurers founded by Trump. It shows Trump on a recent hunt in the wetlands in the Valle Pierimpie\u2019 bordering the Venice Lagoon.",

      "The video picked up by Italian media does not indicate who killed the duck. It was not clear when the hunt took place, but Italian media said Trump was in Italy in December and a Christmas tree was seen.",
      "Zanoni appealed to Veneto legislators to take action in coordination with Luana Zanella, a Greens lawmaker in Italy\u2019s lower house, who appealed to Italy\u2019s environment minister.

      "BAGHDAD -- Iraq\u2019s top court suspended implementation Tuesday of three controversial bills passed last month by the country\u2019s parliament, including a measure that activists said undermines women\u2019s rights.",
      "A number of members of parliament filed a complaint alleging that the voting process was illegal because all three bills \u2014 each supported by different blocs \u2014 were voted on last month together rather than each one being voted on separately. The Federal Supreme Court issued an order, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, to suspend their implementation until the case is adjudicated.",
      "The measures include an amendment to the country\u2019s personal status law to give Islamic courts increased authority over family matters, including marriage, divorce and inheritance.",
      "Women\u2019s rights advocates argue that the changes undermine previous reforms that created a unified family law and established safeguards for women. Proponents of the amendments, which were advocated by primarily conservative Shiite lawmakers, defend them as a means to align the law with Islamic principles and reduce Western influence on Iraqi culture.",
      "Earlier versions of the measure were seen as potentially opening the door to child marriage since some interpretations of Islamic law allow the marriage of girls in their early teens \u2014 or as young as 9. The final version passed by the parliament states that both parties must be \u201cadults,\u201d without specifying the age of adulthood.",
      "The second bill was for a general amnesty law seen as benefiting Sunni detainees. Some fear it could allow the release of people involved in public corruption and embezzlement as well as militants who committed war crimes.",
      "The third bill aimed to return lands confiscated from the Kurds under the rule of Saddam Hussein. It is opposed by some Arab groups, saying it could lead to the displacement of Arab residents."

      "Still, about 2 meters (6.5 feet) of water fell across the state since Saturday, with six months of rain recorded in some areas.

      "The West Bank's Jewish-settler population rose by roughly 2.3% \u2014 over 12,000 people \u2014 last year, reaching 529,450, according to a report by West Bank Jewish Population Stats.",
      "That was a slight dip from the 2.9% growth rate in 2023, but roughly double the 1.1% population growth rate inside Israel proper.",

      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has built about 130 settlements and dozens of settlement outposts in a bid to cement its control over the territory. The Palestinians seek the area as the heartland of a future state and say the presence of settlements makes independence impossible.",
      "Nearly all of the international community, including the former Biden administration, opposes the settlements as obstacles to peace.",

      "That track record has raised hopes among Israel\u2019s settlers that they could be entering a new period of rapid growth. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is dominated by settler supporters and he has placed a prominent settler leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, in charge of settlement planning.",

      "The report does not include east Jerusalem, where it estimates 340,000 Jewish settlers live. Israel says these settlers are residents of neighborhoods of its capital, while the international community considers these areas to be settlements.",
      "Inside the gated settlement of Beit El, on a hilltop abutting several Palestinian villages in the central West Bank, construction is continuing apace. It\u2019s a rapidly developing community, where high-rise luxury condominiums finished last year can now house 300 families and construction workers are working on a new dormitory for a Jewish seminary.",

      "ANKARA -- Syria\u2019s interim president was in the Turkish capital on Tuesday for talks expected to focus on Syria\u2019s economic recovery as well as the presence of Kurdish-led forces in the north of the country that Turkey considers to be a security threat.",
      "Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was appointed interim president last week, appeared to have been welcomed in Ankara with a low-key ceremony compared to other heads of state, who are usually received with military bands and mounted troops escorting them on arrival.",
      "Al-Sharaa, the former rebel leader who headed the insurgents who toppled President Bashar Assad in December, is making his second international trip following his visit to Saudi Arabia.",
      "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan greeted al-Sharaa, who was dressed in a suit and a red tie \u2014 an apparent nod to the Turkish flag \u2014 with a small group of the honor guard at the entrance of the vast presidential palace complex.",

      "Erdogan\u2019s office said talks would focus on steps toward Syria\u2019s economic recovery and its security and stability.",
      "Turkey, which shares a 910-kilometer (565-mile) border with Syria, views the Syrian Kurdish militias that make up the key component of the U.S.-allied, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party. It is pressing for the group to disband.",
      "Turkish-backed fighters are currently battling the SDF in a bid to push the Kurdish militias away from the Turkish border.",
      "Mazloum Abdi, the commander of the SDF, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday that he recently met with al-Sharaa in Damascus, adding that the two sides are negotiating with the help of mediators to find compromises regarding Syria\u2019s future, including the future of the Kurds.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The head of the U.N. atomic watchdog said Tuesday he will visit Moscow in the coming days to speak with officials about Russia's persistent attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure which threaten nuclear safety.",
      "International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi also said there were \u201ca few occasions where we had close calls\u201d with regard to Europe's largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia which is under Russian occupation. Grossi did not condemn either side for attacks on the plant saying because it lay so close to the front line it was hard to determine responsibility.",
      "More than half of Ukraine\u2019s power is generated by three functioning nuclear plants and Russia has increasingly threatened their ability to function.",
      "Meanwhile, the Zaporizhzhia plant, which is not under Ukraine's control, in the southeast of the country, was occupied by Russia in the opening days of the full-scale invasion. It is one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world.",
      "Grossi visited an electrical substation in the Kyiv region of Ukraine Tuesday and said that damage to such key power grid facilities during the war poses a threat to nuclear safety by potentially disrupting vital cooling procedures at atomic plants.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to cripple Ukraine\u2019s power grid, denying the country heat, electricity and running water in an effort to break the Ukrainian spirit. The attacks have also sought to disrupt Ukraine\u2019s defense manufacturing industry.",
      "The war has brought fears of a nuclear catastrophe as Zaporizhzhia has repeatedly been caught in the crossfire of fighting, and while its six reactors have been shut down for months, it still needs power and qualified staff to operate crucial cooling systems and other safety features.",
      "Russia has been attacking electricity substations which can also threaten nuclear safety.",

      "Despite more than a year of warnings that critical Ukrainian nuclear energy infrastructure sites are vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, Ukraine's Energy Ministry has failed to act swiftly to protect them, government officials have told The Associ...",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Moscow\u2019s renewed attacks on Ukraine\u2019s electricity infrastructure this winter have heightened scrutiny over the Ukrainian Energy Ministry's failure to protect the country\u2019s most critical energy facilities near nuclear power sites.",
      "Despite more than a year of warnings that the sites were vulnerable to potential Russian attacks, the Energy Ministry failed to act swiftly, current and former Ukrainian officials in Kyiv told The Associated Press.",
      "Two years of punishing Russian strikes on its power grid have left Ukraine reliant on nuclear power for more than half of its electricity generation. Especially vulnerable are the unprotected nuclear switchyards located outside the perimeters of its three functioning nuclear plants, which are crucial to transmitting power from the reactors to the rest of the country.",
      "\u201cThe switchyards that handle electrical routing from nuclear power plants are a vital component of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear energy infrastructure \u2014 powering homes, schools, hospitals and other critical civilian infrastructure,\" said Marcy R. Fowler, head of the office for research and analysis at Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens that focuses on reducing nuclear risk.",
      "\u201cGiven Ukraine\u2019s heavy reliance on nuclear energy, military attacks on these switchyards would be devastating, severely impacting civilian life and undermining the resilience of the energy grid,\u201d she said.",
      "Only in the fall, after Ukrainian intelligence agencies warned of potential Russian strikes targeting the nuclear switchyards, was action taken to begin building protection \u2014 far too late in the event of an attack, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf two (nuclear switchyards) are hit, we are out of supply for a minimum of 30 to 36 hours, and there will be a huge limitation on energy supply for at least three weeks, best-case scenario,\u201d said Oleksandr Kharchenko, a Ukrainian energy industry expert.",
      "He said it would take three to five weeks to transport and install new equipment, a miserable scenario for Ukraine's people during the bitterly cold winter months.",
      "Even more worrying, nuclear switchyards also have a second critical function: delivering electricity to nuclear plants from the offsite grid that is essential to cooling their reactors and spent fuel. A disruption could potentially spell disaster, the U.N. nuclear agency has repeatedly warned since the Russian attacks began in August.",
      "And while Ukraine's nuclear plants have backup emergency power systems, these \u201care designed to provide temporary support,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cWithout functioning switchyards, the backup systems alone would not be sufficient to sustain operations or prevent safety risks during an extended outage.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers cited failure to protect these sites in a resolution last month calling for the removal of Energy Minister Herman Haluschenko. The list of grievances, which also censured Haluschenko for alleged systematic corruption and inadequate oversight of the energy sector, must still be voted on by parliament.",
      "Haluschenko maintained at a news conference Tuesday the allegations were \u201ca manipulation\u201d and that fortifications for the electrical grid were \u201cdone.\u201d But he would not answer direct questions about whether Ukraine's nuclear switchyards in particular were protected.",
      "\u201cToday we have light, we have no restrictions\" on electricity, he said, suggesting that was proof that despite \u201cmassive attacks\u201d on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, fortifications were in place.",
      "Russian attacks in November and December came dangerously close to the country\u2019s nuclear power plants, causing five out of its nine operating reactors to reduce power generation. The attacks did not strike the nuclear switchyards about a kilometer (half-mile) away from reactor sites but came alarmingly close.",
      "The task of building protections for energy transmission substations, both nuclear and non-nuclear, fell to state and private companies, with the Energy Ministry supervising.",
      "Three layers of fortifications were ordered: sandbags followed by cement barricades capable of withstanding drone attacks and \u2014 the most costly and least complete \u2014 iron-and-steel-fortified structures.",
      "Following a government decree in July 2023, many state energy companies began immediately contracting to build first- and second-layer fortifications for their most critical power facilities. In the spring of 2024, the government repeated the urgent call to get the work done.",
      "But nuclear switchyards, under the responsibility of Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom, did not issue contracts to build second-layer concrete fortifications until this fall. By then, state energy company Ukrenergo, which manages the high-voltage substations that transmit power from the nuclear reactors to the grid, had already completed 90% of its 43 sites.",
      "The bidding process for two nuclear plants \u2014 in Khmelnytskyi and Mykolaiv \u2014 only started in early October, according to documents seen by the AP. The tender for the Rivne Nuclear Power Plant was even later, at the end of November.",
      "Construction is not expected to be completed until 2026, the contract documents said.",
      "Concerns over the delays were raised repeatedly in closed-door meetings and letters sent to energy officials over the last year, three current and former government officials told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the foot-dragging by the Energy Ministry.",
      "\u201cWe wrote officially to the Energy Ministry several times stating this problem over the last 12 to 14 months,\u201d said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, the former head of Ukrenergo, who was fired in September and blamed for the failures to protect the energy infrastructure \u2014 a move widely criticized as politically motivated.",
      "Energy Minister Haluschenko gave reassurances the situation was under control and prioritized other projects, including lobbying for parliamentary approval for the construction of costly nuclear reactors that take up to a decade to build.",
      "Ukraine's Western partners were also repeatedly told \u201call\u201d critical infrastructure was protected, according to two Western diplomats with knowledge of Western financial assistance to the country\u2019s energy sector, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue.",
      "Energoatom did not respond to requests for comment from the AP about the delays, citing the sensitivity of the issue.",
      "Over the summer and again in December, Ukraine raised the alarm internationally about potential Russian attacks targeting nuclear infrastructure and compromising nuclear safety. In mid-December it convened an extraordinary session of the International Atomic Energy Agency after attacks a month earlier damaged electrical substations deemed crucial to Ukraine\u2019s nuclear safety, heightening the possibility of a nuclear emergency.",
      "The U.N. nuclear agency sent teams in December to electrical substations at Ukraine\u2019s Khmelnytskyi, Rivne, and South Ukraine nuclear power plants to document damage and gathered evidence \u201chighlighting the electricity grid\u2019s vulnerabilities as a result of attacks,\u201d the agency's Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement in January.",
      "\u201cThese attacks impact grid stability and jeopardize the reliability of the off-site power supply, creating risks to nuclear safety,\u201d Grossi said, warning of similar concerns at the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest.",
      "The presence of the IAEA inspection teams led some in the Ukrainian government to believe the country's nuclear sites were off-limits for Russian attacks, said a senior Ukrainian official who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the delays.",
      "But that has proven to be a major miscalculation.",
      "\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they react?\u201d Kudrytskyi, the former Ukrenergo director, said of the Energy Ministry's failure to quickly respond to the series of warnings. \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer to that.\u201d",

      "A panel of expects is disputing the medical evidence used to convict British nurse Lucy Letby of murdering seven newborns and trying to kill seven others",
      "LONDON -- A panel of expects has disputed the medical evidence used to convict British nurse Lucy Letby of murdering seven newborns and trying to kill seven others, a doctor who led the examination said Tuesday.",
      "Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said the group of 14 doctors concluded the newborns either died of natural causes or from bad medical care.",
      "\u201cIn summary then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find murders,\u201d Lee said at a London news conference.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murder and attempted murder while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "Defense lawyer Mark McDonald said there was now \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d that Letby was wrongly convicted.",
      "It was the second news conference held in part by McDonald to challenge the conclusions of Dr. Dewi Evans, who was the prosecution's key expert witness.",
      "Prosecutors said Letby left little trace when she killed babies and in some cases had injected air into their bloodstreams or stomach, causing an embolism.",
      "But Lee said Evans had misinterpreted his 1989 academic paper on embolism.",
      "Lee said he assembled a prestigious group of international medical experts who volunteered to review the records of 17 babies Letby was accused of injuring or killing.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesian authorities on Tuesday were set to return an ailing French national who has been on death row in the Southeast Asian country, under an arrangement between the two nations.",
      "Serge Atlaoui, who has spent almost 20 years in an Indonesian prison for drug offenses, won a last-minute reprieve from execution by a 13-member firing squad in 2015, after France's government stepped up pressure because Atlaoui still had an outstanding court appeal.",
      "Indonesia executed eight others in May 2015, but Atlaoui was granted a stay of execution. An Administrative Court in Jakarta denied his last court appeal the following month.",
      "The father of four, who is now 61 and reportedly suffering from cancer, made a last-ditch plea to be returned home in December by writing to the Indonesian government requesting to serve the rest of his sentence in France.",

      "Atlaoui was arrested in 2005 for his alleged involvement in a factory manufacturing the psychedelic drug MDMA, sometimes called ecstasy, on the outskirts of Jakarta. His lawyers say he was employed as a welder at the factory and did not understand what the chemicals on the premises were used for.",
      "Atlaoui, from Metz, has maintained his innocence during his 19 years behind bars, claiming he was installing machinery in what he thought was an acrylics plant. Police accused him of being a \"chemist\" at the site. He was initially sentenced to life, but the Supreme Court in 2007 increased the sentence to death on appeal.",
      "About 530 people are on death row in Indonesia, mostly for drug-related crimes, including nearly 100 foreigners, Ministry of Immigration and Corrections\u2019 data shows. Indonesia\u2019s last executions, of an Indonesian citizen and three foreigners, were carried out in July 2016.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s government in December returned Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipina woman who had been on death row and who was nearly executed by firing squad in 2015, after longstanding requests from her home country.",
      "Five Australians who spent almost 20 years in Indonesian prisons for heroin trafficking also returned to Australia in the same month under a deal struck between the governments.",
      "Following the recent repatriation of foreign convicts, Jakarta is considering legislating new rules on prisoner amnesty and transfers as part of a wider aim to ease congestion in the country\u2019s overcrowded prisons."

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says El Salvador\u2019s president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States",
      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including violent American criminals now imprisoned in the United States.",
      "President Nayib Bukele \u201chas agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\u201d Rubio said at a signing ceremony for an unrelated civil nuclear agreement with El Salvador's foreign minister.",
      "\"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentence in the United States even though they\u2019re U.S. citizens or legal residents,\u201d Rubio said. He had just met with Bukele at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet Trump administration demands for a major crackdown on immigration amid turmoil in Washington over the status of the government\u2019s main foreign development agency.",
      "He arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to reduce or eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \u201csafe third country\u201d agreement. That would mean the U.S. could deport non-Salvadorean migrants to El Salvador.",
      "Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Rubio said Bukele then went further and said his country was willing to accept and to jail U.S. citizens or legal residents convicted of and imprisoned for violent crimes.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \u201csafe third country\u201d plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington\u2019s \u201cbackyard to dump the garbage.\u201d",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It\u2019s unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\u201cMass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\u201d Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \u201cIt impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d",
      "Monday\u2019s deportation flight came as Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is an effective way to stem the flow of illegal migration, of mass migration, which is destructive and destabilizing,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd it would have been impossible to do without the strong partnership we have here with our friends and allies in Panama. And we\u2019re going to continue to do it.\u201d",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency\u2019s Washington headquarters after billionaire Elon Musk announced Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades \u2014 although its new status will likely be challenged in court \u2014 and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\u201cI understand that it\u2019s a delicate issue in Panama,\u201d Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it\u2019ll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\u201d",
      "But back in Washington, Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China\u2019s involved with the Panama Canal. They won\u2019t be for long and that\u2019s the way it has to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe either want it back, or we\u2019re going to get something very strong, or we\u2019re going to take it back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cAnd China will be dealt with.\u201d",
      "As he has in the past, Trump again criticized the Carter administration for having signed a 1970s treaty to cede control of the canal to Panama and said it was a pact that Panama has since \u201ctotally violated.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve agreed to certain things, but I\u2019m not happy with it,\u201d Trump said.",

    "story": [
      "Maryland officials have unveiled their designs for replacing Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge almost a year after it collapsed under the weight of a cargo ship that lost power and veered off course",
      "SPARROWS POINT, Md. -- Almost a year after the deadly collapse of Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge, Maryland officials on Tuesday unveiled their designs for its replacement, which will be taller and better protected against ship strikes.",
      "Construction of the state\u2019s first cable-stayed bridge could be completed in 2028 and cost upwards of $1.7 billion.",
      "With its graceful outline and delicate design, officials said the new bridge will modernize Baltimore\u2019s skyline, becoming a symbol of resilience, progress and economic growth. The design features two towers with cables radiating down to the deck.",
      "\u201cThis is a great day for the state of Maryland,\u201d Gov. Wes Moore said at a news conference late Tuesday morning. \u201cBut it\u2019s not lost on me that today\u2019s triumph was born out of tragedy.\u201d",
      "The original Key Bridge, a 1.6-mile (2.6-kilometer) steel span at the mouth of Baltimore\u2019s harbor, took five years to construct and opened to traffic in 1977. It connected various port-oriented industrial communities around Baltimore and allowed drivers to easily bypass downtown.",
      "The bridge was destroyed when a massive container ship lost power and slammed into one of its supporting columns. The March 26 collapse killed six construction workers who were filling potholes when the structure crumbled beneath them. Baltimore\u2019s port was closed for months after the collapse, and increased traffic congestion remains a problem for drivers across the region.",
      "Officials quickly promised to rebuild the bridge \u2014 a longstanding Baltimore landmark and vital piece of transportation infrastructure.",
      "Demolition of the remaining pieces will take place this spring, with construction of its replacement to follow, officials said Tuesday.",
      "They held Tuesday\u2019s news conference at Tradepoint Atlantic, a shipping hub in the Port of Baltimore that played a major role in cleanup and recovery efforts following the collapse. The facility is revitalizing the site of a former Bethlehem Steel plant just northeast of Baltimore as maritime shipping continues to fuel the regional economy.",
      "\u201cMaryland is a bridge between America and the rest of the world. We get cars from Michigan out to market. We bring sugars and spices to Louisiana. We haul farm equipment from the East Coast deep into the heartland,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCommerce and trade are the bedrock of our state, and we will continue to make investments that honor our tradition.\u201d",
      "In August, the state awarded a $73 million contract for the first phase of the rebuild to Kiewit Infrastructure, a major construction and engineering firm.",
      "Officials said the project would advance in two phases, with the first focusing on the design work and other necessary steps before construction begins. Moore promised to \u201cemploy many Marylanders\u201d throughout the process.",
      "Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said the design will include the latest in pier protection technology, which has become increasingly important as ships keep getting bigger and carrying more cargo. The bridge will also be taller to provide more clearance. He said the plans were developed with the project\u2019s cost and construction timeline in mind.",
      "\u201cWhile this is a beautiful bridge, it will also be a working bridge for a working city,\u201d Wiedefeld said.",
      "The federal government has agreed to cover the full price tag for rebuilding. Congress recently passed a spending bill that included a funding provision for the project.",
      "Officials have said they expect that federal taxpayers will eventually be made whole through insurance payouts and damages, but that could take a while. A sprawling civil case will ultimately determine the assignments of liability in what could become one of the most expensive maritime disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has not yet released its final report on the collapse, though officials said a loose cable in the ship\u2019s electrical switchboard likely contributed to its power issues. Federal agents boarded the cargo ship Dali amid a criminal investigation last year."

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days. The delay followed negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Late Tuesday, the U.S. Postal Service announced it is temporarily suspending acceptance of inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",
      "Roughly 35% to 40% of PacSun\u2019s garments are made in China, even as the chain has accelerated moves to diversify with suppliers in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "But Olson said Trump's 10% tariff on Chinese goods was less extreme than the company anticipated. For now, PacSun doesn\u2019t plan to increase prices on its products or move its manufacturing of knitwear and denim out of China.",
      "Toys are another category of consumer products that relies heavily on imports from China. Greg Ahearn, the president and CEO of The Toy Association trade group, said he thinks toy companies that source in China are going to absorb the cost of the new tariff in the short term.",
      "Eventually, those price hikes will be moved onto the consumer, Ahearn said.",

      "A Japanese appeals court upheld the conviction of a former American Nissan executive for helping fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn hide income, while rejecting prosecutors\u2019 bid to overturn his acquitals on other counts",
      "TOKYO -- The conviction of a former American Nissan executive for helping fugitive former Chairman Carlos Ghosn hide income was upheld by a Japanese appeals court Tuesday, which also rejected prosecutors' bid to overturn his acquitals on other counts.",
      "Greg Kelly, a lawyer and former executive vice president at Nissan Motor Corp, was convicted in 2022 of charges related to only one of eight years during which prosecutors said he under-reported Ghosn's income. Kelly, who received a 6-month sentence suspended for three years and was allowed to return to Tennessee, did not attend the hearing.",
      "Yoichi Kitamura, Kelly\u2019s attorney, said he will appeal to the Japanese Supreme Court.",
      "Prosecutors, who sought to overturn Kelly\u2019s acquitals for the other seven years, declined to comment. Both sides have 15 days to appeal.",
      "The latest ruling means the six-year battle over the alleged scheme to hide Ghosn\u2019s pay continues.",
      "Ghosn, who became chairman of Nissan after years working in alliance partner Renault, is widely credited with turning around the Japanese carmaker. He was hailed as a business genius until his relationship with the company broke down for reasons that analysts say are related to his foreign management style in an old-fashioned Japanese company.",
      "Prosecutors and the company said that after the board cut his pay by nearly half, he conspired with Kelly and other company officials to secure secret promises of future compensation.",
      "Ghosn and Kelly were arrested in late 2018 in separate but coordinated operations when they returned to Japan for meetings at Nissan.",
      "Ghosn was charged with underreporting his compensation and with breach of trust. He fled to Lebanon while out on bail in December 2019, hiding in a box for musical instruments carried by two Americans who were later extradited from the U.S., found guilty and served nearly two years in Japan.",
      "Ghosn, who says he is innocent, is unlikely to ever stand trial as Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan.",
      "Kelly has repeatedly said he was merely working for Nissan\u2019s interests, and the issue should have been sorted out in a board room, not a courtroom.",
      "Kelly still faces a civil lawsuit filed by Nissan, alleging 4 billion yen ($26 million) in damages. Nissan, based in the port city of Yokohama, south of Tokyo, acknowledged the case is ongoing but declined to comment.",
      "Nissan, having sunk into losses over the last quarter amid drooping sales, is in talks with Japanese rival Honda Motor Co. to integrate their business through a joint holding company.",
      "The Ghosn debacle has long been seen in Japan as a reflection of the difficulties in forging international business alliances.",

      "BEIJING -- China countered President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports Tuesday as well as announcing an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures.",
      "China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\u201cThe US\u2019s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.\u201d",

      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico also were to go into effect Tuesday, though Trump agreed to a 30-day pause on his threats against Mexico and Canada as they acted to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking. Trump planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products.

      "Sri Lanka, which gained independence from Britain in 1948, suffered its worst economic crisis in 2022, forcing the island nation to declare bankruptcy. It also suspended repayments on some $83 billion in domestic and foreign loans amid a foreign exchange crisis that led to a severe shortage of food, medicine, fuel and cooking gas, and hourslong power cuts.",

      "With the price of eggs soaring, more people are looking into keeping backyard chickens",
      "NEW YORK -- Thinking about backyard chickens as egg prices soar? Think hard, especially in light of the bird flu outbreak.",
      "Keeping home chickens as a pastime has continued to grow since the pandemic. But if eggs are the goal, remember that it takes planning and investment to raise the chickens and protect against bird flu. Costs might go well beyond the nationwide average of $4.15 a dozen that commercial eggs sold for in December.",
      "\u201cAnyone who\u2019s done an ounce of research will very quickly understand that there are no free eggs, there are no inexpensive eggs in keeping chickens,\u201d said Kathy Shea Mormino, a home chicken blogger and author who has about 50 of the birds at her Suffield, Connecticut, home.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to pay more, particularly in your first several years, in your set up and in your birds. And there's a huge learning curve on how to care for animals that are really unusual pets,\u201d said Mormino, who has kept chickens for 15 years and calls herself the Chicken Chick.",
      "Costs vary wildly, from about $200 to $2,000 for a coop alone. Feeders and waterers range from about $8 to $50 or more, depending on the size and type.",
      "Bird flu has forced farmers to slaughter millions of chickens a month, contributing (along with inflation) to the steep price of commercial eggs and resulting in some scantily stocked stores around the country. The scarcity and high prices are causing some to look for a backyard alternative.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a real uptick in calls recently from people wanting to start their own backyard flocks. With the egg shortages at grocery stores, many are excited about the idea of raising chickens and taking steps toward sustainability,\u201d said Matthew Aversa, a co-owner of Winding Branch Ranch, a nonprofit sanctuary and farm animal rescue outside San Antonio.",
      "\u201cWe adopt out whole flocks. We're receiving at least a dozen inquiries per week,\u201d he said.",
      "Kate Perz, the animal science coordinator for Cornell Cooperative Extension of Suffolk County, New York, said that unlike other pandemic pastimes, raising home chickens has only grown.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not always cost-effective,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to really look at how many eggs you\u2019re eating and what the cost of those are versus what you would be spending.\u201d",
      "There are other reasons, of course, to keep chickens at home, not the least of which is the sheer joy of their presence. Mormino and other \u201cchickeneers,\u201d as she calls home enthusiasts, have a coop full of tips on how to get started.",
      "You may be ready to dive right in. Your town may not. Mormino, who wrote \u201cThe Chicken Chick's Guide to Backyard Chickens,\u201d said the first thing to consider is whether chickens are right for you. After that, don't assume your county, town or city will allow it.",
      "Look up zoning and building codes yourself if you feel capable. Otherwise, consult an attorney who specializes in municipal law in your area.",
      "Don't rely on word of mouth or even a town worker to know the ins and outs. Is a building permit required to build a coop? Are roosters banned under noise ordinances? Sometimes, zoning codes are silent on the subject. Don't assume that's a green light. Many codes are \u201cpermissive use\" regulations, Mormino said, essentially meaning that if the code doesn't say you're permitted, you're not!",
      "If chicken-keeping is allowed, is there a limit on how many birds? Are there restrictions on where a coop can be built in relation to neighboring property lines. Most homeowners associations have rules on animal keeping.",
      "Mormino lives in a farming town and had a neighbor who kept three horses and a small flock of chickens, so she assumed they were legal. They weren't. She called the town clerk's office to ask whether a building permit was required to build a coop and was told it wasn't. It was.",
      "In the end, she successfully defended a lawsuit against her (she's an attorney) and prevailed in a long battle to amend the law, legalizing backyard chickens in her town.",
      "Bird flu is highly contagious. It spreads mostly by migrating waterfowl in their droppings. Chickens are far from immune if they spend any time free ranging or in a run without protection from wild fowl droppings.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a limited number of things that we can do because our birds live where wildlife live,\u201d Mormino said. \u201cPeople need to know if they have a bird or birds that die suddenly from some of the symptoms, they need to contact the USDA to get the postmortem exam and the birds tested for bird flu.\u201d",
      "Don't bring sick birds into the house for care. That raises the risk of transmission to humans. Once the virus is confirmed, the entire flock needs to be euthanized, she and Perz said.",
      "Symptoms of bird flu include: sudden death without any clinical signs; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles or hocks; diarrhea; stumbling or falling down; decreased egg production and/or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; and coughing and sneezing.",
      "Don't feed any wildlife in areas where your chickens dwell or roam. Wash hands thoroughly after tending to chickens and dedicate a pair of shoes or boots strictly for use around them.",
      "\u201cThe biggest mistake backyard chickeneers make is to bring new chickens into their flock that have lived someplace else. That's the fastest way to bring disease into your chicken yard,\u201d Mormino said.",
      "Sarah Penny has turned her 7,000-square-foot home lot in Knoxville, Tennessee, into a beautiful garden and chicken home. She has nine birds and grows more than half the food she and her 13-year-old son eat.",
      "She's had chickens since 2021 and estimates her startup costs at about $2,500.",
      "Monthly costs vary based on what chickens are fed and how coops are kept. Penny, for instance, uses the deep litter method and composts from her coop, meaning she's not mucking out her coop more than twice a year.",
      "\u201cBut the cost of starting with backyard chickens is definitely quite expensive. I don\u2019t know if a lot of people know that,\u201d Penny said.",

      "U.S. job openings fell in December, a sign that the labor market is cooling but remains healthy",
      "U.S. job openings fell in December, a sign that the labor market is cooling but still healthy.",
      "Openings fell to 7.6 million, from 8.2 million in November, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. They were down from 8.9 million a year earlier and a peak of 12.2 million in March 2022 when the economy was rebounding from COVID-19 lockdowns. The openings fell short of the 7.9 million that economists had expected.",
      "The number of layoffs fell, suggesting that Americans enjoy unusual job security. The number of people quitting their jobs rose modestly but stayed below pre-pandemic levels. After surging in 2021 and 2022, quits have come down as workers lose confidence in their ability to find better pay or working conditions elsewhere.",
      "The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary (JOLTS) showed professional and businesses services companies \u2013 a broad category that includes managers and technical workers \u2014 scaled back their job postings. Openings also fell in healthcare and social assistance and finance and insurance but ticked higher in arts, entertainment and recreation.",
      "The American labor market has slowed from the frenzied hiring of 2021-2023. Employers added 186,000 jobs a month in 2024 through November, not bad but down from 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and a record 604,000 in 2021. When the Labor Department releases its jobs report for January on Friday, it's expected to show that hiring slowed to 160,000 from 256,000, consistent with a healthy but unspectacular job market. Unemployment is expected to stay at a low 4.1%.",
      "Hiring has remained solid despite high interest rates. In 2022 and 2023, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times in an effort to tame inflation. Price pressures have eased considerably, allowing the Fed to reverse course and cut the rate three times in 2024. But the progress on inflation has stalled in recent months and year-over-year increases in consumer prices remain above the central bank's 2% target.",
      "President Donald Trump's plans to tax imports and deport immigrant working in the United States illegally also threaten to rekindle inflation. The Fed has responded with caution, signaling that it expects to cut rates twice this year, down from the four cuts it had projected in September.",
      "\u201cThe December JOLTS report is consistent with the Fed\u2019s view that the labor market is healthy enough to tolerate a more cautious approach to lowering rates, particularly given the uncertainty surrounding tariff policy, said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. She added that the report \"painted a familiar picture of the labor market, with a low pace of layoffs keeping net job growth positive despite a slow pace of hiring.''"

      "NEW YORK -- For Elon Musk fans, it\u2019s the half a trillion-dollar bet.",
      "That is how much the stock market value of Tesla has rocketed since the presidential election, a vertiginous climb uninterrupted in recent days despite a disappointing financial report that would have sunk the stock of nearly any other company.",
      "Investors are wagering that President Donald Trump will help Musk\u2019s company more than hurt it with his plans to take an axe to reams of Washington regulations and wield tariffs to get his way with key trading partners.",
      "Less regulation? Fantastic. Trade war? No biggie.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a golden age for Tesla and Musk,\u201d said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives, adding after an investor conference call Wednesday, \u201cThis is the bullish I\u2019ve ever heard Musk.\u201d",
      "Investing in Tesla has long been a gamble. Odds were against Musk creating a successful electric car company, never mind growing it to become the world\u2019s most valuable automaker \u2013 and in the process making himself the world\u2019s richest man. But this latest bet seems particularly risky.",
      "Musk says the true value of company lays in a future of Tesla robots, thousands of them possibly by the end of the year, and in unsupervised, driverless vehicles. He promised in Tesla's investor conference call to start offering such robotaxis in June in Austin, Texas, and across the country by the end of next year.",
      "Speeding all that along will be Trump, or so the story goes, who has given Musk an office in the White House and made him the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency tasked with shrinking the size of the government.",
      "Trump\u2019s new transportation secretary, who can have a big impact on Tesla, is mostly sticking to the script. Sean Duffy has promised to cut excessive regulation on automakers as well as to come up with a single set of federal rules on self-driving technology to replace a patchwork of state-by-state ones that Musk has blasted for holding back development.",
      "Perhaps more importantly, Trump has softened his stance toward China, a big market for Tesla, hitting the country with an additional 10% tariffs starting Saturday, and not the 60% he threatened on the campaign trail. Still, Trump's decision to impose tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as China, should affect Tesla. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said last week the company should feel an impact to its business because it sources parts from around the globe.",
      "Trump has also vowed to do other things that will hurt Musk\u2019s business.",
      "Tesla sources many of its parts from abroad and so Trump\u2019s decision to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico will hit the company hard if they stick.",
      "Trump also has vowed to eliminate a $7,500 federal tax rebate designed to get people to buy electric vehicles. He\u2019ll also lower emission standards, a potential blow to Tesla\u2019s business of selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to car makers that pollute more and fall short of the requirements. Tesla sold $692 million of these credits i n the last three months of 2024, a 60% jump from a year ago, revenue that nearly all flows straight to Tesla\u2019s bottom line.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear whether the Trump administration will hold off on investigations into Tesla, in particular a technology the company calls Full Self-Driving, a misnomer because the vehicles could require human intervention at any moment. In October, the transportation department\u2019s auto safety regulator, the National Traffic Highway Safety Administration, launched the latest of several probes into the technology after getting reports of crashes in low-visibility conditions, including one that killed a pedestrian.",
      "Transportation Secretary Duffy promised senators at a hearing earlier this month that he would let the Tesla investigations follow the facts \u2014 specifically vowing to buck any political pressure to go easy on the self-described \u201cfirst buddy\u201d of the president.",
      "Musk will need all the regulatory relief and other goodies from Trump that he can get.",
      "In early January, Tesla said sales dropped in 2024, a first in more than a dozen years, as rivals such as BMW, Volkswagen and China\u2019s BYD come out with competitive EVs and steal market share.",
      "Then on Wednesday, Tesla reported revenue, profits and other key measures of financial health for the last quarter of 2024 all fell short of what analysts had expected. The stock climbed higher anyway.",
      "\u201cThings that would hurt other automakers,\u201c marvels Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein, \u201ddon\u2019t seem to impact Tesla.\u201d",
      "Besides the business, Tesla shareholders must always keep one eye on the CEO himself. Lately, that\u2019s meant weighing Musk\u2019s foray into politics.",
      "In Europe, a major market for his cars, Musk has endorsed the far-right Alternative for Germany and called British Prime Minister Keir Starmer an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who is running a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "On Inauguration Day in the U.S., Musk made a straight-arm gesture during a speech that many interpreted as Nazi salute. He scoffed at the criticism, but the backlash was fierce nonetheless. In Germany, an image of Musk making the salute was projected onto his massive Tesla factory outside Berlin in protest. In Italy, a communist youth group hung an effigy of Musk upside down in the same square in Milan where the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini was strung upside down, too.",
      "\u201cHow many of these Tesla buyers agree with Musk?\u201d said Felipe Munoz, a senior analyst at auto researcher Jato Dynamics. \u201cI don\u2019t see the point of alienating potential customers.\u201d",
      "Musk also risks turning off regulators in Europe, who he hopes will soon approve the use of Full Self-Driving there.",
      "If investors start losing faith in Musk, it\u2019s a long way down.",
      "The run-up in Tesla stock alone since the election amounts to more than the annual economic output of 160 countries. Tesla\u2019s total market value has grown to about $1.3 trillion, more than the worth of General Motors, BMW, Ford, Ferrari, Porsche and a dozen other top car makers combined.",

      "Wedbush's Ives, the \u201cgolden age\u201d analyst, agrees the stock can only go up from here.",

      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said he is also banning American companies from provincial contracts, signed a $100-million Canadian (US$68 million) with Musk's company in November to deliver high-speed internet to remote residents in rural and northern Ontario.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be ripping up the province\u2019s contract with Starlink. Ontario won\u2019t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy,\u201d Ford said.",

      "Ford said U.S.-based businesses will lose out on \u201ctens of billions of dollars\u201d in new revenues as a result of Ontario\u2019s response.",
      "\u201cWe just aren't going to be using American companies,\u201d Ford said. \u201cAnd no matter if we are building a hospital, if we're building anything, if we're building a dog house I want to make sure we are using Ontario steel, Canadian products, Canadian wood, Ontario wood, anything.",
      "\"I don't care if it's a toothpick. We need to purchase from Canada and Ontario.\u201d",
      "Ontario and other provinces already planned to remove American liquor brands from government store shelves. The Liquor Control Board of Ontario sells nearly $1 billion worth of American wine, beer, spirits and seltzers every year, Ford pointed.",
      "\u201cCanada didn\u2019t start this fight with the U.S., but you better believe we\u2019re ready to win it,\u201d said Ford, who called an election for his province last week.",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump says he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a massive human rights violation",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump said he will cut all funding to South Africa over what he called a human rights violation, a move that reflects Elon Musk's repeated and false claims over the years that authorities in his country of birth are anti-white and even encouraging the killing of white people.",
      "Trump said on Sunday that \u201cterrible things are happening in South Africa. The leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things\u201d without providing specifics. He said \u201cthey're taking away land, they're confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that are perhaps far worse than that.\u201d",
      "While it wasn't clear exactly what Trump was referring to, he appeared to be referencing a new law in South Africa that gives the government powers in some instances to expropriate land from people.",
      "Musk, a close Trump ally and head of Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, has highlighted that law in recent social media posts and cast it as a threat to South Africa's white minority.",
      "Many South Africans viewed Trump's sudden pledge to punish America's biggest trade partner in Africa as surprising and at least partly influenced by billionaire Tesla owner Musk, who was born in the South African capital of Pretoria but left for Canada after he completed high school.",
      "The Expropriation Act was signed into law by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa last month and allows the government to take land in specific instances where it is not being used, or where it would be in the public interest if it is redistributed.",
      "It aims to address some of the wrongs of South Africa's racist apartheid era, when Black people had land taken away from them and were forced to live in areas designated for non-whites.",
      "Ramaphosa responded to Trump's comments Monday by saying the U.S. president was wrong and no land had been confiscated, and said he looked forward to \"engaging\" with the Trump administration over the issue. The South African government said that the U.S. didn't understand the law.",
      "Musk accused Ramaphosa's government in 2023 of allowing a \u201cgenocide\u201d to happen over the killings of some white farmers, which have happened for years.",
      "While the killings have been condemned, experts have said there is no evidence of any genocide and they are part of South Africa's extremely high violent crime rates and mostly related to farm robberies. Crime affects all South Africans, and the country has an average of 70 homicides a day, with the vast majority of the victims Black.",
      "Musk also waded into the issue Monday by replying to a post by Ramaphosa's official account on X with the question: \u201cWhy do you have openly racist ownership laws?\u201d",
      "Again, it remains unclear exactly what Musk was referring to, but his comments seemed to allude to South Africa's affirmative action laws in business that are designed to advance opportunities for Blacks and other racial groups who were disadvantaged under apartheid. Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has been denied a license in South Africa because it doesn't meet affirmative action criteria.",
      "More than 30 years after the end of the apartheid system of white minority rule, white people in South Africa generally still have a much higher standard of living than Black people.",
      "That's reflected in poverty statistics, with a 2021 study by the South African Human Rights Commission finding that 64% of Black people were living in poverty against 1% of white people. When it comes to land, white people make up about 7% of the population of 62 million and own around 70% of land, according to the most recent land audit, although that share has decreased since apartheid.",
      "Still, the new land law has drawn criticism even from inside the country, with civic groups that represent the interests of whites and some South African political parties saying they will challenge it in court because it allows land to be taken without compensation in some cases.",
      "While South Africa has deep socioeconomic problems and a damaging legacy from nearly a half-century of apartheid, it is regarded as a stable democracy and is not a country brimming with racial tensions as it is sometimes portrayed to be.",
      "Trump said on his Truth Social platform that South Africa was \u201ctreating certain classes of people VERY BADLY,\u201d again without elaborating, and he would stop all future funding while the U.S. investigated.",
      "That threatens around $400 million a year in aid the U.S. gives to South Africa, most of it for the country's HIV/AIDS program through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR. South Africa's U.S. funding through PEPFAR was already threatened by Trump's global aid freeze.",
      "South Africa was also concerned that Trump might remove it from the AGOA trade agreement, which gives South Africa and other African nations tariff-free access to the U.S. market. Trump has already imposed tariffs on goods from China, Canada and Mexico \u2014 although on Monday he said he is pausing his tariffs planned for Mexico by one month.",

      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "MADRID -- Spain men's coach Luis de la Fuente told a judge in the Luis Rubiales trial on Tuesday that he did not get involved in discussions related to Jenni Hermoso following her World Cup kiss from the former Spanish soccer boss.",
      "Rubiales is accused of sexual assault for kissing Hermoso, the Spain forward, at the 2023 Women's World Cup final presentation ceremony in Sydney, as well as of coercion for allegedly trying to convince the player to support his version of the kiss. Hermoso says she did not consent to the kiss while Rubiales says it was consensual.",
      "De la Fuente said during his brief appearance in court that he spoke with Hermoso only about two months ago at a gala. He was at the Women's World Cup final in Australia but said he did not have any discussions with Spanish federation officials about the kiss and alleged attempts to support Rubiales.",
      "The 47-year-old Rubiales and three other former federation officials \u2014 former Spain women\u2019s coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of the Spain men\u2019s team Albert Luque, and former head of marketing Rub\u00e9n Rivera \u2014 are accused of pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.",
      "\u201cNobody talked to me or asked me about\u201d a possible statement, De la Fuente said.",
      "The coach said that when he visited the federation in the days following the scandal, he only \u201ctalked about football\u201d and business related to his position as the men's national coach.",
      "De La Fuente last week had his contract with the men's national team extended to 2028.",
      "The judge got angry at one point on Tuesday with the testimony of former federation press chief Pablo Garc\u00eda Cuervo, asking him to be more clear with his answers.",
      "Cuervo said he wrote up some of Hermoso's comments to a local radio station to release them to the media. He said Hermoso asked if they wanted her to do a video with the comments, and he said that it was not necessary.",
      "Hermoso testified on the first day of the trial on Monday and said she \u201cfelt disrespected\u201d by Rubiales after winning the Women's World Cup final and the kiss \u201cstained one of the happiest days of my life.\u201d",
      "The kiss sparked outrage in Spain about the prevalence of sexism in sports and beyond.",
      "Rubiales has yet to testify and denied the charges. He resigned under pressure three weeks later and was banned by FIFA for three years. Rubiales had said he was the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by \u201cfalse feminists.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors, Hermoso and the Spain players\u2019 association want Rubiales jailed for two and a half years, fined 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and banned from working as a sports official. They want the other three defendants sentenced to one and a half years in prison.",
      "The trial will continue on Wednesday. It is expected to last at least 10 days. Rubiales attended the first day on Monday.",

But I\u2019m terrible at sports. I mean, it\u2019s weird to say, but I\u2019m terrible. I mean, I\u2019m pretty good in some, like when it\u2019s a gliding sport, like when I can ride on something then it\u2019s good.\u201d",

      "Kelce had a throwback game in the divisional round win over Houston with seven catches for 117 yards and enters the Super Bowl with the most catches ever in the playoffs (174) and second to Hall of Famer Jerry Rice in yards receiving (2,039) and TD catches (20).",
      "Kelce was one of the most popular players with the media during opening night with a large group of reporters and others surrounding his podium for the entire hour, peppering him with questions on all sorts of topics from football to dances to whether he planned to give Swift a ring if the Chiefs win on Sunday. He quickly responded, \u201cA Super Bowl ring? Next question.\u201d",
      "Kelce did say his relationship with Swift helps him on the football field by providing motivation that he needs to work as hard as she does to remain at the top of his game.",

      "No. 16 Kansas turned up the defense and shut down eighth-ranked Iowa State in a 69-52 victory that helped to keep the Jayhawks in the Big 12 title race",
      "LAWRENCE, Kan. -- Kansas had just turned the ball over in the first half against Iowa State on Monday night when it suddenly popped loose again along the sideline, and Jayhawks guard Dajuan Harris Jr. made perhaps the hustle play of the game.",
      "With a textbook baseball slide, Harris managed to corral the ball and throw it from his rear to teammate Hunter Dickinson, who in turn tossed the ball ahead to David Coit. After a couple of dribbles, Coit unloaded a pass from the midcourt line that KJ Adams leaped into the air and slammed for a dunk that seemed to shake the rafters of Allen Fieldhouse.",
      "It was a play that underscored a rare fact about the Jayhawks at this point in the season.",
      "They were playing with a sense of desperation.",
      "Zeke Mayo scored 17 points and Dickinson added 14 points and nine rebounds as the No. 16 Jayhawks roared to a 69-52 win over eighth-ranked Iowa State. But it was the defense, which nearly shut down the Cyclones' prolific backcourt, and the hustle on both ends of the floor that allowed Kansas to remain in the regular-season Big 12 title hunt.",
      "Kansas (16-6) moved into a tie with Iowa State (17-5) at 7-4 in the league, 2 1/2 games back of Houston and Arizona.",
      "\u201cWe talked about a mindset of just, you know, how much can we trust each other? And how much do we enjoy playing with each other?\u201d Jayhawks coach Bill Self said. \u201cI don't think the emphasis was defense. I think the emphasis was, \u2018If our head is right and we play with freedom, we can look pretty good at times,\u2019 and that is what happened tonight.\u201d",
      "The Jayhawks held Iowa State to just 3-for-21 shooting from beyond the 3-point arc. And while the Cyclones only turned the ball over seven times, just about all of them \u2014 like that alley-oop dunk by Adams \u2014 turned into fast-break points.",
      "\u201cThere's probably not a place or a team or a program that does a better job than what Kansas does in transition,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger said. \u201cIf you have a turnover and how they turn it into points \u2014 we had very few turnovers but you feel like every one that we had turned into a layup or a dunk at the other end.\u201d",
      "While the Jayhawks, who blew a 19-point halftime lead at Baylor last weekend, thrived with their backs against the wall, Iowa State lost its third consecutive game while struggling without injured forward Milan Momcilovic in the lineup.",
      "Momcilovic, who hurt his non-shooting hand last month, went through pregame warmups and could be back soon.",
      "\u201cHe continues to do the things he needs,\u201d Otzelberger said. \u201cI do think he\u2019ll be back in the next few weeks. But it's a day-to-day situation. Today was the first step for him, feel what it feels like to go through the game warmup. But we\u2019ll see. I don't want to rush him back. I want it to be on the timeline that's on his best interest and whenever that is he'll be ready to go.\u201d",
      "Tamin Lipsey, Keshon Gilbert and Joshua Jefferson were held to 11 points apiece by Kansas, and it took a whole lot of shots for them to get there. The trio of Cyclones was 13 of 42 from the field and 2 of 14 from beyond the 3-point arc.",
      "Meanwhile, leading scorer Curtis Jones was held to seven points on 3-for-11 shooting.",
      "\u201cIt sucks for sure. Losing is not ideal,\u201d Jones said, \u201cbut I mean, we did some things well. We got 17 offensive rebounds, only had seven turnovers. It's just really shots weren't falling. We clean up free throws, make a couple 3s, it's a different game.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG -- China on Tuesday announced a flurry of retaliatory measures against the U.S., including tariffs on imports of products such as coal, liquefied natural gas products and crude oil, as well as an antitrust probe into Google. It also placed two other U.S. firms on an unreliable entity list that could bar them from investing in China.",
      "China and Google have had a long and entangled relationship going back to the early 2000s.",
      "Here's a look at Google's history in China and what the antitrust probe means for the company:",
      "Google launched Chinese-language search engine google.cn in 2006. It was censored to comply with Beijing\u2019s laws, and in 2009, was a major search engine in China with about 36% market share.",
      "In 2010, in response to a cyberattack and an increasing unwillingness to comply with censorship rules, Google said it was no longer willing to block search results and shut down its Chinese search engine, redirecting users to its Hong Kong site instead.",
      "Beijing later blocked Google services under its Great Firewall censorship system, including its email service Gmail, as well as its Chrome browser and search engine, making it inaccessible to users in mainland China.",
      "China typically blocks most Western internet platforms, such as Google, as well as social media platforms including Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Although Google services are not accessible in China, the company still maintains a presence in the country, primarily focused on sales and engineering for its advertising business. It also has employees working on services including Google Cloud and customer solutions.",
      "Google maintains offices in the major Chinese cities Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.",
      "China\u2019s State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it was investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws.",
      "While regulators did not provide further details, the announcement came minutes after the 10% tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump came into effect.",
      "As there are few details on what exactly Google is being investigated for, the immediate impact on Google operations is unclear, although its current status is unlikely to be affected by the probe, which could takes months.",
      "Google did not immediately comment on the investigation.",
      "Some experts believe that the antitrust investigation is likely to center around Google\u2019s Android operating system for smartphones and used as a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "John Gong, a professor of economics at the University of International Business and Economics, said that the investigation could be related to Google\u2019s dominance in the Android business, as virtually all smartphone brands apart from Apple and Huawei would have to pay licensing fees to Google to use the Android system on their devices.",
      "\u201cNow, this time, Google is put on the chopping board. But I think it\u2019s still an investigation, right? It hasn\u2019t reached a decision yet,\u201d said Gong, adding, \"I think it\u2019s very much negotiable.\u201d",
      "Huawei developed its own HarmonyOS operating system after it was placed on the U.S. entity list \u2014 foreign individuals, companies and organizations deemed a national security concern \u2014 in 2019, which prevented it from doing business with U.S. firms including Google.",
      "Google has been accused of violating antitrust law in other countries, including those in the European Union, South Korea, Russia, India and Turkey, for allegedly abusing its market dominance.",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Elon Musk's lawyers faced off with OpenAI in court Tuesday as a federal judge weighed the billionaire's request for a court order that would block the ChatGPT maker from converting itself to a for-profit company.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn't intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its transition from a nonprofit research laboratory to a for-profit corporation.",
      "But the judge also raised concerns about OpenAI and its relationship with business partner Microsoft and said she wouldn't stop the case from moving to trial as soon as next year so a jury can decide.",
      "\u201cIt is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true. We\u2019ll find out. He\u2019ll sit on the stand,\u201d she said.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good. Musk had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday.",
      "Musk escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff.",
      "Also targeted by Musk's lawsuit is OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft and tech entrepreneur Reid Hoffman, a former OpenAI board member who also sits on Microsoft's board.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said she has a high bar for approving the kind of preliminary injunction that Musk wants but hasn't yet ruled on the request.",
      "She has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple's fight with Epic Games, though she said Tuesday that Musk's case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one. Then-President Barack Obama appointed her to the federal bench in 2011.",
      "Tuesday's hearing was originally set for January but was postponed after Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said his house was destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire.",
      "Musk, who did not attend the hearing, has alleged in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI has said Musk\u2019s requested court order would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "He had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI has sought to demonstrate Musk\u2019s early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "Musk is not the only one challenging OpenAI's for-profit transition. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has asked California's attorney general to block it, and the office of Delaware's attorney general has said it is reviewing the conversion.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- New research shows that when an asteroid slammed into the moon billions of years ago, it carved out a pair of grand canyons on the lunar far side.",
      "That's good news for scientists and NASA, which is looking to land astronauts at the south pole on the near, Earth-facing side untouched by that impact and containing older rocks in original condition.",
      "U.S. and British scientists used photos and data from NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to map the area and calculate the path of debris that produced these canyons about 3.8 billion years ago. They reported their findings Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The incoming space rock passed over the lunar south pole before hitting, creating a huge basin and sending streams of boulders hurtling at a speed of nearly 1 mile a second (1 kilometer a second). The debris landed like missiles, digging out two canyons comparable in size to Arizona's Grand Canyon in barely 10 minutes. The latter, by comparison, took millions of years to form.",
      "\u201cThis was a very violent, a very dramatic geologic process,\u201d said lead author David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.",
      "Kring and his team estimate the asteroid was 15 miles (25 kilometers) across and that the energy needed to create these two canyons would have been more than 130 times that in the world\u2019s current inventory of nuclear weapons.",
      "Most of the ejected debris was thrown in a direction away from the south pole, Kring said.",
      "That means NASA\u2019s targeted exploration zone around the pole mostly on the moon's near side won\u2019t be buried under debris, keeping older rocks from 4 billion plus years ago exposed for collection by moonwalkers. These older rocks can help shed light not only on the moon\u2019s origins, but also Earth\u2019s.",

      "It sparked \u201ca mad scramble right now\u201d to grab copies of whatever federal data was posted before, O'Hara said.",
      "While the administration's stated goal was to delete gender and transgender terminology, O'Hara said some researchers worry that other politically charged topics \u2014 such as climate change or vaccines \u2014 might be removed or altered.",
      "A expert panel affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention demanded a meeting on the deletions.",
      "The committee, chartered by Congress to advise the CDC director, asked the agency's acting director, Susan Monarez, for an explanation about why it had cut off access to datasets \u201cthat allow people across the country to understand the health of their communities.\u201d",
      "The panel had yet to receive a response, said committee member Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former federal health official who is now a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "Experts say datasets and summaries were affected, but so too were codebooks that explain different variables. They say they also saw changes to published research that used affected datasets, and even redactions to lists of publications about certain topics.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is quite stunning,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "Researchers are still stumbling on what was taken down or changed, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are finding out about omissions when somebody goes searching for it,\u201d O'Hara said.",
      "On Monday, for instance, when a query was made to access certain data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s most comprehensive survey of American life, users got a response that said the area was \u201cunavailable due to maintenance.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s official public portal for health data, data.cdc.gov, was taken down entirely on Friday but went back up over the weekend, albeit with a yellow ribbon at the top saying: \u201cCDC\u2019s website is being modified to comply with President Trump\u2019s Executive Orders.\u201d The agency's Youth Risk Behavior Survey data was restored too, but with at least one of the gender columns missing and its data documentation removed.",
      "CDC officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. statistical system is considered the best in the world and researchers fear that the removals will undermine trust and put the integrity of the data at risk.",
      "\u201cThis sets a really dangerous precedent that any administration can come in and delete whatever they don\u2019t like,\u201d said Beth Jarosz, a senior program director at the Population Reference Bureau. \u201cRegardless of your politics, this should alarm you since this is taxpayer-funded data and it belongs to the public.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the presidents of the Population Association of America and the Association of Population Centers called the takedowns \u201cunacceptable\u201d and called on Congress and the Trump administration to restore the datasets.",
      "Paul Schroeder, executive director of the Council of Professional Associations on Federal Statistics, said people looking for data may have to resort to suing for access or submitting Freedom of Information Act requests for the datasets.",
      "\u201cThe removal of several public datasets from agency websites goes against everything the statistical agencies stand for and were intended for,\u201d Schroeder said Monday. \u201cPublic data users are being left in the dark about what is going on.\u201d",

      "Japan has launched a navigation satellite on its flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a precise positioning system of its own",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's space agency said on Sunday it successfully launched a navigation satellite on its new flagship H3 rocket as the country seeks to have a more precise location positioning system of its own.",
      "The H3 rocket carrying the Michibiki 6 satellite lifted off from the Tanegashima Space Center on a southwestern Japanese island.",
      "Everything went smoothly and the satellite successfully separated from the rocket as planned about 29 minutes after the liftoff, said Makoto Arita, H3 project manager for the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, or JAXA.",
      "Officials said it is expected to reach its targeted geospatial orbit in about two weeks.",
      "Japan currently has the quasi-zenith satellite system, or QZSS, with four satellites for a regional navigation system that first went into operation in 2018. The Michibiki 6 will be the fifth of its network.",
      "Michibiki\u2019s signals are used to supplement American GPS and will further improve positioning data for smartphones, car and maritime navigation and drones.",
      "Japan plans to launch two more navigation satellites to have a seven-satellite system by March 2026 in order to have a more precise global positioning capability without relying on foreign services, including the U.S., according to the Japan Science and Technology Agency. By the late 2030s, Japan plans to have an 11-satellite network.",
      "Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, noting the successful launch in a statement later Sunday, promised that his government will make further effort to \u201cmaximize\u201d the use of the navigation satellite system so that more people can smoothly access positioning data.",
      "Sunday's launch, delayed by a day due to the weather, was the fourth consecutive successful flight for the H3 system after a shocking failed debut attempt last year when the rocket had to be destroyed with its payload.",
      "Japan sees a stable, commercially competitive space transport capability as key to its space program and national security and has been developing two new flagship rockets as successors to the mainstay H2A series \u2014 the larger H3 with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and a much smaller Epsilon system with the aerospace unit of the heavy machinery maker IHI. It hopes to cater to diverse customer needs and improve its position in the growing satellite launch market."

      "Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury\u2019s verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbeha...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Google went to appeals court Monday in an attempt to convince a three-judge panel to overturn a jury's verdict declaring its app store for Android smartphones as an illegal monopoly and block the penalties imposed by a federal judge to stop the misbehavior. Video game maker Epic Games, which brought the case alleging Google's Play Store has been abusing its stranglehold over the Android app market, countered with arguments outlining why both the verdict and punishment should be affirmed to foster more innovation and lower prices.",
      "In a nearly hour-long presentation in San Francisco's Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Google lawyer Jessica Ellsworth explained why the company believes the judge overseeing a month-long trial in 2023 improperly allowed the market in its case to be defined differently than it had in a similar antitrust trial revolving around Apple's antitrust trial in 2021.",
      "Ellsworth also asserted the trial shouldn't have been decided by a jury in the first place because Google exercised its consent to that process and demanded the case be decided by a judge instead, as had the trial by Apple.",
      "Epic, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, filed separate antitrust cases against Apple and Google on the same day in August 2020 and culminated in dramatically different outcomes. Unlike the jury in Google's trial in San Francisco, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers largely sided with Apple in an 185-decision that defined the Play Store and Apple's iPhone app store as part of a broader competitive market.",
      "Ellsworth told the appeals court that U.S. District Judge James Donato improperly allowed Epic to turn the Google trial into a \u201cdo-over\u201d that excluded the Apple app store as a rival in the market definition that led to the jury's verdict in its case.",
      "\"You can't just lose an issue that was fully litigated the first time (in the Apple case) and then pretend it didn't happen,\" Ellsworth said. She said the competition that Google and Apple engage in while making the two operating systems that power virtually all of the world's smartphones \u201csufficiently disciplines\u201d their actions in the app market.",
      "But the appeals judges indicated they believed the market definitions could differ in the separate app store cases because Apple bundles all its software and the iPhone together \u2014 creating what has become known as a \u201cwalled garden\u201d \u2014 while Google licenses the Android software that includes its Play Store a wide variety of smartphone makers.",
      "\u201cThere are clearly some factual differences between the Android world and Apple world,\u201d Judge Danielle J. Forrest told Ellsworth.",
      "Judge Gabriel Sanchez also sounded skeptical about Google's claims about being lumped with an improper market definition in its trial.",
      "\u201cEven if Google vigorously competes with Apple (in smartphone operating systems), that doesn't mean it can't create a different ecosystem where it's a monopolist,\u201d Sanchez interjected during Ellsworth's presentation.",
      "Epic attorney Gary Bornstein painted Google's arguments as a desperate and unfounded effort to preserve the system that boosts Google's profits with price-gouging commissions ranging from 15% to 30% on in-app purchases flowing from software downloaded through the Play Store.",
      "The penalties that Donato imposed in October and subsequently postponed while Google pursues its appeal would impose a series of sweeping changes that include making the Play Store's entire library of 2 million apps available to potential competitors \u2014 a move expected to result in lower commission rates.",
      "The appeals court hasn't set a timeline for issuing a ruling in the Play Store case, but it typically takes several months before a decision is reached.",
      "Google is also currently facing other potential penalties that could include being forced to sell its Chrome web browser after a judge in another antitrust trial ruled its ubiquitous search engine is an illegal monopoly, too.",
      "In Monday's two-hour hearing Bornstein contended that Google never tried to define the Android app market during the trial the way it presented it during its appeal and reminded the three-judge panel that the bar should be set high before reversing a jury's verdict and the ensuing punishment ordered by a lower court judge.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of the doubt does not go to the wrongdoer,\u201d Bornstein said.",
      "The judges seemed more troubled by Donato's decision to stick with a jury trial after the case changed shortly before the Epic trial when Google settled lawsuits brought by attorneys general across the U.S. and another prominent app developer, Match Group. An agreement for a jury trial had been reached when the attorneys general and Match cases were going to be combined with Epic's, but Google wanted to revert to having a judge decide the outcome after settling some of the claims only to be rebuffed by Donato.",
      "At one point during Bornstein's presentation, Forrest openly mused about the possibility of declaring the verdict as a decision rendered by the equivalent of an advisory jury and sending the case back to Donato for a more lengthy ruling.",
      "That is an approach favored by Ellsworth, who pointed out that the judge's ruling in the Apple app store case spanned nearly 200 pages while the jury in the Google trial \u201cwere asked eight questions and they offered 14 words defining a relevant market.\u201d",
      "But Bornstein urged the appeals court to resort to giving Donato a \u201chomework assignment\u201d that would give Google more time to profit from its illegal conduct.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:14:26 -0500",
    "summary": "America&rsquo;s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s national bird, the bald eagle, is having a moment",
      "WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- Along the long road from American icon to endangered species and back again, the bald eagle \u2014 the national bird of the United States, often seen against a clear blue sky \u2014 is having a moment.",
      "The eagles find themselves in an environmental updraft of sorts since the early 2000's, when the federal government took the thriving birds off its endangered species list with more states following suit. Culturally, too, the animals are soaring.",
      "In December, Joe Biden signed legislation making the raptor the country's national bird (thought that was already the case? More in a bit). This month, New Jersey became the latest state to delist the bald eagle as endangered, citing a remarkable comeback for the creatures associated with strength and independence \u2014 and that occupied just a single nest in the state decades ago. And to the chagrin or elation of football fans, the Philadelphia Eagles will be vying for a championship in the Super Bowl this weekend.",
      "How did the storied birds find their way back? As with so many tales, it's complex.",
      "The story \u2014 there was a single nesting pair in New Jersey in the 1980s and roughly 300 now, for instance \u2014 centers on the banning of DDT, a chemical insecticide with environmental side effects that included thin-shelled eagle eggs. That touched off a cratering in the number of eagles across the country, and officials prohibited the pesticide in 1972.",
      "To rebuild the birds' numbers in their historic range across the country, conservationists imported birds from places where their populations were stable, including from Canada. Early on, they also removed eggs from nesting birds' nests, replacing them with artificial ones for the eagles to \u201cincubate\u201d while the real eggs were safely hatched outside the nest before being returned, as eaglets for their parents to raise according to Kathy Clark, the head of New Jersey's Endangered and Nongame Species Program.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re one of the few conservation success stories of animals that almost went extinct on our continent. And so I think now it\u2019s really important to make sure people know that story and learn from it,\u201d said Maia Edwards, the science director at the American Bald Eagle Foundation in Alaska.",
      "Clark, whose work with the birds spans decades and includes the period when their numbers were so small they lived only in a remote part of the state, said the eagles have taught officials a number of lessons. One is that they're \u201cfairly adaptable\" and now live across densely populated (with people) New Jersey \u2014 from suburban Bergen County near New York to the wetlands along the shore in the south.",
      "She recalled the story of one fledgling eagle in a suburban town \u2014 New York Giants territory, as it were, sorry, Eagles fans \u2014 that found itself on a backyard woodpile and walking around the street. Volunteer observers worried over the bird's well-being, given the realities of suburban living. But a year later, observers spotted the eagle, identified by a band. It had apparently made it.",
      "\u201cThose birds that, you know, have that tolerance to live like in such a densely human structured environment is something I have a hard time understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cThey're Jersey birds. You got to have attitude, right?\u201d",
      "The birds do face dangers as they expand into suburbia, though. Jilian Fazio, director of the Essex County Turtle Back Zoo in suburban northern New Jersey, said the zoo rescues a number of birds hit by cars. One bird, a male named Freedom, perched atop a branch in his enclosure at the zoo recently and called out loudly. He was found dangling by a rope, left with an injury that renders him unreleasable, Fazio said.",
      "There are threats, as well. Habitat preservation and clean, open water, since the eagles feed heavily on fish, is a worry, but there's also the current outbreak of avian influenza or bird flu. Clark says officials are going to maintain surveillance amid the outbreak.",
      "Beyond the birds coming off endangered lists, they made headlines recently for finally getting their due as the county's national bird, an oversight left undone in law because the bald eagle was already on the national seal and many thought it already had that status, said Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who sponsored legislation that Biden signed last month.",
      "She and colleagues worked with Native American and veterans groups to get buy-in for the legislation, she said, and it passed the typically divisive House and Senate last year with no dissent. The birds are revered in a number of Native American cultures as symbols of strength, particularly in the Pacific Northwest, according to Paul Apodaca, a retired academic who specializes in folklore and mythology.",
      "The eagles' perch as symbols of the country contributes to their conservation, with experts considering them an \u201cumbrella species,\u201d whose need for large open spaces and waterways helps preserve lesser known wildlife.",
      "\u201cAmericans are always going to have that sort of personal relationship with bald eagles,\" Clark said.",
      "Experiencing seeing a bird in the wild or even as you're driving along a business-lined highway can leave an impression. Dan Day, a birder who's spotted bald eagles some 50 times in recent years both on nature walks and just driving around suburban New Jersey, remembered never having seen the birds as a kid growing up in Cleveland. Now a New Jersey resident and Philadelphia Eagles fan, he regularly goes out in his green \u201cBirds\u201d cap and binoculars.",
      "\u201cJust the mere thrill of seeing one \u2014 a lot of people just have never, ever looked at one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really elevates your day to see a bald eagle.\u201d",
      "Enjoy watching them, experts say, but give them space, too. Because rescuing animals threatened with extinction is expensive, uncertain work. Said Clark, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection official: \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever will lose that perspective of, of being on the brink there, not knowing if if you\u2019re going to be able to save the species.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 08:00:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States dropped dramatically this year even as federal officials move to extend protections for the beloved pollinator",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 Celsius) and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.2 degrees Celsius) are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51.1 degrees Celsius) on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \u201cBut we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres (1,779 hectares) in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs.",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

      "Samoa\u2019s top health official has denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Samoa\u2019s top health official on Monday denounced as \u201ca complete lie\u201d remarks that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made during his bid to become U.S. health secretary, rejecting his claim that some who died in the country's 2019 measles epidemic didn't have the disease.",
      "\"We don\u2019t know what was killing them,\" Kennedy said during tense U.S. Senate hearings last week on whether he should oversee the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, suggesting that the cause of the 83 deaths \u2014 mostly of children under age 5 \u2014 was unclear.",
      "\"It's a total fabrication,\u201d Samoa Director-General of Health Dr. Alec Ekeroma told The Associated Press of Kennedy's comments.",
      "U.S. senators grilled Kennedy last week over his 2019 Samoa trip, accusing him of downplaying his role in the epidemic.",
      "The outbreak devastated the Pacific island nation in 2019, killing 83 people in a population of 200,000. Vaccination rates were historically low because of poor public health management and the 2018 deaths of two babies whose vaccines were incorrectly prepared, prompting fears that the MMR immunization was unsafe before the nature of the error was discovered.",
      "The government suspended vaccinations for 10 months before the outbreak \u2014 the period when Kennedy visited. His trip was organized by a Samoan anti-vaccine influencer, according to a 2021 blog post by Kennedy.",
      "On Wednesday, Kennedy denied that his visit had fueled anti-vaccine sentiment. A spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnti-vaxxers from New Zealand came to be with him here,\u201d Ekeroma said. \u201cThat's how I know that his influence can be far-reaching.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen the tissue samples were sent to New Zealand, most of those people did not have measles,\u201d Kennedy told U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Ekeroma, a medical doctor who also holds a doctorate in health, said that the claim was a \u201chuge denial\u201d of the fact that doctors from several countries traveled to Samoa to treat measles patients.",
      "The Samoan official wasn't the health chief during the outbreak, but confirmed key details with his predecessor, he said. Only one autopsy was carried out and no postmortem tissue samples were sent abroad, which was not unusual because measles is a simple disease to diagnose, said Ekeroma.",
      "Blood samples from living patients were sent to Australia and New Zealand, where the public health agency said Monday that testing had confirmed the same strain of measles circulating in New Zealand at the time.",
      "\u201cI went there \u2013 nothing to do with vaccines,\u201d Kennedy said Wednesday. \u201cI went there to introduce a medical informatics system that would digitalize records in Samoa and make health delivery much more efficient.\u201d",
      "Ekeroma rejected that assertion, referring to social media posts by anti-vaccine advocates who posed for photos with Kennedy during his trip. One later wrote on the blog of Kennedy's then nonprofit, Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 which has decried MMR vaccines as unsafe \u2014 that during the outbreak he received advice from people assembled by Kennedy encouraging the alternative treatments he was supplying to Samoan families.",
      "In the same blog post, Kennedy recalled meeting Samoa's then prime minister, who he said was \u201ccurious to measure health outcomes following the \u2018natural experiment\u2019 created by the national respite from vaccines.\u201d",
      "In late 2019, Kennedy wrote to the leader, saying that the deaths could have been caused by a measles vaccine \u2014 statements he repeated in written responses to senators' questions following the hearing. He urged the Samoan leader to approach a particular laboratory to investigate the source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMy words had nothing to do with vaccine uptake in Samoa or with the 2019 epidemic,\u201d Kennedy said in his written responses.",
      "But Kennedy emboldened anti-vaccine contacts in Samoa, Ekeroma said, and the epidemic was fueled by disinformation in social media posts in the island nation and abroad.",
      "Moelagi Leilani Jackson, a Samoan nurse who worked on the vaccination campaign, told the AP in 2023 that anti-vaccine campaigners \u201cgot louder\u201d after Kennedy\u2019s visit.",
      "\u201cI feel like they felt they had the support of Kennedy,\u201d she said.",
      "However, Ekeroma said that Kennedy's overtures weren't heeded by the nation\u2019s leaders. A vaccination campaign resumed in 2019 and measles vaccines are now compulsory for Samoan children.",
      "If Kennedy is affirmed as the top U.S. health official this week, it would be \u201ca danger to us, a danger to everyone,\u201d Ekeroma said. Kennedy would control U.S. funding for vaccination initiatives and could make affordable vaccines harder for small nations like Samoa to access, the official said.",
      "\u201cIf he\u2019s going to be appointed, then we will have to actually discuss around the Pacific as to how we\u2019re going to try to neutralize his influence in the region,\u201d he added.",

      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year\u2019s horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple",
      "With his 70th birthday looming on this year's horizon, Microsoft founder Bill Gates looked inward to open a window into the man behind Windows and other seminal software that turned the personal computer into a household staple.",
      "Gates focuses on the first quarter-century of his life in \u201cSource Code: My Beginnings,\u201d the opening installment in a retrospective trilogy about an insouciant, impertinent and often misunderstood kid who grew up to become a polarizing technology titan before morphing into an influential philanthropist.",
      "In \u201cSource Code,\u201d Gates explores how his childhood quirks, upbringing, friendships and experiences coalesced into shaping his own internal operating system. Along the way, he dissects his brain's unusual wiring, delves into the emotional trauma of his best friend dying while they were both in high school, and revisits the birth of Traf-O-Data, a trailblazing startup that he launched in Albuquerque, New Mexico with another childhood friend, Paul Allen.",
      "Traf-O-Data, conceived to create software for the groundbreaking Altair computer made Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, became Microsoft in 1975 \u2014 a year it booked $16,005 in revenue while Gates and Allen were making $9 per hour.",
      "By 1977, Microsoft had become successful enough to embolden Gates to drop out of Harvard University. In 1979, he had decided to move Microsoft to the Seattle area where he grew up. Although Gates stepped down as Microsoft's CEO 25 years ago, the Windows operating system and other software created under his reign remain the main pillar in a company that now generates $212 billion in annual revenue, boasts a $3.1 trillion market value, and accounts for most of Gates' $100 billion personal fortune.",
      "\u201cSource Code\u201d ends with Gates's drive back to Seattle in 1979, meaning it doesn't touch upon his 1994 marriage to Melinda French, nor their 2021 divorce.",
      "\u201cI am being reflective, which is not my normal mode, but it\u2019s kind of time,\u201d Gates said during an interview about the book with The Associated Press. \u201cAs we went back and got teacher\u2019s comments or people I worked with at Harvard, it was fascinating. I had confused myself into thinking I got straight A\u2019s in ninth grade.\u201d",
      "That might not sound like much of a revelation, but it was a surprise to the cerebral Gates, who paints himself in the book as a \u201cbratty smartass\u201d prone to dismissively sneering, \u201cThat's the stupidest thing I ever heard,\u201d about remarks that seemed nonsensical to him.",
      "Gate's self-portrait is that of a nerd nicknamed \u201cTrey\u201d by his card-playing grandmother because he was the third male on this father's side of the family to be named Bill. He was a pipsqueak who had difficulty making friends and preferred living in his own head before he discovered computers, which became like slot machines that rewarded him for writing elegant lines of code.",
      "When he did talk, the young Gates rocked back and forth like a metronome setting a rhythm for his brain \u2014 a habit that surfaced during parts of his 45-minute interview with the AP.",
      "\u201cIt was a little weird because it was hard to direct my attention,\u201d Gates recalled during the interview. \u201cI had one year in school where they said, \u2018Oh we should put you ahead a couple grades.\u2019 And then another time, they said, \u2018No, we should hold you back.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, \u2018Well make up your mind.\u2019 They were a little confounded.\u201d",
      "Although he didn't realize it as a boy, Gates has no doubt he was and still is neurodivergent who channeled that anomaly into learning to program computers at the right time in the right place with the patient support of his late parents (the book is dedicated to them, along with his sister, Kristi and Libby).",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that there was this idea that there are kids that have this kind of unique ability to concentrate but less social skills. I certainly would be included in that,\u201d Gates said. \u201cI encourage people who have strengths and deficits to kind of map their ambition onto something that plays to their strengths. Being able to think just about programming and how you do it better ended up being invaluable for me.\u201d",
      "Gates also had the advantage of growing up in a family that could afford to pay for him to attend a private high school in Seattle. Still, that privilege didn't insulate him from the trauma he experienced when his best friend, Kent Evans, died in a mountain climbing accident in May 1972 \u2014 a year before they were going to graduate.",
      "Evans' death occurred while he and Gates were preparing to spend much of the summer working on a program for their school, but what hurt far more was the loss of someone who understood him and helped give him a sense of purpose for the first time in his life.",
      "\u201cI had no notion of a friend just being gone. It was the only negative thing in my childhood,\u201d Gates said. \u201cIt shapes you, that someone can just disappear \u2014 somebody you loved and would have done things with. He would have been part of whatever I ended up going on to do. I give Kent credit, along with Paul (Allen), for setting the direction that I ended up going down.\u201d",
      "Evans' death provided the impetus for Gates to reconnect with Allen, who was already attending college, to help him with his programming projects. Allen, three years older than Gates and a passionate fan of legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix, did more than just help with the coding. He also offered Gates some LSD in an attempt to lure his partner down a more psychedelic path.",
      "Gates rebuffed Allen at first but decided to drop acid with a group of high school friends shortly before his 1973 graduation, according to the book.",
      "It wasn't a pleasant experience, a reaction that Gates thought might have been related to the dental surgery he underwent the day after his LSD trip. He tried LSD again with Allen in October 1974 while they were watching an episode of the old \"Kung Fu\" series on TV, and decided he would be better off without psychedelic drugs even though Apple co-founder Steve Jobs contended Microsoft would have created better products had Gates taken more acid.",
      "\"I thought maybe I\u2019d seem cool if I took it, but that didn\u2019t happen,\" Gates said during the interview. \u201cI would say Steve was definitely more hip than I was. He took a lot more acid than I did. He had a sense of style. I had some charisma in terms of motivating engineers and saying this great thing (with personal computers) would happen, but Steve had natural speaking and charisma capabilities, even beyond mine. So I always envied him for the things he did.\"",
      "Gates' mind is now being blown by the recent advances in artificial intelligence \u2014 a technology being planted into Microsoft's software as part of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.",
      "\u201cWhen I finally see ChatGPT-4, where the OpenAI guys show me a very early version, I am just blown away completely,\u201d Gates said. He views AI as an \u201camazing and scary\u201d technology that should be rigorously monitored.",
      "\u201cYou should be nervous. We have to acknowledge that AI is almost uniquely dangerous because it\u2019s unbounded in terms of how good it will get and it\u2019s happening within a generation,\u201d Gates said. \u201cHopefully, the politicians and the technologists will share with each other, and we can shape this thing. We better get on top of that now.\u201d",
      "If nothing else, Gates is hoping \u201cSource Code\u201d will help people see a more human side of him, even if he might never been seen as the cultural tastemaker that Jobs was.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I was completely uncool,\u201d Gates said. \u201cBut once I got going on Microsoft, I was willing to be pretty monomaniacal. Even people I competed with found it very intimidating how focused I was. I really didn\u2019t goof off in my 20s because my whole thing was having Microsoft move at full speed.\u201d",
      "Perhaps Gates will delve deeper into the monomania that made him so rich, famous and sometimes reviled in the next book about his life \u2014 an installment that he says won't be done until sometime in 2027, at the earliest."

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",
      "But the new study adds a more \"specific and local picture to how lead levels changed,\u201d said Nathan Chellman, an environmental scientist at the University of Nevada, Reno, who was not involved in the research.",

      "The meeting at the White House was confirmed by a person familiar who insisted on anonymity to discuss the conversation between Huang and Trump. The person said the meeting was set up weeks ago and would enable them to get acquainted and talk about AI policy. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to comment on the meeting.",
      "Nvidia had loudly protested a last-minute move by the Biden administration in January to expand AI chip restrictions beyond adversaries like China to more than 100 other countries, including Singapore. But it remains to be seen if Trump will follow through with or drop those proposed rules.",

      "The Republican president is banking on AI to foster economic growth and draw hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, but he also saw the performance of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI technology as a sign that the technology can be developed more cheaply.",
      "Speaking Monday to House Republicans in Miami, Trump called the DeepSeek news \u201cpositive\u201d if it\u2019s accurate because \u201cyou won\u2019t be spending as much and you\u2019ll get the same result.\u201d",

DeepSeek began attracting more attention in the AI industry last month when it released a new AI model that it boasted was on par with similar models from U.S. companies such as ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and was more cost-effective in its use of expensive Nvidia chips to train the system on troves of data. The chatbot became more widely accessible when it appeared on Apple and Google app stores early this year.",
      "The meeting between Trump and Huang comes as leaders of a special House committee focused on countering China have urged Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Michael Waltz, to consider the potential national security benefits of placing export controls on Nvidia semiconductor chips used by DeepSeek. They said the examination should be part of a review that Trump ordered on his first day in office that called on the secretaries of State and Commerce to review the U.S. export control system.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said DeepSeek made extensive use of a Nvidia chip designed specifically to fall outside U.S. export controls. The lawmakers said that the committee supports American AI innovation, and that support \u201cincludes imposing reasonable safeguards\u201d to protect those innovations from China.",
      "\u201cThis demonstrates what the Select Committee has long argued: frequently updating export controls is imperative to ensure (China) will not exploit regulatory gaps and loopholes to advance their AI ambitions,\u201d the two lawmakers wrote in letter dated Wednesday.",
      "The pair asked that Waltz look for ways to strengthen controls on shipments through third countries \u201cthat pose a high risk of diversion.\u201d Singapore, the letter said, represented 22% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue in its most recently quarterly statement, \u201cdespite the company itself revealing most of these shipments ultimately went to users outside of Singapore.\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- Former Hawaii lawmaker Suzanne Chun Oakland remembers arriving at school one morning in 1977 to an eerie buzz.",
      "The 15-year-old had met up with girlfriends as usual before class at Honolulu's McKinley High School when she learned a student named Dawn Momohara had been found dead on the second floor of a school building.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we got word of it, but everything spread really quickly,\u201d Chun Oakland said.",
      "Chun Oakland didn't know Momohara, who was 16, but the unsolved death has haunted her and other McKinley students and staff for nearly half a century. That was until last week, when police used advances in DNA technology to arrest a 66-year-old resident of a Utah nursing home.",
      "The suspect, former McKinley student Gideon Castro, was scheduled to make an initial court appearance Friday before a judge in Salt Lake County District Court. He remained in custody Thursday with the bond for his release set at $250,000, according to Salt Lake County Sheriff\u2019s Office records.",
      "Castro\u2019s attorney, Marlene Mohn, did not respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.",
      "Momohara had been sexually assaulted and strangled, police said.",
      "\u201cI was just really sad,\" Chun Oakland recalled earlier this week. \"I think for our student body, of course there\u2019s that concern that what if he\u2019s still out there and he does it to somebody else.\u201d",
      "On March 21, 1977, shortly after 7:30 a.m., Honolulu police found Momohara lying on her back, partially clothed, an orange cloth wrapped tightly around her neck.",
      "Details from more than four decades ago are fuzzy for 1967 McKinley graduate Grant Okamura, who was the school\u2019s 28-year-old band teacher in 1977, but the morning Momohara was found has remained a core memory.",
      "Momohara's sister \u2014 one of his flute players \u2014 arrived at school that day not knowing her sister had been found dead, he recalled. The sister was called to the office and later walked into the band room, devastated.",
      "\u201cThe other students were trying to console her,\" Okamura said. \"At that point, I couldn't have band. How do you have a class? She just sat there crying.\u201d",
      "She didn't return to school for weeks afterward.",
      "He doesn't remember the sister's name. The Associated Press was unable to make contact with any possible relatives. Okamura said he met Momohara a few times when he let her into the air-conditioned band room to wait for her sister.",
      "The morning before Momohara was killed, she got a call from an unknown male and told her mother she was going to a nearby shopping center with friends. That was the last time her mother saw her, homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes said.",
      "Police released sketches of a person of interest and a possible vehicle described by witnesses as a 1974 or 1975 Pontiac Lemans. A witness reported seeing the car when he and his girlfriend drove through campus the night before Momohara died. The witness saw a man and the car on the grass near the school's English building, Thoemmes said.",
      "The witness circled back around but the car and the man were gone.",
      "Police were unable to identify a suspect and the case grew cold, though grief lingered over the campus.",
      "In 2019, cold case detectives asked a forensic biology unit to examine several items of evidence from the scene, including Momohara's underwear. They were able to develop a DNA profile in 2020. Then, in 2023, police received information about potential suspects, two brothers who were interviewed in 1977.",
      "Several days after Momohara was killed, detectives interviewed Castro, who graduated from McKinley High in 1976. He said he met Momohara at a school dance that year and last saw her at a carnival on campus in February 1977. Police interviewed his brother, who also met Momohara at the dance.",
      "In November 2023, Honolulu police went to Chicago, where the brother was living. They \u201csurreptitiously\u201d obtained DNA from one of the brother's adult children, Thoemmes said.",
      "Lab findings excluded the brother as a suspect, but a DNA sample from Castro's adult son, and later from Castro himself, proved he was responsible, Thoemmes said.",
      "He was arrested last week at the nursing home where he lived in Millcreek, just south of Salt Lake City, on suspicion of second-degree murder.",
      "Neither Okamura nor Chun Oakland remembered Castro.",
      "Chun Oakland graduated in 1979 and grew up to become a Democratic member of the Hawaii Senate. She said Momohara's killing bothered her over the years, especially when she would meet victims through her work as a lawmaker or as a board member of the nonprofit Sex Abuse Treatment Center, a statewide program provding services for sexual assault survivors.",
      "Chun Oakland said she is grateful an arrest was possible even after all these years.",
      "\u201cI think the community in general, and our elected officials, they know the importance of trying to preserve the evidence that can someday be able to see justice for that individual or individuals,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro says he wants to fast-track the construction of power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that produce electricity and use hydrogen",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Josh Shapiro said Thursday that he wants to fast-track the construction of big power plants in Pennsylvania and offer hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks for projects that provide electricity to the grid and use hydrogen.",
      "Shapiro's announcement comes a few days before he delivers his third budget proposal to lawmakers amid an energy crunch that threatens to raise electricity bills across Pennsylvania, the nation's second-biggest natural gas-producing state.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, said he wants to start the \u201cnext chapter in Pennsylvania\u2019s long story of energy leadership\u201d and keep pace with other states that are attracting big projects, such as data centers and electric vehicle factories.",
      "\"Pennsylvania, it\u2019s time for us to be more competitive. It\u2019s time for us to act. We need to take some big and decisive steps right now, build new sources of power so Pennsylvania doesn't miss out,\u201d Shapiro said at a news conference at Pittsburgh International Airport.",
      "Shapiro said Pennsylvania is one of just 12 states that doesn't have an entity to fast-track siting decisions for energy projects. He wants to change that by creating the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board to streamline permitting and support for new energy projects.",
      "\"We need shovels in the ground now, not in the years to come,\" Shapiro said.",
      "The tax credits Shapiro is proposing are aimed at large projects producing electricity, using hydrogen and making hydrogen-based aviation fuel.",
      "A new power plant could qualify for up to $100 million per year for three years based on the amount of power the facility can produce, under Shapiro's plan.",
      "The Shapiro administration said it would leave it to lawmakers to hammer out what sort of power plants would qualify for a tax credit, although they said it wouldn't include the proposed restart of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to feed data centers run by tech giant Microsoft.",
      "At the federal level, former President Joe Biden's administration enacted rules last year as a centerpiece of his efforts to fight climate change by requiring coal and newer, higher-usage gas plants to slash their carbon dioxide emissions by 90% to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gases from a major source.",
      "For the other tax credits, a user of hydrogen fuel could qualify for up to $49 million a year and an aviation fuel producer could qualify for up to $15 million a year, under Shapiro's plan. The hydrogen-related tax credits are an attempt to create demand for the two federally subsidized hydrogen-making projects in which Pennsylvania or some of its businesses and institutions play a role, another part of Biden\u2019s agenda to slow climate change.",
      "The plans would require approval from lawmakers. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Shapiro\u2019s energy policy, saying it is a major hurdle for Pennsylvania to attract companies that want to build big new natural gas-fired power plants and stabilize the power grid.",
      "Shapiro's plans elicited applause from renewable energy advocates, while business groups echoed Republican criticism, but said they were encouraged by Shapiro's focus on energy.",
      "Shapiro's plan unveiled last year to make power plant owners in the nation\u2019s third-biggest energy-producing state pay for their greenhouse gas emissions and require utilities to buy more electricity from renewable sources gained no traction in the Legislature.",
      "One project Shapiro said he wants to help is a proposal by natural gas producer CNX Resources to build a $1.5 billion facility at Pittsburgh\u2019s airport to make hydrogen-based fuels.",
      "CNX has said it would only go through with it if the federal government allows coal mine methane to qualify for tax credits that were central to Biden's plan to fight climate change.",

    "story": [
      "He said the U.S. would \"level the site\" and create \"an economic development.\"",
      "In a stunning proposal, President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. will \"take over\" the Gaza Strip, \"level the site\" and rebuild it, after earlier saying Palestinians living there should leave.",
      "\"They instead can occupy all of a beautiful area with homes and safety, and they can live out their lives in peace and harmony\" in other areas or countries, he said at a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site. Level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings. Level it out,\" he said.",
      "\"Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area,\" he added. \"Do a real job. Do something different.\"",
      "\"We should go to other countries of interest with humanitarian hearts, and there are many of them that want to do this, and build various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the 1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the death and destruction and frankly, bad luck,\" he said. \"This can be paid for by neighboring countries of great wealth. It could be one, two, three, four, five, seven, eight, 12. It could be numerous sites, or it could be one large site,\" he said.",
      "\"But the people will be able to live in comfort and peace and will get sure -- we'll make sure something really spectacular is done. They're going to have peace. They're not going to be shot at and killed and destroyed like this civilization of -- of wonderful people has had to endure. The only reason the Palestinians want to go back to Gaza is they have no alternative,\" he said.",
      "\"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East. And everybody I have spoken to, this was not a decision made lightly,\" he continued. \"Everybody I have spoken to loves the idea of the United States owning that piece of land, developing and creating thousands of jobs with something that will be magnificent in a really magnificent area that nobody would know.\"",
      "Asked who would live there, Trump responded, \"the world's people,\" saying, \"the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable.\"",
      "\"History, as you know, just can't let it keep repeating itself. We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. And I don't want to be cute. I don't want to be a wise guy. But the Riviera of the Middle East, this could be something that could be so ... magnificent,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, in the Oval Office, when he also raised the idea, a reporter asked if Palestinians relocated would have the right to return.",
      "\"Why would they want to return?\" he responded.",
      "\"It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't want to return,\" he said. Why would they want to return? That place has been hell. It's been one of the meanest, one of the meanest, toughest places on earth,\" he said.",
      "Asked about sending U.S. troops to Gaza, Trump appeared open to the possibility.",
      "\"As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that,\" Trump said. \"We're going to take over that place and we're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs.\"",
      "Netanyahu, delivering remarks after Trump, praised the president for his \"fresh ideas\" to accomplish their goals, which he said included ensuring Gaza is not a threat to Israel.",
      "\"I believe, Mr. President, that your willingness to puncture conventional thinking, thinking that has failed time and time and time again, your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas will help us achieve all these goals,\" he said.",
      "Asked if his view that Palestinians should be relocated from Gaza is a sign that he is against the two-state policy that has been the foreign policy approach of the United States for decades, Trump said no.",
      "\"It doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one state or any other state. It means that we want to have, we want to give people a chance at life,\" he said. \"They have never had a chance at life because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole for people living there. It's been horrible.\"",
      "The president argued that his proposal would benefit the Middle East as a whole and not only Israel.",
      "\"I have to stress, this is not for Israel,\" he said. \"This is for everybody in the Middle East. Arabs, Muslims, this is for everybody. You have to learn from history. You can't keep doing the same mistake over and over again. Gaza is a hellhole right now,\" he said.",
      "\"I've studied it. I've studied this very closely over a lot of months, and I've seen it from every different angle,\" he said. \"And it's a very, very dangerous place to be. And it's only going to get worse. And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous -- and I'm talking about from the highest level of leadership -- gotten tremendous praise.\"",
      "He said he had \"a feeling\" that despite Jordan's king and Egypt's president opposing his idea to \"clean out\" Gaza and have them take in Palestinians, they \"will open their hearts and will give us the kind of land that we need to get this done. And people can live in harmony and peace,\" he said, as the extraordinary news conference ended.",

      "The deportation flight landed at at 7:20 p.m. ET, according to U.S. Transportation Command.",
      "The 10 people on the flight were suspected members of the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The migrants, however, will not be co-located with existing detainees at Guantanamo Bay, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement will have the primary guard of them.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 29 directing the secretaries of the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to \"expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to full capacity\" to house migrants without legal status living in the United States.",
      "\"There's a lot of space to accommodate a lot of people,\"  Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. \"So we're going to use it.",
      "\"The migrants are rough, but we have some bad ones, too,\" he added. \"I'd like to get them out. It would be all subject to the laws of our land, and we're looking at that to see if we can.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo Bay were underway Tuesday morning, saying on Fox News, \"Trump, Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem are already delivering on this promise to utilize that capacity at Gitmo for illegal criminals who have broken our nation's immigration laws and then have further committed heinous crimes against lawful American citizens here at home.\"",
      "While Trump has said the United States will work to prepare the base to hold 30,000 migrants awaiting processing to return to their home countries, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday that Guantanamo Bay's high-security prison facility could house \"the worst of the worst\" criminals being deported.",
      "\"Where are you going to put Tren de Aragua before you send them all the way back?\" Hegseth asked. \"How about a maximum-security prison at Guantanamo Bay, where we have the space?\"",
      "He called the base \"the perfect place to provide for migrants who are traveling out of our country,\" including for \"hardened criminals.\"",
      "\"President @realdonaldtrump has been very clear: Guantanamo Bay will hold the worst of the worst. That starts today,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on Tuesday. It is unclear what charges the migrants on the plane face.",
      "As of Monday, there were about 300 service members supporting the immigrant holding operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, according to U.S. Southern Command. U.S. officials told ABC News that as many as 200 more Marines are expected to arrive in waves.",
      "The Defense Department posted that the troops are at Guantanamo Bay \"to prepare to expand the Migrant Operations Center\" to house up to the 30,000 migrants temporarily, separate from the maximum-security prison.",
      "\"As we identify criminal illegals in our country, the military is leaning forward to help with moving them out to their home countries or someone else in the interim,\" Hegseth said on Jan. 31. \"Now if \u2026 they can't go somewhere right away, they can go to Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "Karen Greenberg, director of the Center on National Security at Fordham University School of Law, told ABC News' Phil Lipof on Jan. 29 that a \"big challenge\" of holding migrants at Guantanamo Bay is the large number Trump has suggested.",
      "\"I don't know that they have the capacity for that,\" said Greenberg, who noted that \"in the old days and the '90s, I think they held 21,000 at the most.\"",
      "She added that the base has repeatedly held refugees and migrants, including in the Biden administration, though in much smaller numbers.",
      "However, Greenberg noted that the reports from those who have spent time at Guantanamo Bay are \"not good.\"",

    "summary": "A look at how Kennedy convinced Sen. Cassidy, a doctor and vaccination advocate, that he should become health secretary.",
    "story": [
      "The GOP senator spent a career pushing vaccines while Kennedy questioned them.",
      "On Monday night, just hours ahead of a Senate committee vote Tuesday on Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as health secretary, Sen. Bill Cassidy was still deciding what to do.",
      "Cassidy, who worked 30 years in public hospitals in Louisiana, is a lifelong advocate of vaccinations. After watching a young woman almost die of liver failure after contracting hepatitis B, the doctor helped to create a program offering free shots to school children.",
      "Kennedy, on the other hand, had built a large following on social media by questioning the safety of vaccines and falsely linking them to autism, despite numerous large studies debunking the myth.",
      "Now, Cassidy was the sole GOP senator on the Senate Finance Committee openly questioning whether Kennedy was the right man for the job. A single \"no\" vote by any Republican on the panel could have been enough to derail the nomination by President Donald Trump, who said he picked Kennedy to \"go wild\" on issues related to food, medicine and health.",
      "Cassidy said he was asking: \"Would it be possible to have Mr. Kennedy collaborate in helping public health agencies re-earn the trust of the American people?\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican said he received \"hundreds\" of personal messages a day and \"thousands\" more through his Senate office. Worried pediatricians urged Cassidy to block Kennedy from the job, blaming Kennedy for a rise in vaccine hesitancy among parents. There were pro-Kennedy social media influencers too, including \"MAHA moms\" \u2013 a reference to Kennedy's call to \"Make America Healthy Again\" -- demanding that he be given a chance to shake up what they saw as a broken system.",
      "\"It was a massive coalition that worked together to bring together several different groups that were literally shutting down the phone lines over the weekend and late last week and yesterday,\" Vani Hari, a food influencer nicknamed the \"Food Babe\" on social media, told ABC News.",
      "\"The messaging was very positive,\" she said.",
      "According to one person familiar with Cassidy's thinking, the senator was 95%\" of the way to a \"yes\" vote on Monday night, but that the issue of vaccines stood in the way.",
      "In particular, Cassidy was worried about a potential measles outbreak if Kennedy were to assume control of America's health agencies and continue to raise doubt about the vaccine, which had been used for decades to prevent the highly contagious and potentially deadly childhood disease.",
      "\"He needed something to just let him feel comfortable enough that he wouldn't be responsible for the death of children because of this,\" the person told ABC News of Cassidy's concerns.",
      "A lifelong Republican, Cassidy had already defied President Donald Trump once by voting in 2021 in favor of a single article of impeachment of Trump in connection to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and faces a Republican primary challenger for his Senate seat next year.",
      "By Tuesday, Cassidy appeared to have gotten what he needed to vote \"yes.\" After speaking several times with Kennedy by phone throughout the weekend and again the morning of the vote, Cassidy announced on the social media platform X that he had \"serious commitments\" from both Kennedy and the White House.",
      "Among those promises is that Kennedy will give advanced notice to Congress if he imposes any changes to vaccine safety monitoring and will meet with Cassidy several times a month to build a working relationship.",
      "Both the administration and Kennedy had sought \"to reassure me regarding their commitment to protecting the public health benefit of vaccination\" and offering an \"unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Cassidy's support paves the way for a full vote by the Senate.",
      "\"It's been a long, intense process, but I assessed it as I would assess a patient as a physician. Ultimately, restoring trust in our public health institution is too important, and I think Mr. Kennedy can help get that done,\" Cassidy said.",
      "How a doctor and lifelong advocate of vaccinations found himself voting for Kennedy is an indication of Trump's grip on the Republican party, experts say. And while Cassidy might believe he can keep Kennedy in check, there's not much motivation for the new administration to keep promises to individual lawmakers.",
      "\"It's a totally different kind of Washington,\" said Sarah Isgur, a Republican who served in the first Trump administration and is now an ABC News contributor.",
      "Whereas in the past, lawmakers and members of the executive branch worked closely together to build the kinds of relationships that might extend long after they leave public service, the current administration says its focus is forcing through big changes, not making friends or future job connections.",
      "\"Cassidy is doing something very rational, which was done in past administrations,\" said Isgur. \"But it's based on a previous version of Washington \u2026 This administration has made clear they are not running the government on relationships.\"",
      "In another time, Kennedy's nomination would have been unthinkable. A Democrat whose cousin Caroline Kennedy told senators was a \"predator\" who sought only attention and fame, Kennedy is known for promoting debunked conspiracy theories on health. In recent years, he chaired the Children's Health Defense, a group that advocates against the recommended schedule for children's vaccines. He also played a central role in preparing a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the HPV vaccine. He has since promised to divest potential proceeds in the case, which is ongoing, to his adult son.",
      "Kennedy counters that he believes the pharmaceutical industry is too focused on profits and that medical experts aren't doing enough to question commonly held assertions while Americans suffer from chronic diseases.",
      "\"News reports have claimed that I'm anti-vaccine or any industry. I am neither. I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy told lawmakers last week.",
      "Brad Woodhouse, director of the liberal advocacy group Protect Our Care, said the fight wasn't over until the full Senate votes.",
      "\"Every Senator will now have to weigh in, and we aren't giving up on any vote,\" he said in a statement released shortly after the vote.",
      "Republicans have a 53-seat majority, allowing Kennedy to lose three Republicans and still survive with Vice President JD Vance casting a tie breaking vote if necessary.",
      "GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky are widely seen as potential \"no\" votes because of their willingness to challenge the administration on other issues. McConnell, a polio survivor, has spoken previously about the value of a health secretary who supports medical consensus on vaccines.",
      "Another potential swing vote -- Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina \u2013 already announced he would back Kennedy after receiving assurances that Kennedy wouldn't intercept the work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the National Institutes of Health",
      "The Trump administration has already paused major functions at CDC, including blocking the release of the agency's weekly publication -- the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report -- as part of a pause on all public communications to ensure everything released is in line with Trump's agenda.",
      "\"I for one, think that it is time to put a disruptor in. It is time to put somebody in there that's going to go wild,\" Tillis said.",
      "Democrats said they too want someone to challenge the status quo on chronic disease, but said Kennedy's denial of scientific consensus wouldn't help Americans.",

      "\u201cWhen the Tennessee Legislature passed a law that banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, I knew we had to leave the state so that my daughter could continue receiving the care she needs,\u201d said Kristen Chapman, the mother of 17-year-old plaintiff Willow, in a statement.",
      "The Virginia resident continued: \"We moved to Virginia in the summer of 2023, but struggled to find a provider that would accept our Medicaid insurance. As paying for her care out-of-pocket became prohibitively expensive, I tried for months to get an appointment at VCU, and I finally got an appointment for January 29, 2025. The day before our appointment, President Trump signed the executive order at issue in this case. The next day, just a few hours before our appointment, VCU told us they would not be able to provide Willow with care. I thought Virginia would be a safe place for me and my daughter. Instead, I am heartbroken, tired, and scared.\u201d",
      "Trump's order moves to withhold federal funding to medical institutions that provide such care -- including puberty blockers, hormone therapies, and surgeries -- calling on the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \"take all appropriate actions to end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" The executive order does not appear to restrict these procedures for non-transgender people under 19.",
      "Trump's executive order states that \"it is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.\"",

      "It continued, \"Puberty-delaying medication allows transgender adolescents to pause these changes, thereby minimizing and potentially preventing the heightened gender dysphoria caused by the development of secondary sex characteristics incongruent with their gender identity.\"",
      "The executive order is the latest action from Trump that impacts the transgender community -- which is estimated to make up less than 1% of the population over the age of 13. Trump also recently signed executive orders restricting transgender participation in the military, ending federal legal recognition of transgender people, and restricting gender marker changes on federal documents.",

      "Some legal scholars say they're concerned about what this could mean for free speech on college campuses following more than a year of tension between students, faculty and administrators, while other experts noted that past McCarthy-era cases on communist activity could foreshadow the action's legal standing.",
      "The main thrust of the executive order's purpose: \"Jewish students have faced an unrelenting barrage of discrimination; denial of access to campus common areas and facilities, including libraries and classrooms; and intimidation, harassment, and physical threats and assault,\" the order reads.",
      "The fact sheet released by the White House on the new executive action threatens to \"deport\" college students in the United States on student visas and other \u201cresident aliens\u201d who expressed \"pro-Hamas\" or \"pro-jihadist\" views to \"combat antisemitism on college campuses and in communities across the nation.\" It calls for immediate action to be taken by the Department of Justice to \"quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"",

      "\"There was this distinction; it's one thing to say, government may not prosecute you, you may not be subject to civil penalties, but you may still be subject to deportation because of this doctrine that Congress has what's called plenary power, pretty much unchecked power, with respect to matters concerning who is able to be present in this country and not present in this country,\" said Strossen.",

But many of the student groups behind the protests \u2013 including Jewish activists \u2013 have said that individuals making inflammatory remarks do not represent their groups or their values concerning the war in Gaza.",
      "Other Jewish or pro-Israel students around the country have spoken out about the pressures they too have faced, including renewed concerns about safety and acts of hate as law enforcement noted a spike in antisemitic incidents.",

Before Trump came in -- from their own universities -- students have been evicted from student housing and been homeless for minor, minor rule violations. They've been suspended, they've been expelled, they've lost scholarships, they've lost financial aid. The harm is really, really great, and many of these students are first-generation students. They are low-income students, and it can be quite harmful to be punished again for speaking out against a genocide.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 20:46:19 -0500",
    "summary": "While President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to lower fuel prices, energy experts predicted that his pending tariffs would increase prices at the gas pump.",
    "story": [
      "\"The whole 'drill, baby, drill' thing is highly overblown,\" one expert said.",
      "While President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to lower fuel prices for U.S. consumers with an edict of \"drill, baby, drill,\" energy experts predicted his pending tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China will lead to Americans paying more at the gas pump.",
      "Trump has signed an executive order slapping a 25% tariff on imports from Canada, with a 10% charge on natural gas and oil. Under it, Mexico will also be hit with a 25% tax on imports, including oil. And China faces a 10% tariff on all imports.",
      "As a result of Trump's actions, Canada has threatened to reciprocate with a 25% tariff on U.S. imports and Mexico has vowed to hit the U.S. with tariffs, which could further jack up prices for U.S. consumers.",
      "Chinese officials also struck back Tuesday, announcing a 15% tariff on select American goods, including coal and liquefied natural gas, as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, pickup trucks and other products.",
      "\"China firmly opposes the U.S. practice and urges the United States to correct its wrong practices immediately,\" the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement.",
      "Canada sends US 4.5 million barrels of petroleum a day",
      "The tit-for-tat over tariffs could soon be felt by U.S. consumers, Wall Street analyst Stewart Glickman, deputy director of the global financial research firm CFRA, told ABC News.",
      "\"Higher prices at the pump are, unfortunately, a good way to stoke inflation,\" Glickman said.",
      "Both Canada and Mexico are among the Top 5 sources of the country's total petroleum imports, including crude oil, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Canada is the source of 52% of U.S. gross total petroleum, including 60% of its gross crude oil imports, according to EIA.",
      "Meanwhile, Mexico accounts for about 10% of petroleum and crude oil imported by the United States, according to EIA.",
      "Trump announced Monday that he is pausing the tariffs for a month after speaking with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "In his executive order, Trump said he was imposing the tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China to hold those countries \"accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.\" He said the tariffs will remain in place until Mexico, Canada and China honor their promises.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump urged the three countries to address his concerns, while acknowledging the tariffs may cause some financial hardship to U.S. consumers.",
      "\"WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Glickman said Canada exports 4.5 million barrels of petroleum a day to the United States and Mexico exports to the U.S. up to 500,000 barrels a day.",
      "\"Canada is a bigger deal because of the huge volumes the U.S. imports from Canada,\" said Glickman, who focuses on the energy sector.",
      "Gas prices expected to jump",
      "Under the tariffs, Glickman predicted U.S. consumers will quickly see prices at gas pumps going up an estimated 9 cents per gallon.",
      "Glickman said U.S. consumers could begin feeling the pinch at the pumps a few weeks after the tariffs go into effect, \"after refiners go through more of their stockpiled imports.\"",
      "As of Tuesday, the average price for a gallon of regular gas ranged from $2.63 in Mississippi to $4.50 in California and Hawaii, according to GasBuddy, a website that tracks fuel prices nationwide.",
      "\"The national average has seen little meaningful change over the past week, as oil markets continue to face selling pressure,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, wrote in a blog post on the company's website on Monday. \"However, with President Trump imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico, some motorists may see gas prices inch up in certain regions.\"",
      "De Haan estimated that gas prices could increase 5 to 20 cents per gallon. He said markets that rely heavily on Canadian crude oil or refined product imports from Canada such as the Great Lakes, Midwest, the Rockies and the Northeast will feel the pain at the pump the most.",
      "\"Trump's new trade tax has already triggered retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating tensions,\" De Haan wrote. \"While, on paper, tariffs on Canadian energy could have a significant impact on fuel prices, prolonged trade tax increases could weaken global economies, reducing demand and partially offsetting the effects of tariffs.\"",
      "When Trump ran for a second term in the White House, he made lowering fuel prices the cornerstone of his economic recovery plan after inflation surged to its highest level in 40 years under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I make this pledge to the great people of America: I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately, bring down interest rates and lower the cost of energy,\" Trump announced to the crowd at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as he accepted his nomination at the Republican National Convention in July.",
      "\"We will drill, baby, drill,\" Trump said, garnering resounding cheers and applause from the RNC audience.",
      "But Glickman said Trump's oil and gas slogan \"is highly overblown.\"",
      "\"It's not like U.S. producers were champing at the bit to produce more and were being stymied by a virtue-signaling Biden administration,\" Glickman said.",
      "Glickman said the United States remains the leader in crude oil production, producing 13.2 million barrels a day in 2024. He said EIA is forecasting that the United States will produce 13.5 million barrels a day in 2025.",
      "\"U.S. producers are quite happy to generate modest production growth and also plow a lot of cash flow into dividends and buybacks,\" Glickman said. \"So, (1) 'drill baby drill' is not really a realistic thing, and (2) tariffs are more likely to push prices higher, not lower.\"",

      "President Donald Trump has nominated Neil Jacobs, an atmospheric scientist, to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "If confirmed, this will be Jacobs' second stint leading the agency. Beginning in 2019, he served as its acting administrator until Trump left office at the end of his term in January 2021.",
      "Jacobs is remembered for the so-called \"Sharpiegate\" incident, a September 2019 controversy during which Trump, in an Oval Office press briefing, showed a map of Hurricane Dorian's forecast track that appeared to have been altered with a black pen to show the storm's track extended to include southern Alabama. Though the official storm track from the National Weather Service (NWS) did not have it hitting the state, Trump had inaccurately declared a few days earlier that it would.",
      "Shortly after Trump made the claim, NOAA issued a statement siding with Trump and admonishing the NWS for publicly saying that Alabama was not in danger from the storm.",
      "Dorian ultimately did not make landfall in the U.S. and stayed east of Florida.",
      "The NOAA Science Council subsequently investigated Jacobs, saying that he violated the organization's scientific integrity policy by issuing a statement supporting Trump's incorrect claim about Dorian's storm track as an official NOAA release.",
      "Jacobs is currently the chief science advisor for the community Unified Forecast System (UFS), part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's (UCAR) Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science at North Carolina State University.",
      "The UFS is an effort by the broad scientific community to develop a common, open-source modeling infrastructure that encourages collaboration and eases the transition from research to operations to improve NOAA's forecast models.",
      "Jacobs has long supported an open innovation approach and well-coordinated research efforts that are mutually beneficial to the public, private, and academic sectors. In 2021, he published an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, discussing his vision for the community UFS.",
      "Before serving as NOAA's acting director, Jacobs was the chief atmospheric scientist at Panasonic Avionics Corporation, where he directed the research and development of its aviation weather observing platforms and modeling programs.",
      "In a November 2024 podcast interview, Jacobs shared his views on the future of government agencies, like NOAA, and also weighed in on Project 2025, a playbook of controversial conservative policy proposals co-authored by many Trump allies and members of his first administration, organized by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and which includes recommendations to repeal and eliminate preventive climate change initiatives.",
      "\"Any time there's an administration or an election year, whether it's an incumbent or a new administration, you're always going to have these think tanks and groups pushing transition documents to the transition team saying, this is what you should do, you should read this,\" Jacobs said. \"The executive branch can't just come in and completely change something that's authorized in law.\"",
      "Jacobs also said that \"NOAA has all of these congressional mandates that are codified. Congress would have to rewrite a mountain of legislation to undo all that.\u201d",
      "Last month, Jacobs was recognized as a 2025 Fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) during the organization's annual meeting. An AMS Fellow is a distinction reserved for those who have made \"outstanding contributions to the atmospheric or related oceanic or hydrologic sciences or their applications during a substantial period of years.\"",
      "Jacobs holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics from the University of South Carolina, and master's and doctoral degrees in atmospheric science from North Carolina State University.",

The program offers to continue to pay federal employees through Sept. 30, 2025, if they resign by Feb. 6.",
      "Federal employees have started receiving an email from their specific agency's HR department that contains a PDF contract version of the deferred resignation offer that was sent around last week by the U.S Office of Personnel Management, according to multiple federal employees across multiple agencies who shared the emails with ABC News.",
      "The contract largely lays out what OPM has previously stated would be offered if an employee accepts the deal -- with one major addition: The contract states that by signing, the employee \"forever waives\" the right to take legal action against the agency regarding their employment or the deferred resignation offer.",
      "The agreement states that the employee, in accepting the deferred resignation offer, waives their right to future claims by themselves or their union.",
      "Some employment lawyers have questioned whether the deferred resignation offer is lawful because Congress, not the White House, is responsible for authorizing workers' paychecks. On Friday, senior officials at the various federal agencies sent memos to staffers assuring them the offers were valid and lawful.",

The legislation would deny special government employees and anyone with conflicts of interest or a lack of appropriate clearance any access to the Treasury payment system. It also would include personal tax information into existing privacy protections, according to Schumer.",

      "They must provide care regardless \u201cof the availability of federal funding,\u201d James told providers, noting that New York State laws prohibit discrimination, which includes \u201cwithholding the availability of services from transgender individuals based on their gender identity or their diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while offering such services to cisgender individuals.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The New Jersey man charged with severely injuring author Salman Rushdie in a 2022 knife attack is set to stand trial in New York",
      "MAYVILLE, N.Y. -- In 2022, Salman Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture before a live audience in western New York when a man ran towards him and plunged a knife into the author\u2019s hand as he raised it in self-defense.",
      "\u201cAfter that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere,\u201d Rushdie recalled in a memoir that followed. \u201cI feel my legs give way, and I fall.\u201d",
      "In the coming weeks, Rushdie is expected to return to the same New York county to recount the experience as one of the first witnesses in the trial of the man charged with wielding the knife that day, Hadi Matar.",
      "Jury selection is scheduled to begin Tuesday. Matar, 27, of Fairview, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder and assault.",
      "Under different circumstances, Rushdie\u2019s book, which details his account of that day and his recovery, might offer important evidence in the Aug. 12, 2022, attack that left the 77-year-old blind in his right eye and his hand permanently damaged.",
      "But \u201cthis isn\u2019t a back alley event that occurs unwitnessed in a dark alley,\u201d said Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt following a pretrial hearing. \u201cThis is something that was recorded, it was witnessed live by thousands of people.\u201d",
      "Jurors will be shown video of the attack, as well as still pictures and documentation, Schmidt has said. An estimated 15 witnesses are expected to take the stand over the course of a trial that is projected to last several weeks, he said.",
      "Matar\u2019s lawyer, Nathaniel Barone, has not detailed how he plans to defend his client against the charges. He has clapped back at critics who question why Matar did not take a plea deal in light of the prosecution's case.",
      "\u201cThat's not what this is about. It's about due process,\" Barone said. \u201cIt's about receiving a fair trial ... If someone wants to exercise those rights, they're entitled to do that.\"",
      "In a separate indictment, federal authorities allege that Matar was motivated by a terrorist organization\u2019s endorsement of a fatwa, or edict, calling for Rushdie\u2019s death. A separate trial on the federal charges \u2014 terrorism transcending national boundaries, providing material support to terrorists and attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization \u2014 will be scheduled in U.S. District Court in Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie spent years in hiding after the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa in 1989 after publication of the novel \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which some Muslims consider blasphemous. In the federal indictment, authorities allege Matar believed the edict was backed by the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah and endorsed in a 2006 speech by the group\u2019s then-leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "But jurors in the Chautauqua County case are unlikely to hear about the fatwa, according to Schmidt. He has said he doesn\u2019t anticipate needing to show Matar\u2019s possible motive to get a conviction on the state charges.",
      "\u201cFrom my standpoint, this is a localized event. It\u2019s a stabbing event. It\u2019s fairly straightforward,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a need to get into motive evidence, whether that\u2019s applicable or not applicable and what that consists of. I\u2019d like to avoid all of that.\u201d",
      "Barone, the defense attorney, said jurors should be screened for any prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent nonetheless, given the discussions of the fatwa during previous court proceedings.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve talked about the reason why this alleged crime supposedly occurred was because of this book involving Muslims, all that. So it\u2019s kind of like the barn door\u2019s been opened,\u201d he said.",
      "Matar was born in the U.S. but holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, where his parents were born. Rushdie is a native of India who lived for years in London. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.",
      "Matar has been held without bail since his arrest after being subdued by onlookers who rushed the amphitheater stage. The event\u2019s moderator, Henry Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum in Pittsburgh, was also wounded."

Rose knew just what to do. She helped her baby up right away. The kid was standing on her own within 15 minutes and took her first steps soon after that.\u201d",
      "Rose-Tu and her baby, who is nursing regularly, are doing well, Kelsey Wallace from the zoo's communications team said Tuesday.",
      "The calf is Rose-Tu's third baby. Her firstborn, 16-year-old Samudra, also lives at the zoo. Her second calf, Lily, passed away from a virus in 2018, just before she turned 6 years old.",
      "It might be a while before the new baby and Rose-Tu are ready for visitors. Staff want to make sure the calf continues to do well, and that Rose-Tu is calm and comfortable with people around, Lefave said.",
      "\u201cRose is a fantastic mom,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s so gentle and protective, and the calf is already nursing well. These are signs that they will have a strong bond, which is exactly what we want to see. We\u2019re ready to help if needed, but so far mom and baby are doing just fine on their own.\u201d",
      "The zoo supports a broad range of efforts to help wild elephants, and its elephant care program has spanned over 60 years, according to its statement."

      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products",
      "A sweeping new U.S. tariff on products made in China is expected to increase the prices American consumers pay for a wide array of products, from the ultra-cheap apparel sold on online shopping platforms to toys and electronic devices such as computers and cellphones.",
      "An additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods took effect Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump agreed to pause his threatened tariffs against Mexico and Canada for 30 days. The delay followed negotiations on Trump's demands for the North American nations to take steps to reduce illegal immigration and the flow of drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "After failing to get a similar White House reprieve, China struck back with retaliatory tariffs on some U.S. goods that are set to begin next week.",
      "The sheer volume and variety of the China-made merchandise sold in the U.S. means residents would probably see the prices of many typically inexpensive items tick higher if the tit-for-tat tariffs persist.",
      "These are some of the products most likely to be impacted:",
      "The U.S. imported about $427 billion worth of goods from China in 2023, the most recent year with complete data, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Consumer electronics, including cellphones, computers and other tech accessories, make up the biggest import categories.",
      "China is a dominant production engine for tech gear, including for American companies like Apple that have their products assembled in the country. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, the Consumer Technology Association trade group reported.",
      "The tariffs also may affect how much consumers pay for typically inexpensive clothing, shoes and kitchen items like pots and pans, as well as the big-ticket items, such as appliances, furniture and auto parts.",
      "Jay Salaytah, 43, who runs his own auto repair shop in Detroit, said he bought some pieces of equipment sooner than he might have, anticipating they would cost more if Trump implemented his campaign promise to use import tariffs as a tool to promote U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\u201cI knew the costs were going to go up, and these are manufactured in China,\u201d Salaytah said of a probe test light he purchased before Tuesday's tariff went into effect.",
      "In addition to imposing a new tariff on Chinese imports, Trump\u2019s executive order also suspended a little-known trade exemption that allowed goods worth less than $800 to come into the U.S. duty-free. The order left open the possibility for the loophole to still be used with shipments from other countries.",
      "The trade rule, known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d has existed for nearly a century. It came under greater scrutiny in recent years due to the rapidly growing number of low-cost items coming into the U.S. from China, mainly from prominent China-founded online retailers such as Shein, Temu and Alibaba\u2019s AliExpress.",
      "Former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed a crackdown on the loophole in September, but the rules did not take effect before Biden left office.",
      "Late Tuesday, the U.S. Postal Service announced it is temporarily suspending acceptance of inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice.",
      "Shein and Temu have gained global popularity by offering a quickly updated assortment of ultra-inexpensive clothes, accessories, gifts and gadgets shipped mostly from China, allowing the two e-commerce companies to compete on the home turf of American companies.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon is trying to compete with them through an online storefront that mimics their business model by offering cheap products shipped directly from China.",
      "Chinese exports of low-value packages soared to $66 billion in 2023, up from $5.3 billion in 2018, according to report released last week by the Congressional Research Service. In the U.S., Temu and Shein comprise about 17% of the discount market for fast fashion, toys and other consumer goods, the report said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. Under de minimis, Shein, Temu and AliExpress could bypass taxes collected by customs authorities. But under the changes effective Tuesday, company shipments from China will now be subject to existing duties plus the new 10% tariff imposed by Trump, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of these orders are valued less than $800, which means all or virtually all of them are going to get caught in that,\u201d Youssef Squali, an analyst at Truist Financial, said.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, said he thinks the price increases on platforms like Shein and Temu will be \u201cpretty small\u201d and the products they sell will remain cheap. However, the rule change is likely to result in delivery delays since the packages now have to go through customs, Kaziukenas said.",
      "The new tariffs will also hit third-party sellers on Amazon that import products from China, according to Squali. He expects sellers to eat some of the costs and pass the rest onto customers, which he thinks could result in percentage price increases in the mid-single digits. Other e-commerce sites that host businesses, such as Etsy, are also going to be impacted, Squali said.",
      "Temu, which is owned by China\u2019s PDD Holdings, has previously said its growth did not depend on the de minimis policy. Though most of its products are shipped from China, Temu has been recruiting Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that experts said would allow it to not be as exposed to changes around the trade rule.",
      "In January, China also introduced measures to help cross-border e-commerce build overseas warehousing by offering them tax rebates or tax exemptions",
      "The day after November's U.S. presidential election, Brieane Olson, CEO of teen clothing chain PacSun, went to Hong Kong to meet with factory executives to figure out ways to prepare for Trump\u2019s tariff plan.",

      "The D",
      "WASHINGTON -- The D.C. Council voted unanimously Tuesday to expel Councilmember Trayon White, who faces a federal trial on charges of taking tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to influence city contract decisions.",
      "White, 40, was arrested by the FBI last August. His federal trial won\u2019t start until January 2026, but preliminary evidence shows White pocketing cash-stuffed envelopes from a city contractor-turned-informer.",
      "Tuesday's hearing on the matter was relatively quick. An internal council inquiry had already recommended expulsion. Votes from 11 of the 12 remaining council members were required for expulsion, but the vote was unanimous.",
      "\u201cBribery of elected officials is quintessential corruption,\u201d Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said before the vote. \u201cTrust is precious. Trust is critical for an elected government, and we must act.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s first time in modern D.C. history that the council has expelled a member. Most recently, in 2019, former Councilmember Jack Evans \u2014 facing multiple charges of ethics violations \u2014 resigned ahead of an expulsion vote.",
      "White came up in local politics as a protege of iconic and infamous former Mayor Marion Barry. And White has been channeling his mentor's defiant, populist playbook since his arrest.",
      "He refused to cooperate with the internal council inquiry. His lawyer, Frederick D. Cooke Jr., also served as Barry\u2019s defense attorney. And White has sought to stoke lingering suspicion of the FBI among Black Washingtonians, many of whom believe Barry was unfairly targeted by the 1990 FBI sting that caught him on camera smoking crack cocaine.",
      "During Tuesday's council hearing, White sat silently in the audience surrounded by supporters. Meanwhile, a panel truck sat parked outside the D.C. government building with an electronic display showing a picture of White and the message \u201cFBI set me up.\u201d Another image in the shifting display showed a picture of Mendelson underneath the word \u201cRacist.\u201d",
      "Last week, White showed up at a council hearing on his case wearing a T-shirt that declared \u201cTHE FBI KILLED FRED HAMPTON\u201d \u2014 a reference to the Illinois Black Panther Party leader who was killed during a police raid in 1969.",
      "Even before his legal troubles, White was closely associated with the Barry legacy, frequently appearing at his side later in his life. White represents Ward 8 \u2014 D.C.\u2019s poorest and Blackest district \u2014 in the seat Barry held for years. In 2018, when a statue of Barry was erected outside the D.C. government building, White went on local radio to defend Barry\u2019s legacy against critics.",
      "As a councilmember, White channeled Barry\u2019s street-level style \u2014 building loyalty by personally appearing throughout his ward, especially at crime scenes, at all hours of the day.",
      "\u201cHe was trained by Barry, and Barry would do that. He would show up for everything from a birthday or a barbecue to a shooting scene,\u201d said Robinson Woodward-Burns, a political science professor at Washington\u2019s Howard University.",
      "And in true Barry style, the arrest and strength of evidence did little to dent his popularity; less than three months later he was reelected to a third term in November with limited opposition.",
      "Arrest and public scandal may not be the end of White's political career, much like that of his mentor. White is free to enter the special election that will be called to fill his seat as long as he hasn't been convicted of a felony. His trial starts next year.",
      "George Musgrove, author of \u201c Chocolate City, A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation\u2019s Capital,\u201d said he believes White is making a \u201cfalse comparison\u201d in wrapping himself in the Barry legacy.",
      "Barry boasted a legitimate pre-politics resume as a pioneering civil rights activist, Musgrove said, serving as the first chairman of the seminal Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee before coming to Washington in 1965 to run the local SNCC office. And as mayor, Barry is regarded as having enriched and elevated other Black residents, and partially credited with helping create the robust Black middle class that populates the D.C. area.",
      "\u201cTrayon wants to play that role, but he\u2019s never built up that history,\u201d said Musgrove, a history professor at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. \u201cSo that goodwill is only going to stretch so far.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, Musgrove said he thinks White would have a decent chance of regaining his seat in a special election. In a ward where voter turnout in a nonpresidential election year usually hovers in the teens, he said it would take a strong candidate with broad coalition support to challenge White's organized loyalists.",
      "\u201cWhat he learned from Barry is how to cultivate a relatively small but pretty fervent electoral base in a low-turnout ward,\u201d Musgrove said. \u201cHe only has to mobilize a couple thousand people.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and proposed the U.S. take \u201cownership\u201d in redeveloping the area into \u201cthe Riviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s brazen proposal appears certain to roil the next stage of talks meant to extend the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and secure the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza.",
      "The provocative comments came as talks are ramping up this week with the promise of surging humanitarian aid and reconstruction supplies to help the people of Gaza recover after more than 15 months of devastating conflict. Now Trump wants to push roughly 1.8 million people to leave the land they have called home and claim it for the U.S., perhaps with American troops.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too,\u201d Trump said at an evening news conference with Netanyahu by his side. The president who made his name as a New York real estate developer added: \u201cWe\u2019ll make sure that it\u2019s done world-class. It\u2019ll be wonderful for the people \u2014 Palestinians, Palestinians mostly, we\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Trump outlined his thinking as he held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, where the two leaders also discussed the fragile ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israeli-Hamas conflict and shared concerns about Iran.",
      "Trump said the U.S. would redevelop the territory after Palestinians are resettled elsewhere and turn the territory into a place where the \u201cworld's people\u201d\u2014 including Palestinians \u2014 would live. He offered no detail about what authority the U.S. would use to take the land and develop it.",
      "Egypt, Jordan and other U.S. allies in the Mideast have cautioned Trump that relocating Palestinians from Gaza would threaten Mideast stability, risk expanding the conflict and undermine a decades-long push by the U.S. and allies for a two-state solution.",
      "Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry issued a sharply worded reaction to Trump, noting their long call for an independent Palestinian state was a \u201cfirm, steadfast and unwavering position.\u201d Saudi Arabia has been in negotiations with the U.S. over a deal to diplomatically recognize Israel in exchange for a security pact and other terms.",
      "\u201cThe duty of the international community today is to work to alleviate the severe human suffering endured by the Palestinian people, who will remain committed to their land and will not budge from it,\" the Saudi statement said.",
      "Still, Trump insists the Palestinians \u201chave no alternative\u201d but to leave the \"big pile of rubble\u201d that is Gaza. He spoke out as his top aides stressed that a three-to-five-year timeline for reconstruction of the war-torn territory, as laid out in a temporary truce agreement, is not viable.",
      "Last week, both Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah II dismissed Trump's calls to resettle Gazans.",
      "But Trump said he believes Egypt and Jordan \u2014 as well as other countries, which he did not name \u2014 will ultimately agree to take in Palestinians.",
      "\u201cYou look over the decades, it\u2019s all death in Gaza,\u201d Trump said. \"This has been happening for years. It\u2019s all death. If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people, permanently, in nice homes where they can be happy and not be shot and not be killed and not be knifed to death like what\u2019s happening in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Trump also said he isn\u2019t ruling out deploying U.S. troops to support reconstruction of Gaza. He envisions \u201clong-term\u201d U.S. ownership of a redevelopment of the territory.",
      "The president's proposal was greeted with alarm by Democrats and a measure of skepticism by his Republican allies.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s completely lost it,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. \u201cHe wants a U.S. invasion of Gaza, which would cost thousands of American lives and set the Middle East on fire for 20 years? It\u2019s sick.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what our Arab friends say about that,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a Trump ally. \"And I think most South Carolinians are probably not excited about sending Americans to take over Gaza. I think that might be problematic, but I\u2019ll keep an open mind.\u201d",
      "The White House's focus on the future of Gaza comes as the nascent truce between Israel and Hamas hangs in the balance.",
      "Netanyahu is facing competing pressure from his right-wing coalition to end a temporary truce against Hamas militants in Gaza and from war-weary Israelis who want the remaining hostages home and for the 15-month conflict to end.",
      "Trump may be betting he can persuade Egypt and Jordan to come around to accept displaced Palestinians because of the significant aid that the U.S. provides Cairo and Amman. Hard-line right-wing members of Netanyahu\u2019s government have embraced the call to move displaced Palestinians out of Gaza.",
      "\u201cTo me, it is unfair to explain to Palestinians that they might be back in five years,\u201d Trump\u2019s Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, said. \u201cThat\u2019s just preposterous.\u201d",
      "Trump also signaled that he may be reconsidering an independent Palestinian state as part of a broader two-state solution to the decades-long Israel-Palestinian conflict.",
      "\u201cWell, a lot of plans change with time,\u201d he told reporters when asked if he was still committed to a plan like the one he laid out in 2020 that called for a Palestinian state. \u201cA lot of death has occurred since I left and now came back.\"",
      "Netanyahu's arrival in Washington for the first foreign leader visit of Trump's second term coincides with the prime minister's popular support sagging.",
      "The prime minister is in the middle of weekslong testimony in an ongoing corruption trial that centers on allegations he exchanged favors with media moguls and wealthy associates. He has decried the accusations and said he is the victim of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "Being seen with Trump, who is popular in Israel, could help distract the public from the trial and boost Netanyahu\u2019s standing.",
      "\u201cWe have the right leader of Israel who\u2019s done a great job,\" Trump said of Netanyahu.",
      "Netanyahu praised Trump's leadership in getting the hostage and ceasefire deal. The prime minister also spoke glowingly of Trump thinking outside the box.",
      "\u201cYou say things others refuse to say. And after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, 'You know he\u2019s right.'\"",
      "Hamas in a statement decried Trump\u2019s comments.",
      "\u201cWe reject Trump\u2019s statements in which he said that the residents of the Gaza Strip have no choice but to leave, and we consider them a recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region,\" the group said.",
      "Netanyahu met with White House national security adviser Mike Waltz and Witkoff on Monday to begin the daunting work of brokering the next phase of a ceasefire agreement.",
      "The Israeli leader said he would send a delegation to Qatar to continue indirect talks with Hamas that are being mediated by the Gulf Arab country, the first confirmation that those negotiations would continue. Netanyahu also said he would convene his security Cabinet to discuss Israel\u2019s demands for the next phase of the ceasefire when he returns to Israel at the end of the week.",
      "Witkoff, meanwhile, said he plans to meet with Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, in Florida on Thursday to discuss the next phase in the ceasefire. Qatar and Egypt have served as key intermediaries with Hamas throughout the conflict.",
      "Netanyahu is under intense pressure from hard-right members of his governing coalition to abandon the ceasefire and resume fighting in Gaza to eliminate Hamas. Bezalel Smotrich, one of Netanyahu\u2019s key partners, vows to topple the government if the war isn\u2019t relaunched, a step that could lead to early elections.",
      "Hamas, which has reasserted control over Gaza since the ceasefire began last month, has said it will not release hostages in the second phase without an end to the war and Israeli forces\u2019 full withdrawal. Netanyahu, meanwhile, maintains that Israel is committed to victory over Hamas and the return of all hostages captured in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war.",

      "SANTA ANA, Calif. -- A lawsuit filed this week accuses the University of California of racial discrimination in undergraduate admissions by favoring Black and Latino students over Asian American and white applicants.",
      "A group called Students Against Racial Discrimination sued Monday in federal court, alleging the university system admits students with inferior academic credentials at the expense of better-qualified ones.",
      "The complaint claims UC's admissions practices violate a state law approved by voters in 1996 that forbids considering race and other factors in public education, public employment and public contracting.",
      "In addition, the filing alleges that the California campuses are violating the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars federal funds recipients from discriminating based on race.",
      "UC officials didn't immediately respond Tuesday to emails and phone calls seeking comment on the lawsuit.",

      "Asian American and white applicants are discriminated against because of their race, while Latino and Black students are \u201coften placed at a significant academic disadvantage, and thus experience worse outcomes, because of the university\u2019s use of racial preferences,\" the complaint alleges.",

Lindsey Graham, one of President Donald Trump's closest congressional allies, is kicking off his pursuit of a fifth term with two of his home state's top Republicans chairing his 2026 campaign, an early show of strength in a race where the longtime lawmaker is expected to face primary challengers.",
      "Graham's campaign told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Sen. Tim Scott and Gov. Henry McMaster will chair his 2026 run.

    "summary": "San Francisco&rsquo;s Board of Supervisors appears ready to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers to expedite the city&rsquo;s response to its fentanyl and homelessness crisis",

      "San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors appears ready to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers to expedite the city\u2019s response to its fentanyl and homelessness crisis",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco's Board of Supervisors is poised to grant newly elected Mayor Daniel Lurie greater powers and flexibility to expedite the city's response to a fentanyl crisis that has turned sidewalks into open-air dens of drug consumption and homelessness.",
      "The legislation, which supervisors will vote on Tuesday, eliminates competitive bidding requirements for some contracts and allows the administration to solicit private donations to quickly add 1,500 shelter beds and hire more public safety and behavioral health specialists. It is the first piece of legislation for Lurie, a Levi Strauss heir and anti-poverty nonprofit founder who had never held elective office until he squashed Mayor London Breed's reelection bid last year.",
      "The proposal already has the six votes needed to pass, and will likely pick up more votes Tuesday.",
      "The 11-member board relinquishing oversight powers for an effort with no concrete plan or accountability metrics underscores how desperate supervisors are for a solution. It also signals their embrace \u2014 for now \u2014 of a political outsider who pledged to work collaboratively to create common-sense solutions.",
      "Supervisor Connie Chan said last week at the budget and finance committee she chairs that board oversight helps ensure taxpayer money is spent judiciously and transparently. But she also said this is \u201ctruly an unprecedented time\" that calls for unusual measures, and she appreciated the mayor's willingness to compromise. Breed had a frosty relationship with the board's progressive members, Chan included.",
      "San Francisco has long been known for its liberal politics, but homeless tent encampments and public drug use surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overdose deaths fueled by cheap and potent fentanyl reached a record high in San Francisco of over 800 in 2023.",
      "In response, frustrated residents voted to enhance police powers and backed crackdowns on street homelessness. They also elected more moderate Democrats to the board.",
      "Lurie's proposal would allow the city to bypass the competitive bidding and procurement process for contracts, grants and leases related to addiction, homelessness and public safety hiring. City departments could sign new leases without board approval. He wants to open a 24-hour drop-off center that would be friendly to police and an alternative to jail.",
      "Supervisors would have only 45 days to vote on contracts up to $25 million \u2014 down from the original $50 million proposed by the mayor \u2014 or relinquish their oversight. Expedited contracting would sunset in one year, down from the original five.",
      "San Francisco AIDS Foundation opposes the proposal because it lacks metrics and details, such as how it would actually reduce fentanyl use, said Laura Thomas, the nonprofit's drug policy expert and senior director of HIV & harm reduction policy.",
      "She applauds the mayor's desire for more housing and treatment services but hopes he will not endorse policies forcing people into treatment, which has shown to be ineffective and often counterproductive.",
      "\u201cWe want to know more about what the proposal is,\u201d Thomas said Monday. \u201cWe're raising notes of concern and we want to know more information before we can support it.\u201d",
      "At Wednesday's budget and finance committee, legislative analyst Nicolas Menard warned that waiving competitive bids would likely increase service costs and \u201ccreate opportunities for waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d The fiscal impact is unknown, but the grants and contracts budget for the affected city departments totals just over $1 billion.",
      "\u201cI need to be very clear that you\u2019re giving up a lot here,\" he said.",
      "Still, it passed out of committee to the full board with a unanimous recommendation and in a statement released later that day, Lurie said that with the ordinance \u201cwe are no longer looking the other way \u2014 we are treating the fentanyl crisis like the emergency it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a new era in City Hall.\u201d"

      "Richard T. Snyder, who had been a justice of the Petersburgh Town Court for about a decade, left his post after being charged with misconduct by a state judicial commission, officials said Tuesday.",
      "According to court transcripts, Snyder tried to avoid serving on a jury in 2023 by first identifying himself as a judge and then saying, \u201cI know everybody come in front of me. I know they are guilty. They would not be in front of me.\u201d",

      "In a statement, Robert H. Tembeckjian, administrator of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct, said \"there is no place on the bench for someone who so deeply misunderstands the role of a judge and the administration of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is bad enough that a judge would seek to avoid such a fundamental civic responsibility as jury service. It is astounding that the judge would claim an inability to be impartial, and to declare under oath that the accused must be guilty or they would not be in court,\" he said.",
      "Courts in New York do not offer automatic jury duty exemptions to anyone, including judges."

    "story": [
      "Maryland officials have unveiled their designs for replacing Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge almost a year after it collapsed under the weight of a cargo ship that lost power and veered off course",
      "SPARROWS POINT, Md. -- Almost a year after the deadly collapse of Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge, Maryland officials on Tuesday unveiled their designs for its replacement, which will be taller and better protected against ship strikes.",
      "Construction of the state\u2019s first cable-stayed bridge could be completed in 2028 and cost upwards of $1.7 billion.",
      "With its graceful outline and delicate design, officials said the new bridge will modernize Baltimore\u2019s skyline, becoming a symbol of resilience, progress and economic growth. The design features two towers with cables radiating down to the deck.",
      "\u201cThis is a great day for the state of Maryland,\u201d Gov. Wes Moore said at a news conference late Tuesday morning. \u201cBut it\u2019s not lost on me that today\u2019s triumph was born out of tragedy.\u201d",
      "The original Key Bridge, a 1.6-mile (2.6-kilometer) steel span at the mouth of Baltimore\u2019s harbor, took five years to construct and opened to traffic in 1977. It connected various port-oriented industrial communities around Baltimore and allowed drivers to easily bypass downtown.",
      "The bridge was destroyed when a massive container ship lost power and slammed into one of its supporting columns. The March 26 collapse killed six construction workers who were filling potholes when the structure crumbled beneath them. Baltimore\u2019s port was closed for months after the collapse, and increased traffic congestion remains a problem for drivers across the region.",
      "Officials quickly promised to rebuild the bridge \u2014 a longstanding Baltimore landmark and vital piece of transportation infrastructure.",
      "Demolition of the remaining pieces will take place this spring, with construction of its replacement to follow, officials said Tuesday.",
      "They held Tuesday\u2019s news conference at Tradepoint Atlantic, a shipping hub in the Port of Baltimore that played a major role in cleanup and recovery efforts following the collapse. The facility is revitalizing the site of a former Bethlehem Steel plant just northeast of Baltimore as maritime shipping continues to fuel the regional economy.",
      "\u201cMaryland is a bridge between America and the rest of the world. We get cars from Michigan out to market. We bring sugars and spices to Louisiana. We haul farm equipment from the East Coast deep into the heartland,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCommerce and trade are the bedrock of our state, and we will continue to make investments that honor our tradition.\u201d",
      "In August, the state awarded a $73 million contract for the first phase of the rebuild to Kiewit Infrastructure, a major construction and engineering firm.",
      "Officials said the project would advance in two phases, with the first focusing on the design work and other necessary steps before construction begins. Moore promised to \u201cemploy many Marylanders\u201d throughout the process.",
      "Maryland Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld said the design will include the latest in pier protection technology, which has become increasingly important as ships keep getting bigger and carrying more cargo. The bridge will also be taller to provide more clearance. He said the plans were developed with the project\u2019s cost and construction timeline in mind.",
      "\u201cWhile this is a beautiful bridge, it will also be a working bridge for a working city,\u201d Wiedefeld said.",
      "The federal government has agreed to cover the full price tag for rebuilding. Congress recently passed a spending bill that included a funding provision for the project.",
      "Officials have said they expect that federal taxpayers will eventually be made whole through insurance payouts and damages, but that could take a while. A sprawling civil case will ultimately determine the assignments of liability in what could become one of the most expensive maritime disasters in U.S. history.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has not yet released its final report on the collapse, though officials said a loose cable in the ship\u2019s electrical switchboard likely contributed to its power issues. Federal agents boarded the cargo ship Dali amid a criminal investigation last year."

      "The U.S. transportation secretary has visited the site of a medical transportation plane crash in Philadelphia with city and state officials",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The impact area where a medical transportation plane crashed in Philadelphia was notably \u201cexpansive,\u201d U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday after viewing the site with investigators and city officials.",
      "Duffy said he was struck by \u201chow expansive it was. And the issues that fire and police were dealing with. Again, this is a very populated area.\u201d",
      "The crash Friday evening killed all six people on the Learjet 55 air ambulance, including a girl who had been receiving medical treatment at Shriners Children\u2019s Philadelphia hospital. A seventh person inside a vehicle was killed on the ground.",
      "Mayor Cherelle Parker said two more people who were hurt on the ground have been identified, bringing the total to 24. Four people remained hospitalized Monday, two in critical condition.",
      "Parker said footage of the crash has made her \u201cthink about what could have been, had a gas line been hit.\u201d",
      "The air ambulance was taking Valentina Guzm\u00e1n Murillo and her mother, Lizeth Murillo Osuna, home to Mexico. It plummeted within a minute of taking off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport.",
      "Debris from the crash exploded into a fireball, and pieces of the plane were blown into the residential and commercial Castor Gardens neighborhood, severely damaging several businesses and at least 11 homes.",
      "\u201cIt was a very steep angle at which that aircraft came down,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "The aircraft\u2019s cockpit voice recorder, recovered about 8 feet (2.4 meters) beneath the ground's surface, was on its way to be examined in Washington, D.C., Duffy said. He said the plane did not have a data recorder, but investigators are hoping to retrieve flight data from the jet\u2019s ground proximity warning system.",
      "\u201cInformation can come off that device, whether it\u2019s the speed or location of the aircraft. We will be able to get some data, hopefully, off that device,\u201d he said.",
      "The Philadelphia crash occurred two days after the deadliest U.S. air disaster in a generation, when an American Airlines jet with 60 passengers and four crew members collided in midair in Washington, D.C., with an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers.",
      "The girl who died in the Philadelphia crash had recently completed treatment for a condition not easily treated in Mexico, hospital officials have said. Others killed in the plane were neonatologist Dr. Ra\u00fal Meza of the State of Mexico near Mexico City and copilot Josu\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez of Veracruz.",
      "Audio recorded by LiveATC captured an air traffic controller at Northeast Philadelphia Airport telling \u201cMedevac Medservice 056\u201d to turn right when departing. About 30 seconds later, the controller repeats the request before asking, \u201cYou on frequency?\u201d Minutes later the controller says, \u201cWe have a lost aircraft. We\u2019re not exactly sure what happened, so we\u2019re trying to figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.\u201d"

      "In the heart of thriving Oklahoma City lies a more than 100-year-old relic to the city's western heritage: one of the largest cattle stockyards in the world",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- On the edge of a thriving downtown dotted with luxury hotels and trendy restaurants is a more than 100-year-old relic of Oklahoma City's western heritage: One of the world's largest cattle stockyards.",
      "But maybe not for much longer.",
      "The Oklahoma National Stockyards \u2014 the last big-city stockyard in the U.S. \u2014 is for sale. The $27 million price tag includes 100 acres (40 hectares) of prime property along the Oklahoma River in a growing city of roughly 700,000 residents, where a state-of-the-art NBA arena is set to break ground and a developer is pushing plans for the country's tallest skyscraper.",
      "Although the stockyard's owners are hopeful a buyer will keep the cattle coming, they acknowledge the land is attractive for redevelopment.",
      "The sale is a sign of the times for livestock auctions and America's cattle market, a volatile industry squeezed in recent years by drought, higher production costs and the lowest number of cattle in the U.S. since the 1950s.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on imported goods has created uncertainty in the industry, although the potential impact is not yet clear. The U.S. is the world's largest producer of beef but is still a net beef importer, with Canada and Mexico among the top countries accounting for U.S. beef imports.",
      "The number of cattle moving through the maze of wooden pens in Oklahoma City is down roughly 20% over the past two years, said Jerry Reynolds, the stockyard's president.",
      "The same family has owned the grounds since 1910, but Reynolds said younger generations of the owners are simply not interested in overseeing a major stockyard and the daily grind that entails: a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week operation with tens of thousands of animals auctioned every week and a seemingly endless maintenance to-do list.",
      "\u201cThe handwriting has kind of been on the wall for a long time, as the cities grow and surround these facilities,\u201d said Derrell Peel, a professor at Oklahoma State University who studies cattle markets. \u201cNot only is that a prime piece of real estate, but the increasing challenges, the environmental challenges, of operating a stockyard in a major city, is pretty tricky.\u201d",
      "The stockyard went on the market in October and the current owners do not have a timetable for completing the sale.",
      "As many as 10,000 head of cattle still rumble each week through the stockyard, an urban survivor in an industry that is largely now scattered across rural America. One of the largest stocker/feeder cattle markets in the world, the Oklahoma City grounds are the last of the so-called \u201cterminal markets\u201d that dotted the Midwest, where cattle were shipped, sold, slaughtered and then processed at nearby packing houses.",
      "In the mid-20th century, such stockyards thrived in bigger cities including Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, Nebraska, and Fort Worth, Texas. But with the advent of refrigeration and the increasing value of those properties in urban centers, they slowly transitioned to more rural areas closer to feedlots and meatpacking plants, according to Peel, a professor of agricultural economics.",
      "If Oklahoma City's stockyard is shuttered, an auction market in Joplin, Missouri, would likely claim the title of the largest in the country, Peel said. That stockyard, a little more than 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Oklahoma City, as well as another large facility just west of the metro in El Reno, Oklahoma, would pick up much of the business, he said.",
      "\u201cAs a member of the family that began the yards and has been involved throughout our entire 115-year history, obviously I have some feelings about the outcome there,\" said Chris Bakwin, chairman of the stockyard's board and one of the major shareholders in the company founded by his great-grandfather. \u201cBut I have to do what\u2019s best for shareholders.\u201d",
      "The stockyard's pens are set up on the original bricks laid during its construction more than a century ago. From a metal catwalk that runs over the stockyard, visitors can hear the thundering sound of hoofs and the yells of cowboys on horseback leading them into pens or running a few at a time into a small, tightly packed arena where buyers signal their interest to a fast-talking auctioneer.",
      "On a recent January morning, rancher Garrison Duke, his wife Pamela, and their children, Pecos, 3, and 1-year-old Sterling, hauled a trailer full of cattle from their ranch in Lexington, on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.",
      "Duke was a boy when he first started going to the stockyard with his father and, on a good trip, they would leave town with a full stomach after a steak dinner and perhaps a new pair of boots.",
      "\u201cIt was just always a thrill, getting to see all the cattle and how they all handled them, seeing them sell and my dad get a big paycheck at the end of the year. It was good for everybody,\" Duke said. \u201cNow we're trying to keep the kids a part of it all.\"",
      "Adjacent to the stockyard is a business district filled with shops boasting western charm: Shorty's Hattery, National Saddlery, western wear stores and popular steakhouses. The area has become a tourist destination for travelers seeking a bit of Americana in the U.S. heartland.",
      "Oklahoma City's population grew by 3% over the past few years, according to the Census Bureau, making it the nation's 20th largest city.",
      "And while other stockyards in major cities have gone away, largely because of the increasing value of urban land, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt said he believes the stockyard can coexist in the center of a booming city.",
      "\u201cI do, probably for no other reason but that Oklahoma City is so geographically large,\" Holt said. \u201cIt's not like the stockyards is in midtown Manhattan.\u201d",
      "Still, there is some fear among those who make their living at the stockyard that a buyer could have a different vision in mind.",
      "\u201cThere definitely is,\u201d said Jason Baker, who owns one of the nine commission firms that buy and sell cattle at the stockyard. \u201cIt's very vital for my family. It's our livelihood.\""

      "Punxsutawney Phil's team of top-hatted associates will issue the woodchuck's weather verdict as the sun rises on Sunday, telling the world whether he is predicting wintry conditions for the next six weeks or the relief of an early spring.",
      "The annual ritual goes back more than a century in western Pennsylvania, with far older roots in European folklore, but it took Bill Murray's 1993 movie to transform it into what it is today, with tens of thousands of revelers at the scene and imitators scattered around the United States and beyond.",
      "Last year's crowd may have been a record and organizers are bracing for a similar turnout on Sunday.",
      "If the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club members declare Phil did not see his shadow, that is said to usher in an early spring. If he does see it, it's six more weeks of winter, although what that means can be subjective.",
      "Phil has predicted a longer winter far more often than an early spring, and one effort to track his accuracy concluded he was right less than half the time.",
      "Tom Dunkel, president of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, says there are two types of people who make the trek to Gobbler's Knob: the faithful seeking to validate their beliefs and the doubters who want to confirm their skepticism.",
      "Phil communicates his forecast through \u201cGroundhog-ese\u201d with the help of a special cane that Dunkel has inherited as the club's leader. It's not as if he speaks in English words.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll like wink, he\u2019ll purr, he\u2019ll chatter, he\u2019ll \u2014 you know \u2014 nod,\u201d Dunkel said.",
      "Attendance is free but it costs $5 to take a bus and avoid a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) trek from the middle of town to the stage where the prediction is made, some 80 miles (123 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh. The need for so many buses is why the local schools, where the sports mascot is the Chucks, close when Groundhog Day falls on a weekday.",
      "A new welcome center opened four years ago and the club is working on an elaborate second living space for Phil and family so they can split time between Gobbler's Knob and Phil's longtime home at the town library. The club also is putting up large video screens and more powerful speakers this year to help attendees in the back of the crowd follow the proceedings.",
      "\"It\u2019s a holiday where you don\u2019t really owe anyone anything,\u201d said A.J. Dereume, who among the club's 15-member inner circle serves as Phil's handler. \u201cYou\u2019re grasping onto the belief, you know, in something that\u2019s just fun to believe in.\u201d",
      "Phil has a wife, Punxsutawney Phyllis, and two pups born this spring, Shadow and Sunny, although his family won't join him on stage for the big event. The groundhog family eats fruits and vegetables, get daily visits from Dereume and see a veterinarian at least once a year.",
      "The club's lore is that Phil is the same woodchuck who has been issuing weather forecasts for the past century, thanks to an \u201celixir of life\u201d that keeps him immortal.",
      "\u201cThere's only one Phil, and it's not something that can be handed down,\u201d Dunkel said. \u201cJust like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny, there's only one.\u201d",
      "Groundhog Day celebrations, formal and informal, are being held in many Pennsylvania towns and elsewhere on Sunday. There have been Groundhog Day events in at least 28 U.S. states and Canadian provinces."

      "The American Airlines flight, with 64 people on board was preparing to land from Wichita, Kansas. The Army Black Hawk helicopter was on a training mission and had three soldiers on board. Both aircraft plunged to the Potomac River after colliding.",
      "The plane\u2019s passengers included figure skaters returning from the 2025 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas, and a group of hunters returning from a guided trip.",
      "Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia; Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland; and Cpt. Rebecca M. Lobach, of Durham, North Carolina, were killed in the helicopter.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Saturday that preliminary data showed conflicting readings about the altitudes of the airliner and the Army helicopter.",
      "Investigators also said that about a second before impact, the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed a change in its pitch. But they did not say whether that change in angle meant that pilots were trying to perform an evasive maneuver to avoid the crash.",
      "Data from the jet\u2019s flight recorder showed its altitude as 325 feet (99 meters), plus or minus 25 feet (7.6 meters), when the crash happened Wednesday night, NTSB officials told reporters. Data in the control tower, though, showed the Black Hawk at 200 feet (61 meters), the maximum allowed altitude for helicopters in the area.",
      "The discrepancy has yet to be explained.",
      "Investigators said they hoped to reconcile the difference with data from the helicopter\u2019s black box, which is taking more time to retrieve because it became waterlogged after the Black Hawk plunged into the Potomac. They also said they plan to refine the tower data, which can be less reliable.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what our job is, to figure that out,\u201d NTSB member Todd Inman said.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex investigation,\u201d investigator in charge Brice Banning said. \u201cThere are a lot of pieces here. Our team is working hard to gather this data.\u201d",
      "Banning said the jet\u2019s cockpit voice recorder captured sound moments before the crash.",
      "\u201cThe crew had a verbal reaction,\u201d Banning said, and the flight data recorder showed \u201cthe airplane beginning to increase its pitch. Sounds of impact were audible about one second later, followed by the end of the recording.\u201d",
      "Full NTSB investigations typically take at least a year, though investigators hope to have a preliminary report within 30 days.",
      "Inman said he spent hours meeting with victims\u2019 families since the crash. The families are struggling, Inman said.",
      "\u201cSome wanted to give us hugs. Some are just mad and angry,\u201d Inman said. \u201cThey are just all hurt. And they still want answers, and we want to give them answers.\u201d",
      "The remains of 42 people had been pulled from the river as of Saturday afternoon, including 38 that have been positively identified, officials said. They expect to recover all of the remains, though the plane\u2019s fuselage will probably have to be pulled from the water to get the rest.",
      "More than 300 responders were taking part in the recovery effort at a given time, officials said. Two Navy salvage barges were also deployed to lift heavy wreckage.",
      "On Fox News Sunday, Duffy said the Federal Aviation Administration was looking into staffing in the Reagan Airport control tower.",
      "Investigators said there were five controllers on duty at the time of the crash: a local controller, ground controller, assistant controller, a supervisor and supervisor in training.",
      "According to an FAA report obtained by The Associated Press, one controller was responsible for helicopter and plane traffic. Those duties are often divided between two people but the airport typically combines them at 9:30 p.m., once traffic slows down. On Wednesday, the tower supervisor combined them earlier, which the report called \u201cnot normal.\u201d",
      "\u201cStaffing shortages for air traffic control has been a major problem for years and years,\u201d Duffy said, promising that President Donald Trump\u2019s administration would address shortages with \u201cbright, smart, brilliant people in towers controlling airspace.\u201d",
      "With the nation already grieving, an air ambulance crashed in Philadelphia on Friday, killing all six people on board, including a child returning home to Mexico from treatment, and at least one person on the ground.",
      "Also Friday, the FAA heavily restricted helicopter traffic around Reagan National, hours after Trump claimed on social media that the Army helicopter had been flying higher than allowed.",
      "\u201cIt was far above the 200-foot limit. That\u2019s not really too complicated to understand, is it???\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s crash was the deadliest in the U.S. since Nov. 12, 2001, when a jet slammed into a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens, just after takeoff from Kennedy Airport. The crash killed all 260 people on board and five people on the ground.",
      "Experts regularly highlight that plane travel is overwhelmingly safe, but the crowded airspace around Reagan National can challenge even the most experienced pilots.",

      "U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley agreed Friday to end Tommy Thompson's sentence on the civil contempt charge, saying he \u201cno longer is convinced that further incarceration is likely to coerce compliance.\u201d However, he also ordered that the research scientist immediately start serving a two-year sentence he received for a related criminal contempt charge, a term that was delayed when the civil contempt term was imposed.",
      "Thompson has been held in contempt of court since Dec. 15, 2015, and also incurred a daily fine of $1,000. In his ruling, Marbley assessed Thompson\u2019s total civil contempt fine at $3,335,000.",
      "Thompson\u2019s case dates to his discovery of the S.S. Central America, known as the Ship of Gold, in 1988. The gold rush-era ship sank in a hurricane off South Carolina in 1857 with thousands of pounds of gold aboard, contributing to an economic panic.",
      "Despite an investor lawsuit and a federal court order, Thompson still won\u2019t cooperate with authorities trying to find 500 coins minted from some of the gold, according to court records. He has previously said, without providing details, that the coins \u2014 valued at about $2.5 million \u2014 were turned over to a trust in Belize.",
      "After Thompson failed to appear for a 2012 Ohio hearing to discuss the coins, U.S. marshals eventually tracked him to Florida in 2015 and arrested him. He pleaded guilty in April 2015 to skipping that hearing and was given the two-year prison sentence.",
      "Federal law generally limits jail time for contempt of court to 18 months. But a federal appeals court in 2019 rejected Thompson\u2019s argument that that law applies to him, saying his refusal violated conditions of a plea agreement."

      "North Korea has lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned that such remarks will never contribute to U.S. interests",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In its first direct criticism of the Trump administration, North Korea lashed out at U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio for calling it a \u201crogue\u201d state and warned Monday that such \u201ccoarse and nonsensical remarks\u201d will never contribute to U.S. interests.",
      "The statement is the latest in a series of North Korean signals that it will maintain its tough stance on the U.S. for now, though Trump has said he\u2019s intent on reaching out to its leader Kim Jong Un to revive diplomacy.",
      "\u201cThe hostile words and deeds of the person who is in charge of the U.S. foreign policy served as an occasion of confirming once again the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK which remains unchanged,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said, using the acronym of the country's official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s coarse and nonsensical remarks only show directly the incorrect view of the new U.S. administration on the DPRK and will never help promote the U.S. interests as he wishes,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement took issue with what the ministry called Rubio\u2019s branding of North Korea as a \u201crogue\u201d state in a media interview. It likely referred to Rubio\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d on Jan. 30, in which he called North Korea and Iran \u201crogue states\u201d as he addressed foreign policy challenges.",
      "It was not the first time for U.S. officials to describe North Korea as a rogue state. But the North\u2019s latest statement suggests the country won\u2019t likely quickly embrace Trump\u2019s overture.",
      "During a Fox News interview broadcast on Jan. 23, Trump called Kim \u201ca smart guy\u201d and \u201cnot a religious zealot.\u201d Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again, Trump replied, \u201cI will, yeah.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments raised prospects for a possible revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea, as Trump met Kim three times during his first term to discuss how to end Kim's nuclear program. Their earlier high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 broke down due to disputes over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea, but Trump has still repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim.",
      "North Korea hasn\u2019t directly responded to Trump\u2019s interview comments. But it has maintained its confrontational rhetoric against the U.S. and continued its weapons testing activities. Last week, Kim visited a facility to produce nuclear materials and called for boosting North Korea\u2019s nuclear capability in the face of what he called challenges posed by \u201chostile forces,\u201d an apparent reference to the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Many experts say Kim likely thinks he now has greater leverage than before because of his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia.",
      "The previous diplomacy with Trump likely gave Kim a propaganda coup for winning the much-needed recognition of his government on the world stage. But the eventual collapse of diplomacy was still a huge embarrassment.",
      "Kim has since then focused on perfecting nuclear-capable missiles targeting the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "Last November, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington\u2019s \u201cunchangeable\u201d hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats. During a key political meeting in December, Kim vowed to implement the \u201ctoughest\u201d anti-U.S. policy.",

      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "The boss of the Dover Port Health Authority said illegal meat, which has not been through proper health checks, was now available on \"most high streets\" in the UK.",
      "European outbreaks of deadly animal diseases in recent months have left health authorities, Whitehall officials and many in the farming industry worried about the threat they pose to the UK.",

      "Instead, drivers are ordered to travel 22 miles (35km) away to a border control post at Sevington.",
      "But critics have warned that many lorries are simply failing to turn up for the checks, due to a lack of enforcement.",
      "Parliament's Environment Select Committee has now launched an inquiry into whether the system is working.",
      "Lucy Manzano, head of the Dover Port Health Authority, told MPs on the committee that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had been overstating the effectiveness of the system.",
      "She said: \"Defra have continually stated that there are robust controls in place. There are not. They don't exist.\"",
      "She added that the department had failed to provide \"any confirmation of how food would be controlled at the point it arrives, or more importantly, between the point it arrives and the inspection facility that is accessed 22 miles across\".",
      "Ms Manzano said she had presented evidence to the government \"to demonstrate that the system brought in place to safeguard this country from a biosecurity point of view\u2026 is not working\".",

      "Almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat seized at port",

      "Ms Manzano claimed illegal meat has now become much more commonplace in high street shops - and that it is becoming increasingly difficult for consumers to spot if the product they are buying has gone through proper health checks.",
      "It is understood that the view inside Defra is that the post-Brexit checks are working as they should.",
      "Earlier this week figures showed that almost 100 tonnes of illegal meat was seized at the Port of Dover last year.",
      "Defra said the government \"will never waver in its duty to protect the UK's biosecurity\" and insisted it was working effectively with enforcement agencies.",
      "A BBC News investigation last year found that unprecedented levels of seizures had sparked fears of more organised criminal activity.",
      "A similar health check facility to the one at Sevington does exist on site at Dover, but it is understood that the government chose not to use it because of worries about potential traffic queues forming at the border.",
      "Ms Manzano said that decision was \"not based on biosecurity\" and added that \"the very purpose of import controls is to keep the bad stuff out and contain it at first point of entry\".",
      "Last month the UK government introduced strict restrictions on the import of German meat, following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But Ms Manzano said failures in the IT system introduced since Brexit meant that products which should have been undergoing checks were allowed to freely enter the UK for \"at least six days\".",
      "When the current system was introduced last year, the government also gave funding to Dover Port Health Authority to carry out spot checks on smaller vehicles directly at the border.",
      "Figures show the vast majority of illegal meat seized in the UK is caught through those spot checks.",
      "But Ms Manzano said that funding was due to run out in seven weeks and that without further government cash the checks would have to stop.",
      "Government discussions are ongoing about how to best fund border checks.",
      "It is understood the decision to put the checks at Sevington has likely had a direct negative impact on how much money goes to the Dover Port Health Authority.",

    "story": [
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated after China hit back against the introduction of tariffs by the US with measures of its own.",
      "Beijing has set out to target specific American goods with retaliatory taxes, among other measures, following the blanket 10% tariff introduced by President Donald Trump on all Chinese imports to the US.",
      "In some ways, this latest tit-for-tat is nothing new and builds on the long-running trade dispute between the nations, with tariffs having already been imposed and threatened on various goods since 2018.",
      "Trump has said he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so a deal could yet be struck. But if China proceeds with its response on 10 February as planned, what could the impact be?",
      "Coal, oil and gas",
      "Part of China's countermeasures to Trump's tariffs is to announce import taxes of its own on US coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 10%, and a 15% charge on crude oil.",
      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",
      "Rebecca Harding, a trade economist and chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security think tank, said China could easily source more supplies from Russia, where it has already been buying oil on the cheap as the Kremlin seeks to fund its war effort.",

      "Agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks and big cars",
      "As well as fuel, China has slapped a 10% tariff on agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks, and some large cars.",
      "But China is not a big importer of US pick-ups and it gets most of its cars from Europe and Japan, so a 10% tariff on an already small number of imports would not hit consumers too hard.",
      "In recent years, China has increased investments in farm machinery to enhance production and reduce reliance on imports, and to strengthen its food security.",
      "So the introduction of tariffs on agricultural machinery might be another move to try to boost domestic industry.",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at consultancy Capital Economics, said all the tariff measures were \"fairly modest, at least relative to US moves\".",
      "He suggests that China's targeted goods represent about $20bn (\u00a316bn) worth of annual imports - around 12% of China's total imports from the US.",
      "\"This is a far cry from the more than $450bn worth of Chinese goods being targeted by the US.\"",

      "The company still has some business presence in the country through providing apps and games to the Chinese markets by working with local developers.",

      "The list, which has other US firms on it, was created in 2020 by Beijing amid the heating up of trade tensions.",
      "For Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, being on China's list will make it harder to do business in the country. They may face sanctions, including fines, and having the work visas of their foreign employees revoked.",

    "summary": "Are we seeing the opening moves in a wider trade war, and what are the potential economic consequences?",
    "story": [
      "Just a day ago, Donald Trump was threatening a multi-front trade war with Canada, Mexico and China that would take the global economy into uncharted territory.",
      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 18:32:13 GMT",
    "summary": "How might the UK be affected by Trump's tariffs, even if they are not imposed on the UK?",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has been unclear about whether he will impose tariffs on the UK but  economists warn there are still ways Britain could be negatively affected by the president's wider trade policies even if it avoids being hit directly.",
      "The impact could be felt through slower growth in some of the UK's important trading partners. Industrial exports could be diverted from the US and flood the UK market and there could be impacts on our financial markets, including a possible increase to borrowing costs.",
      "Asked about future tariffs, Trump told the BBC on Sunday night: \"The UK is way out of line but I'm sure that one\u2026 I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "The president did not specify in which way he regarded the UK as being \"out of line\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given for imposing tariffs on countries is they have a trade surplus with the US - in other words they sell more to the US than they import from America.",
      "He has claimed these trade surpluses amount to \"massive subsidies that we're giving to Canada and to Mexico\".",
      "The tariffs on Mexico were paused for a month by Trump on Monday but the president has complained about unbalanced trade with the EU, saying on Sunday: \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products, they take almost nothing and we take everything from them. Millions of cars, tremendous amounts of food and farm products.\"",
      "So one way the UK might be seen to be out of line in the mind of Trump - and at risk of tariffs - is if Britain was also running a trade surplus with America.",
      "Does the UK have a trade surplus with the US?",
      "The UK's Office for National Statistics estimates the UK had a surplus of around \u00a371bn in trade with the US in 2023, the most recent full year for which we have data.",
      "But the American statistics office, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, estimates the US had a surplus on its trade with the UK in that year of $14.5bn, around \u00a312bn.",
      "How can both be true?",
      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",
      "Higher borrowing costs could slow the UK economy and also put pressure on the UK government to cut public spending or raise taxes in order to keep within its chosen borrowing rules.",

    "summary": "Economists warn that the introduction of tariffs could lead to prices rising on a wide range of products.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has hit the pause button - for now, at least - on imposing tariffs against imports from US neighbours Canada and Mexico.",
      "Last-minute agreements with the leaders of Mexico and Canada have suspended for a month a tit-for-tat trade war in North America.",
      "The three trade partners have deeply integrated economies and supply chains, with an estimated $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders daily.",
      "Trump says he wants to protect American industry, but many economists warn such tariffs could lead to prices rising for consumers in the US.",
      "That's because the tax is paid by the domestic company importing the goods, who may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly, or to reduce imports, which would mean fewer products available.",
      "So what could get more expensive if Trump's tariffs do eventually go ahead?",
      "Cars",
      "Cars would probably go up in price - by about $3,000 according to TD Economics.",
      "That's because parts cross the US, Canadian and Mexican borders multiple times before a vehicle is assembled.",
      "As a result of higher taxes paid on the importing of parts to build the cars, it is likely the costs will be passed on to customers.",
      "\"Suffice it to say that disrupting these trends through tariffs... would come with significant costs,\" said Andrew Foran, an economist at TD Economics.",
      "He added \"uninterrupted free trade\" in the car-making sector had \"existed for decades\", which had led to lower prices for consumers.",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and MexicoWhat are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Trump agrees to pause tariffs on Canada and Mexico",
      "What are tariffs and will prices go up?",
      "Beer, Tennessee whiskey and tequila",
      "Popular Mexican beers Modelo and Corona could get more expensive for US customers if the American companies importing them pass on the increased import taxes.",
      "However, it's also possible that rather than passing on the cost increase, firms could just import less.",
      "Modelo became the number one beer brand in the US in 2023, and remains in the top spot, for now.",
      "It's more complex when it comes to spirits. The sector has been largely free of tariffs since the 1990s. Industry bodies from the US, Canada and Mexico issued a joint statement in advance of the tariffs being announced saying they were \"deeply concerned\".",
      "They say that certain brands, such as Bourbon, Tennessee whiskey, tequila and Canadian whisky are \"recognized as distinctive products and can only be produced in their designated countries\".",
      "So given the production of these drinks cannot simply be moved, supplies might be impacted, leading to price rises. The trade bodies also highlighted that many companies own different spirit brands in all three countries.",
      "Houses",
      "Imports of Canadian lumber would be hit by import tariffs to the US. Trump has said the US has \"more lumber than we ever use\".",
      "However, the National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs \"because of their harmful effect on housing affordability\".",
      "The industry body has \"serious concerns\" that the tariffs on lumber could increase the cost of building homes - which are mostly made out of wood in the US - and also put off developers building new homes.",
      "\"Consumers end up paying for the tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" the NAHB said.",
      "Maple syrup",
      "When it comes to the trade war with Canada, the \"most obvious\" household impact would be on the price of Canadian maple syrup, according to Thomas Sampson, associate professor of economics at the London School of Economics.",
      "Canada's billion-dollar maple syrup industry accounts for 75% of the world's entire maple syrup production.",
      "The majority of the sweet staple - around 90% - is produced in the province of Quebec, where the world's sole strategic reserve of maple syrup was set up 24 years ago.",
      "\"That maple syrup is going to become more expensive. And that's a direct price increase that households will face,\" Mr Sampson said.",
      "\"If I buy goods that are domestically produced in the US, but that are produced using inputs from Canada, the price of those goods is also going to go up,\" he added.",
      "Fuel prices",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. According to the most recent official trade figures, 61% of oil imported into the US between January and November last year came from Canada.",
      "While 25% has been slapped on Canadian goods imported to the US, its energy faces a lower 10% tariff.",
      "Now the US doesn't have a shortage of oil, but the type its refineries are designed to process means it depends on so-called \"heavier\" - i.e. thicker - crude oil from mostly Canada and some from Mexico.",
      "\"Many refineries need heavier crude oil to maximize flexibility of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel production,\" according to the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.",
      "That means if Canada decided in retaliation to any US tariffs to reduce crude oil exports, that could lead to prices rising at the petrol pumps.",
      "Avocados",
      "One food import that American consumers could see a significant price increase in is avocados. Grown primarily in Mexico due to its warm, humid climate, Mexican avocados make up nearly 90% of the US avocado market each year.",
      "However, if tariffs come into force, the US Agriculture Department has warned that the cost of avocados - along with popular avocado-based dishes like guacamole - could surge, especially by Super Bowl Sunday on 9 February.",
      "What about goods in Canada?",
      "Before Trump's agreement with Justin Trudeau to pause tariffs was announced on Monday, Canada had threatened retaliatory import taxes.",
      "An initial C$30bn tranche had been due to begin on Tuesday - meaning prices would have probably increased for consumers north of the border as well.",
      "Ottawa had released a list of all the US imports that would have immediately been targeted with matching 25% tariffs. They included grocery store staples, like oranges - a produce that Canada cannot grow in abundance due to its cooler climate.",
      "Alcohol originating from the US would also be harder for Canadians to find. Provinces like Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia said they would pull all American booze off their shelves starting on Tuesday.",
      "Any US alcohol - including beer and wine - that Canadians could find would likely see a price increase, as it's on the menu for retaliatory tariffs.",

      "The company is still considering whether to appeal against a decision by the water industry regulator Ofwat to increase bills by 35% above inflation over the next five years \u2013 short of the 53% increase it applied for.",
      "Thames Water has been struggling for some time and has been heavily criticised over its performance following a series of sewage discharges and leaks.",
      "The dire state of the company's finances emerged about 18 months ago when it began a search for funding to avoid collapse.",

      "But regardless of what happens to the company in the future, water supplies to households will continue as normal.",
      "In the latest bid to survive, lenders have offered Thames a further loan of up to \u00a33bn in two instalments.",
      "The first payment is to get it through to the autumn, and a second is to be used if the company decides to appeal against Ofwat's 35% bill rise to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - a process that could take up to a year.",
      "The company has until 18 February to launch an appeal to the CMA.",
      "Why is Thames Water in so much trouble?",

      "The court hearing on Monday is scheduled for four days with a possible extension as a much smaller group of lenders is challenging the terms of the lifeline and proposing an alternative.",
      "Although Thames will not collapse immediately if the deal is not approved by the judge, insiders have acknowledged that the company will move a step closer to temporary nationalisation \u2013 a so-called Special Administration Regime \u2013 if it fails.",
      "The government has already sounded out a number of consultancies to take that on if the situation arises.",
      "The company has been keen to stress that whatever happens, its services to 16 million customers would continue uninterrupted, but big questions about the future of Thames and other key infrastructure providers have been thrown up.",
      "Some argue that Thames should be allowed to go bust and have the government take over the company due to it being the architect of its own misfortune. Previous owners loaded the company with debt, took out big dividends and paid executives handsomely. Caving in to its demands for customers to pay more now for a failing service would be a gross injustice.",
      "Others say that poor regulation has allowed this mess. Bills were kept too low for too long which hampered investment in the aging infrastructure that is now being overwhelmed by a wetter climate. Ofwat is fighting yesterday's battle and making things worse by imposing fines of tens of millions of pounds for failures, thus further depriving the company of the funds to fix the very things it is being fined for.",
      "What Thames and ministers both agree on is that neither want this sprawling company on the government's books. Consultancy Teneo has predicted a temporary nationalisation would cost up to \u00a32bn a year.",
      "However, a wider, perhaps more important argument made by some is that the failure of Thames as a private company would send an unhelpful message to the international investors that Chancellor Rachel Reeves hopes will invest hundreds of billions in UK airports, wind farms, rail links and everything else on her long shopping list of growth-boosting projects.",
      "Sources close to the company and its creditors argue that we cannot agonise over and regulate for past mistakes. We are where we are - between a rock and a hard place. Carve out a special deal for Thames - or risk its collapse.",
      "Thames has just over two weeks to appeal to the CMA to bump up the bills it's allowed to charge. It's not without risk - the CMA could revise them down.",
      "Last week, the chair of the CMA was forced out by ministers unimpressed by the regulator's focus on growth. Thames says it needs higher bills to invest \u00a320bn over the next five years. It will be an interesting test case for the new chair."

      "China, Canada and Mexico vow swift response to Trump tariffs",
      "How world responds to Trump's tariffs is what matters next",
      "How do tariffs work?",
      "In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.",
      "So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (\u00a338,000) subject to a 25% tariff, would face a $12,500 charge.",
      "The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.",
      "So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.",
      "Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3.1tn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.",
      "And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.",
      "The question of where the final \u201ceconomic\u201d burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.",
      "If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.",
      "If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn\u2019t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.",
      "'Is it for a day or four years?' Tariff uncertainty spooks small businesses",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.",
      "In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.",
      "All three scenarios are theoretically possible.",
      "But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.",
      "A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that \"imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases\". Only 2% disagreed.",
      "Raising prices",
      "Let\u2019s use a concrete example.",
      "Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.",
      "Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.",
      "There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.",
      "The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump\u2019s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.",
      "A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.",
      "The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.",
      "Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.",
      "\u201cUnder my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,\" he said on the campaign trail.",
      "The political context for Trump\u2019s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.",
      "In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.",
      "Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.",
      "And researchers who studied the impact of Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.",
      "Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.",
      "By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.",
      "It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.",
      "And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.",
      "Impact on trade deficit",
      "Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.",
      "\u201cTrade deficits hurt the economy very badly,\u201d he has said.",
      "In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.",
      "Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump\u2019s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.",
      "Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.",
      "For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.",
      "The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.",
      "There are some economists who support Trump\u2019s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.",
      "Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.",
      "And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump\u2019s proposed extension of tariffs, kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.",
      "It also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",

      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",

      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:10:01 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",
    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Friends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".",
      "Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible, said: \"This huge increase in emissions won't help our economy, and would just encourage the small group of frequent flyers who take most of the flights.\"",
      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",
      "Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.",
      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",

      "The case \"is supposed to be resolved here in court\", Lively's attorney, Michael Gottlieb told Jude Lewis Liman. \"It's not supposed to be resolved in the press.\"",

      "In response, Mr Freedman said Mr Gottlieb was trying to impose a \"gag order\" preventing him from talking to the media. Baldoni, he said, was the one who had suffered harm to his reputation.",

      "He said that if the case ended up being \"litigated in the press\", he could be forced to move up a March 2026 trial date so that jurors do not become prejudiced against either of the defendants.",
      "The judge also said he would adopt a New York Bar Association measure - Rule 3.6 - that bars lawyers from making statements publicly that could sway the outcome of a trial.",
      "Monday's hearing came after Baldoni filed an amended complaint against Lively, which included a 168-page \"timeline\" of events in the case. His team also launched a website with the new complaint as well as other publicly available videos and text messages surrounding the case.",
      "Lively's lawyer brought up the website in court on Monday. \"Who created the website?\" Mr Gottlieb asked. \"Who funded it?\"",
      "Mr Gottlieb also took issue with out-takes Baldoni has released from a romantic scene in It Ends With Us, which he says proves that Lively's allegations of sexual harassment are unfounded.",
      "But Lively has responded by saying the footage of the pair filming a slow dance scene is \"damning\" and corroborates her claims.",

Baldoni is suing the New York Times for libel, claiming his co-star gave the outlet advance access to her civil rights complaint. The Times was the first a story to publish about her suit last December. The New York Times has denied these allegations.",

      "He also said Baldoni and Lively's legal teams would need to agree to a protective order, a legal document that shields people involved in the case from another person accused of abusing or harassing them.",
      "Such an order is necessary, Judge Liman said, because of the \"significant number of high-profile individuals\" in the case and the \"nature of the allegations\".",
      "During the hearing, Baldoni's attorney also pressed the judge to stick to the pre-trial schedule that both sides suggested, saying his client wanted the case to progress \"as quickly as possible\".",

    "title": "How LA fires devastation shaped this year's Grammys",
    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 05:24:11 GMT",
    "summary": "In a show  filled with musical royalty, the star of the Grammys this year was the city of LA.",
    "story": [
      "In a show celebrating the biggest names in music, the star of the night was the city of Los Angeles.",
      "The historic fires that tore through Los Angeles became the theme of this year's Grammys. Reminders of the tragedy seeped into the musical performances and donation drives for relief efforts throughout the show.",
      "There were questions over whether the ceremony, the \"Oscars for Music,\" would go on as planned on Sunday after its host city saw its most devastating fire disaster ever recorded - blazes that were only fully doused on Friday after burning for 24 days.",
      "The week of glitzy parties and events that typically mark Grammys week were cancelled. Even the hallmark rowdy after-parties were axed.",
      "In the end, it became a moment of perseverance for the city - the epicentre of entertainment - and a chance to shed light on the intense need for those who have lost homes and loved ones.",
      "Twenty-nine people have died and more than 16,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed - with whole neighbourhoods now ash. Many artists and industry professionals are among those who lost homes, studios and equipment.",
      "Preformances honour LA",
      "The awards opened with a special performance by the Los Angeles band Dawes, two brothers whose homes were destroyed in the recent wildfires.",
      "The duo were joined on stage by former Grammy winners including Sheryl Crow, John Legend, Brad Paisley and Brittany Howard to perform Randy Newman's classic song I Love LA.",
      "After the performance, Dawes - brothers Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith - reflected on this moment for the city and how they'd become LA's unofficial ambassadors in the fire aftermath.",
      "\"For a lot of musicians, you sort of feel helpless to not know how to help,\" they said. \"We really wanted to get involved, and so this really was a very proud moment for us.\"",
      "They noted they'd never been to the Grammys and now they helped open the show.",
      "\"It's wild to think about our childhood dreams meeting up with an opportunity to help our communities and at such a tragic moment.\"",
      "Throughout the evening, multiple performances provided a nod to the area.",
      "Grammys ceremony opens with tribute to Los AngelesGrammy Awards 2025: Beyonc\u00e9 wins best country album",
      "Grammys ceremony opens with tribute to Los Angeles",
      "Grammy Awards 2025: Beyonc\u00e9 wins best country album",
      "Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga sang a powerful rendition of the Mamas & the Papas classic California Dreamin'. During a segment honouring the late Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder sang We Are the World with a choir of students from two schools lost in the fires.",
      "The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band synonymous with LA, also took the stage to mark the evening. The Grammys audience sang along with Chad Smith and Anthony Kiedis in an impromptu performance of their hit \"Under the Bridge\" - about Los Angeles.",
      "LA firefighters also took the stage during the show. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone spoke before the group and told the audience: \"I am confident that we will recover and rebuild together, because we are LA strong.\"",
      "Then firefighters presented the biggest award of the night - album of the year - with Beyonc\u00e9 winning the elusive honour after four losses in the category over the years.",
      "Fundraising efforts",
      "Nearly every commercial break during the show included a nod to the fires that happened here. Footage of burned down neighbourhoods or an inside look at a skate shop or small business that was destroyed in the blazes.",
      "Host Trevor Noah made mention of the fundraising effort throughout the show - acknowledging big donations that were made. He noted at one point during the broadcast that at least $7 million (\u00a35.7m) had been donated thus far.",
      "Much of the red carpet was plastered with fundraising signs and backdrops with QR codes to a Grammys website where people can donate.",
      "As celebrities strolled along the red carpet, groups of firefighters and first responders also took their walk before the media.",
      "They were greeted by loud applause and thank yous from everyone they passed. Many smiled and took selfies in their uniforms, some even nabbing pictures with celebrities.",
      "One firefighter's jaw dropped when he saw the Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi and they took a picture together.",
      "Los Angeles County Fire Captain Joshua Swaney walked alongside fellow firefighters on the red carpet. He told the BBC that while it was a phenomenal experience being honoured at the event, it was a helpful reminder for the rest of the world that LA is still reeling.",
      "\"This is definitely not what we're used to. That's for sure. It's been a humbling experience to be a part of this,\" he said. \"We are here making sure that people know that there's so much more to Los Angeles than just what's currently happening right now.\"",
      "To cancel the show or not?",
      "The Recording Academy, which runs the show, had said the show was needed more than ever.",
      "Showrunners sought to strike the right tone honouring the victims of the fire and displaying a defiant Los Angeles that will persevere. But there was concern the optics of rich celebrities dolled up with smiles on a red carpet could come off as tone deaf.",
      "Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. highlighted the economic impact, noting that thousands rely on Grammy-related work, particularly in the service industry. He framed the event as a symbol of resilience, arguing that cancelling would not benefit the city or music industry.",
      "\"Cancelling, pushing, moving does not accomplish what us standing together\" does, Mr Mason argued in a webcast before the show. The show will be \"unifying and coming together, honouring music, but also using the power of music to heal, rebuild and provide services to people who need it\".",
      "\"I think this might be one of the most important Grammy weeks we've ever had.\"",
      "Mr Mason told the New York Times that they consulted a range of public officials about whether they should hold the event - including the city's mayor and California Governor Gavin Newsom - and whether it would hinder fire response efforts.",
      "\"They strongly suggested that we continue forward with hosting the event,\" he told the outlet. \"Everyone said there's nothing good that comes from postponing.\"",
      "But there were still worries that the night will be a bad look for the music industry.",
      "\"I actually don't think that the Grammys should be happening,\" Elyn Kazarian, a creative director in the music industry, told the BBC.",
      "\"It's just very weird to me that there are going to be celebrities on a red carpet wearing expensive clothes while people in other parts of the city are suffering and whose livelihoods have been destroyed.\"",

      "Artists had to adjust to a new way of promoting their music, relying on digital platforms rather than in-person Grammy week events, which were either cancelled or moved online.",
      "\"I wouldn't necessarily compare the COVID pandemic to what's happening here,\" senior music writer for Variety, Steven J Horowitz, told the BBC. \"COVID lasted for so long and the effects were devastating for years. People had to cancel major releases, and everything shifted to a digital space.\"",

      "\"I know multiple musicians who lost their gear\", Chavez said. \"I know stylists who work in music who lost their houses, who had costumes and whatnot. I know musicians who are born and raised in LA who lost their house.\"",
      "There is also a ripple effect in the industry on those not personally impacted by the fires.",
      "The week of events typically held before the show, which were cancelled this year to help with fundraising efforts instead, helps new musicians and allows them to break out in a crowded market - getting time with top executives and those at major record labels.",
      "\"Visibility is very important for artists,\" Mr Horowitz told the BBC.",
      "\"Say you're a Best New Artist nominee who is relatively unknown to the public - being on these platforms and at these parties is a really big look if you're trying to get your music out in front of the industry. It really does help.\"",

      "Following the fires, Spotify chose to cancel this year's event.",
      "\"We've decided that the most impactful approach is cancelling all our Grammy Week events, including our annual Best New Artist party, and redirecting funds to support efforts to reach local fans and charitable organizations,\" Spotify's Global Head of Music Partnerships and Audience Joe Hadley wrote in an announcement.",
      "The music industry and the Grammys are deeply rooted in Los Angeles, and though the city is going through a devastating period, it has reinforced a sense of community, especially in the music industry.",
      "\"Even if people lost everything, they still have hope. And I think that feeds into what we're going to see in the music industry in the future,\" Mr Horowitz said. \"People aren't going to flee Los Angeles because of this one thing. It's not going to stop L.A. from being one of the main hubs for music in the world.\"",

      "Well, now we're in a pickle.",
      "On her eighth solo record, Cowboy Carter, Beyonc\u00e9 sang about the Grammys' constant, stubborn refusal to award her album of the year.",
      "\"AOTY, I ain't win,\" she sang. \"Take that s--- on the chin.\"",
      "But now she has won, for the album that contains that very lyric. Will she have to go back and re-record it? At the very least, we expect a rewrite on the tour she just announced.",
      "Joking aside, this victory was long, long overdue.",
      "In 2017, Adele even flirted with the idea of handing back her album of the year trophy, saying the music on her album, 25, couldn't compare to Beyonc\u00e9's \"monumental\u2026 beautiful and soul-baring\" Lemonade.",
      "Eyebrows were raised again in 2023, when Harry Styles' fun, but conceptually flimsy, Harry's House bested Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance \u2013 a meticulous exploration of how oppressed black and queer musicians found salvation through house music.",
      "In the end, it took Beyonc\u00e9 to approach a genre that conservative Grammy voters could understand \u2013 country \u2013 in order to secure a victory.",
      "But that's not to downplay the scale of her achievement. Cowboy Carter is a masterpiece that weaves hundreds of musical threads into a thesis about America's cultural past, and the futility of gatekeeping musical genres along racial lines.",
      "The arguments it makes are both timely and urgent, without suffocating the songs.",
      "As the second part of a planned trilogy, this surely won't be Beyonc\u00e9's last trip to the podium.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Sabrina Carpenter's stage malfunction",
      "Sabrina Carpenter has literally been practising for this moment all her life. She made her TV debut in 2011, aged 12 years old, and has been hovering on the fringes of pop superstardom pretty much ever since.",
      "So, after a huge breakthrough in 2024, she was primed and ready for the Grammy stage.",
      "Or was she?",
      "She emerged in a razzle-dazzle showgirl outfit and instantly missed her spotlight. Then she dropped the cane she was supposed to dance with. And, as she descended a grand pearlescent staircase, she suddenly disappeared through a trap door.",
      "Luckily, it was all a humorous ruse! Carpenter skipped back to the stage for a big band version of Espresso, complete with ankle-endangering tap routine.",
      "After changing into a blue, crystal-studded Victoria's Secret bodysuit, she segued effortlessly into Please, Please, Please\u2026 And then the set collapsed on her.",
      "As she leapt into the safety of a dancer's arms, she couldn't contain her laughter.",
      "It was a perfect piece of vaudeville, and the audience lapped it up. Host Trevor Noah, however, wasn't so impressed.",
      "\"That was amazing and funny, which I didn't appreciate,\" the comedian said. \"Really, Sabrina? You're just gonna take my job like that?\"",

      "Among those people were Abel Tesfaye \u2013 aka The Weeknd himself.",
      "He declared the awards were \"corrupt\" and criticised their lack of \"transparency\". Since then, he's refused to submit any of his music for consideration.",
      "So it was something of a coup when he gave an unannounced, unexpected performance in the middle of Sunday's ceremony.",
      "He was introduced by the Recording Academy's CEO, Harvey Mason Jr, who acknowledged the star's criticisms, and described his efforts to revamp the Grammys' electorate, by boosting the number of women and people of colour.",
      "After that, the star took to the stage with two songs from his brand new album, Cry For Me and Timeless.",
      "It was meant to be a celebration of people's ability to learn and grow, but the music was so oppressively drab \u2013 with the Weeknd constantly shrouded in smoke and shadow -  that you wondered whether he'd simply returned to sabotage the Grammys from within.",

      "The pair then made a swift exit, electing to skip the ceremony, driving off into the LA night.",
      "Early reports suggested they had been kicked out, but the BBC understands they left of their own accord, with one source saying that West, \"walked the carpet, got in his car and left\".",
      "They may well have been home by the time West's track Carnival lost out to Kendrick Lamar in the best rap song category.",

      "HIGHLIGHT: Brat Green picks up a prize",
      "Among the three awards Charli XCX picked up was one of the night's most obscure: Best artwork.",
      "At first glance, that might seem odd. The album cover is a plain green square, with the word \"brat\" printed in a deliberately low-resolution Arial font.",
      "But the cover took five months to put together, with designer Brent David Freaney testing around 500 shades of green to produce a garish, nausea-inducing effect.",
      "Charli wanted the artwork to be deliberately off-putting \u2013 reflecting the album's dual themes of partying and self doubt. And she said it was important to challenge the convention of women dressing provocatively to promote their music.",
      "\"Why should anyone have that level of ownership over female artists?\" she asked Vogue magazine.",
      "She added: \"I wanted to go with an offensive, off-trend shade of green to trigger the idea of something being wrong. I'd like for us to question our expectations of pop culture - why are some things considered good and acceptable, and some things deemed bad?",
      "\"I'm interested in the narratives behind that and I want to provoke people. I'm not doing things to be nice.\"",
      "Towards the end of the ceremony, the star's live performance of Von Dutch and Guess saw her transform the biggest and glitziest night in music into a packed and sweaty nightclub.",
      "Emerging from a black SUV, she strutted towards the camera, throwing a glass of champagne against the wall of a parking garage, before launching into what appeared to be an underground rave.",
      "As the performance progressed, she appeared on stage with model Julia Fox and hundreds of dancers, who were then showered in underwear (a reference to the song's lyrics).",

      "LOWLIGHT (if you\u2019re Drake): Kendrick Lamar\u2019s clean sweep",
      "The Grammys have a wobbly history with hip-hop. They didn't introduce a rap category until 1989, a full decade after the Sugarhill Gang introduced the genre to a wide audience with Rapper's Delight. And no rap act has won album of the year since OutKast in 2001.",
      "So it was a rare victory when Compton-born rapper Kendrick Lamar won all five of the awards in which he was nominated for Not Like Us, a furious takedown of his musical rival, Drake.",
      "Among those awards were the prestigious record and song of the year - categories that have only ever recognised a rap song once before (Childish Gambino's This Is America in 2019).",
      "Lamar didn't perform at the ceremony - he plays the Super Bowl halftime show next week instead - but, dressed head to toe in denim, he delivered a powerful message to Grammy voters.",
      "\"At the end of the day, nothing is more powerful than rap music. I don't care what it is. We are the culture\u2026 respect the art form\".",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Janelle Mona\u00e9's moonwalk moment",
      "Music lost one of its biggest legends in 2024, when Quincy Jones died at the age of 91.",
      "As the producer for everyone from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, the Grammys gave him a star-studded send-off that lasted almost 20 minutes.",
      "Cynthia Erivo and Herbie Hancock played a beautiful version of Fly Me To The Moon; while Stevie Wonder's sang We Are The World with choirs from two schools affected by the devastating LA fires.",
      "But it was Janelle Mona\u00e9's performance of Michael Jackson's Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough that blew the roof off.",
      "Dressed in MJ's Billie Jean outfit, she pirouetted and moonwalked and jumped on the tables as if she'd been possessed by the man himself.",
      "Towards the end of the performance, she threw off her jacket to reveal a t-shirt bearing the legend \"I Love QJ\".",
      "And guess who caught it and wore it for the rest of the night?",
      "Taylor Swift.",
      "LOWLIGHT: Snubs for Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift",
      "Even with 94 awards to consider, some people will get overlooked - but nobody expected two of the Grammys' biggest darlings to go home empty-handed.",
      "Taylor Swift was blanked despite scoring six nominations. Voters clearly decided that The Tortured Poets Department wasn't worthy of comparison with her four previous album of the year winners (Fearless, 1989, Folklore and Midnights).",
      "Billie Eilish's wipeout was even more unexpected. She had been the bookmakers' favourite for album of the year, for her third release Hit Me Hard And Soft - but she lost all seven of the categories she was nominated for.",
      "Still, there was a lot of competition this year, especially in the pop categories. And Swift has spoken in the past about how losing album of the year for Red inspired her pop opus, and biggest-seller to date, 1989.",
      "Don't count either of these artists out just yet.",
      "HIGHLIGHT: Trevor Noah's easy-going hosting",
      "There's a reason they keep inviting Trevor Noah back to host the Grammys: He's got the tone right.",
      "He's relaxed, he's engaged with the music, and his humour never punches down.",
      "Here are some of his best quips from the night:",
      "\"Yesterday, Beyonce announced her new tour. Everyone saw that. I will say, though, Beyonce, there's tariffs. We can't afford a new tour, right?

And you don't wanna mess with them.\"\"The Beatles are nominated tonight for Record of the Year. Yes, the legendary band from Liverpool used AI to put out a new song after 53 years.

    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "A major review into the NHS care and treatment of a paranoid schizophrenic who killed three people in Nottingham has identified numerous failings that show \"the system got it wrong\".",
      "Valdo Calocane stabbed to death students Barnaby Webber and Grace O'Malley-Kumar, both 19, and 65-year-old school caretaker Ian Coates on 13 June 2023.",
      "The case, which resulted in Calocane being sentenced to a hospital order in January 2024, sparked a number of reviews including the mental health homicide review, commissioned by NHS England.",
      "The victims' families said the report's findings - published on Wednesday - required a judge-led public inquiry, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has previously committed to, \"to be held as soon as possible\".",
      "In response, the government repeated its commitment to an inquiry into the attacks, with work ongoing to establish its scope.",
      "The NHS said it had taken the decision to publish the report in full, in line with the wishes of the families, and \"given the level of detail already in the public domain\".",
      "The independent review, by Theemis Consulting, looked into the treatment given to Calocane by Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust prior to the killings, as well as the interactions the NHS had with other agencies involved in his care.",
      "The key findings of the report include:",
      "Calocane's risk \"was not fully understood, managed, documented or communicated\"There were missed opportunities to take more assertive action towards Calocane's careThe voice of Calocane's family \"was not effectively considered to support the dynamic evaluation of risk\" during his treatmentOther patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",

      "Other patients under the care of the same trust, some of whom had been discharged, had also perpetrated acts of \"serious violence\" across 15 incidents between 2019 and 2023",
      "Calocane had no contact with mental health services or his GP for about nine months prior to the killings",
      "The review is one of many to have taken place following the killings.",
      "This includes the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which is looking into both Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire Police.",
      "A review into the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) found while prosecutors had been right to accept Calocane's pleas of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility, they could have handled the case better.",
      "And in May, a judge ruled Calocane's sentence was not unduly lenient.",
      "In a statement, the victims' families said a statutory public inquiry should happen \"as soon as possible\", examining this case as well as \"wider failings in the care, treatment and sectioning of those with mental illnesses\".",
      "\"It is the first duty of the government to keep its citizens safe - it is now clear that the previous government failed Grace, Barnaby and Ian in that duty,\" the statement added.",
      "\"There are grave questions to be answered about how multiple organisations failed to respond to the risk he posed; allowing him to roam the streets and kill three innocent people.\"",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the government had worked with NHS England to ensure the report was published in full.",
      "\"Sunlight is the best disinfectant,\" he said. \"The findings will help to support an inquiry into this attack and we'll set out the next steps as this develops.\"",
      "He added he had called for all the recommendations made in a previous Care Quality Commission (CQC) report into the case to be implemented across the country.",
      "The new report also sets out the contact Calocane had with mental health services before he killed Mr Webber, Ms O'Malley-Kumar and Mr Coates, and then stole Mr Coates's van before driving it into three pedestrians - Wayne Birkett, Marcin Gawronski and Sharon Miller - all of whom were seriously injured.",
      "The report states the former University of Nottingham student first came into contact with mental health services on 24 May 2020, when he was 28, when he was arrested for criminal damage to a neighbour's flat.",
      "It was documented that Calocane's behaviour was an episode of psychosis brought on by the stress of course work and a forthcoming exam, coupled with a lack of sleep.",
      "Shortly after returning to his home, Calocane again tried to gain access to a neighbour's flat. His neighbour was so frightened that she jumped from a first-floor window, sustaining back injuries which required surgery.",
      "Calocane was then detained for the first time under section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which meant he could be kept in hospital against his will for up to 28 days - known as a \"section\".",
      "Subsequent contacts with services saw him labelled as having paranoid schizophrenia.",
      "After about a month in hospital, Calocane was sent home with reviews expected from the community crisis team and the early intervention in psychosis (EIP) service.",
      "He was initially called by the crisis team. The contact was a phone call rather than a face-to-face appointment \"because of Covid-19 restrictions at the time\".",
      "His family expressed concerns because they felt he could \"play down his symptoms\" over the phone.",
      "In July 2020, Calocane was admitted to hospital for a second time after forcibly entering a neighbour's flat.",
      "He was sectioned again, this time under section 3 of the Mental Health Act, which allows for a longer hospital stay of up to six months.",
      "According to medical records shared by Calocane's family with BBC Panorama, while Calocane was ill in hospital, a psychiatrist observed that \"there seems to be no insight or remorse and the danger is that this will happen again and perhaps Valdo will end up killing someone\".",
      "Two weeks after this entry was made, Calocane was discharged from Highbury Hospital.",
      "According to the report, his family \"felt this was a real missed opportunity to fully understand [Calocane's] diagnosis, risk and to get to grips with a treatment plan that [Calocane] was concordant with\".",
      "Three months before his third hospital admission in August 2021, Calocane's family again reported concerns over his mental health.",
      "'Not liking needles'",
      "At the end of August, his care co-ordinator visited him at home with a colleague, noting that he was no longer taking his medication and had no intention of continuing treatment.",
      "A month later, the report said he had \"significantly assaulted\" police officers who attended in support for a Mental Health Act assessment.",
      "On a number of occasions, his care co-ordinator had suggested the use of depot medication - which releases slowly over time meaning patients need to administer medications less frequently.",
      "But, the report said, the inpatient teams were trying to treat him \"in the least restrictive way\", and took on board his reasons for not wanting to take injectable depot medication, \"which included him not liking needles\".",
      "After multiple missed appointments, in January 2022, officials contemplated discharging Calocane from the EIP service due to a lack of engagement.",
      "But the following day, the EIP learned Calocane had trapped two housemates in their flat, which resulted in the police being called.",
      "He was assessed under the Mental Health Act, but not detained.",
      "Calocane was admitted to hospital at the end of January 2022 for almost a month - his fourth hospital admission.",
      "After being discharged, it was noted that none of Calocane's care providers should visit him at home alone because of his \"history of violence and aggression\".",
      "Calocane then missed a few appointments to collect his medication over the coming months, and a new care co-ordinator tried to contact him multiple times.",
      "After these failed attempts, a decision was taken in September 2022 to discharge Calocane from the EIP service to his GP.",
      "The report said \"opportunities to assertively try to reach out to [Calocane] when he disengaged from services were limited\" because of pressures in the team.",
      "\"Due to multiple factors, including workload, the discharge system did not function as intended,\" the report said.",
      "It added there was no contact between Calocane and mental health services, or his GP, for roughly nine months from this time until the killings.",
      "'Watershed moment'",
      "Dr Jessica Sokolov, regional medical director at NHS England (Midlands), said: \"It's clear the system got it wrong, including the NHS, and the consequences of when this happens can be devastating.",
      "\"This is not acceptable, and I unreservedly apologise to the families of victims on behalf of the NHS and the organisations involved in delivering care to Valdo Calocane before this incident took place.\"",
      "Claire Murdoch, NHS England's national mental health director, added: \"Nationally, we have asked every mental health trust to review these findings and set out action plans for how they treat and engage with people who have a serious mental illness, including how they work with other agencies such as the police.",
      "\"And we've instructed trusts not to discharge people if they do not attend appointments.\"",
      "Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, said the publication of the review \"should act as a watershed moment revealing the truth and honouring the needs of the families of victims of homicides by people with mental illness or disorder\".",
      "\"We have been involved in and supported the families of both victims and perpetrators in over 100 such inquiries in the last 30 years,\" Ms Wallace said.",
      "\"Today's findings expose the same flaws and fault lines that have resulted in tragedies, yet little seems to have changed: basic failings of communication, inadequacies in assessing risk, and in over half the cases we analysed, not heeding the warnings of families or those close to the patient. As in this case, it is too often cited that it was the individual's choice to 'disengage with services' as a reason for the lack of effective follow-up and care.\"",
      "In a statement, Calocane's family said: \"We wish to express once again how deeply sorry we are for this horrific tragedy, and the immeasurable pain Valdo's actions have caused to so many involved. To all of the victims, their families and friends, we truly are sorry.",
      "\"The report confirms what we and many others have known for a while: the mental healthcare system is in crisis and in need of immediate intervention, which we believe must come from the government. It is not enough to say that the NHS failed; we must be honest in recognising that the NHS has been set up for failure, and cannot be left to fix itself on its own.",
      "\"There are good people in mental healthcare, including in this case as well, and front-line staff need our help more than our condemnation. We maintain that the only way to prevent future tragedies like this is to properly resource mental healthcare throughout the UK, so that workers have the right tools to do their jobs properly.\"",
      "The chief executive of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Ifti Majid, added: \"We apologise unreservedly for the opportunities we missed in the care of Valdo Calocane and accept the Theemis report in its entirety including its findings and recommendations.",
      "\"We are making clear progress with a trust-wide plan, which is already delivering key improvements in areas such as risk assessment and discharge processes.\"",

    "story": [
      "A self-styled \"beauty consultant\", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered.",
      "Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger.",
      "BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death).",
      "One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather \"have died\" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment.",
      "Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas.",
      "Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient.",
      "He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose.",
      "Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing \u00a31,200. We paid a \u00a3200 deposit.",
      "Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an \"ultrasound specialist doctor\", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection.",
      "Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. \"You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,\" he suggested.",
      "By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of \u00a32,000.",
      "We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter.",
      "Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were \"shocking\", \"very dangerous\", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications.",
      "\"Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,\" said Mr Humzah. \"The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death.\"",
      "The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures.",
      "Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment.",
      "One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment.",
      "Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her.",
      "All she wanted, she says, was a \"peachy bum\".",
      "But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts.",
      "She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate.",
      "In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a \"dingy little hallway\" for about half an hour.",
      "\"I should have turned and ran,\" she says, \"but I had paid \u00a3600 deposit and travelled all this way.\"",
      "She was taken into a small room where there \"was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop\", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer.",
      "After counting out the rest of her cash - \u00a32,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool.",
      "As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable.",
      "\"I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,\" she says. \"I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood.\"",
      "By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: \"I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured.\"",
      "She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk.",
      "\"I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics.\"",
      "By this point, sepsis had begun to set in.",
      "\"My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,\" says Joanne. \"I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming.\"",
      "In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly.",
      "After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account.",
      "Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation.",
      "Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery.",
      "Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital.",
      "She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: \"Mum, I think I'm going to die.\"",
      "Louise had contracted sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock.",
      "Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton.",
      "\"How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?\" she told the BBC.",
      "However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable.",
      "Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened.",
      "A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form.",
      "BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate.",
      "From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising.",
      "Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped.",
      "In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer.",
      "Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC).",
      "Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer.",
      "All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement.",
      "\"We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,\" she says. \"Some have, and nothing has been done.\"",
      "So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council -  confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury.",
      "But \"he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on\", says Ms Collins.",
      "We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was \"urgently looking at options for tougher regulation\".",
      "It said our findings were \"shocking\" and that those caught \"dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law\".",
      "We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic.",
      "As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it.",
      "We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care.",
      "\"No,\" he said - and told us to leave.",
      "The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins.",
      "\"The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault.\"",

      "Letby, who is serving 15 whole life sentences for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between 2015 and 2016, has already lost two bids to appeal against her convictions.",
      "The panel's findings are likely to form part of an application which has been made by her lawyers to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for her case to be investigated as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The lengthy and medically technical press conference was organised by Letby's legal team who had said the panel would present \"significant new medical evidence\".",
      "Dr Lee, a Canadian neonatal care expert, said there were alternative explanations for each of Letby's convictions for murder or attempted murder.",
      "He said he became involved in the case after learning that an academic paper he co-authored on air embolism, one of the methods Letby was said to have used to attack babies, had formed part of the prosecution case in her trial.",
      "Dr Lee said the 14 experts, including medical professionals from Canada, the US, Japan, Germany, Sweden and the UK, had looked at 17 cases at the heart of Letby's prosecution and had compiled an \"impartial evidence-based report\".",
      "The report presented at the conference was a summary of the panel's findings, and the full report would be submitted to Letby's legal team, Dr Lee said.",
      "Dr Lee provided what he said were highly detailed grounds baby-by-baby for concluding that none of the murders occurred.",
      "He added: \"We did not find any murders. In all cases, death or injury were due to natural causes or just bad medical care.\"",
      "\"Lucy was charged with seven murders and seven attempted murders\", he said.",

      "\"Our full report will go to Lucy's barrister later this month, and then it'll be up to him and the courts to decide what next to do.\"",
      "During Letby's trial, the prosecution referred to the 1989 paper by Dr Lee that looked at cases of air embolus, referring to injuries caused when air is injected into a baby's arteries or veins after staff at the Countess of Chester reported skin discoloration on some of the babies.",
      "In the cases Dr Lee analysed in his paper, those injuries had happened accidentally.",
      "The prosecution argued that one of the methods Letby used to injure or kill babies was to inject air into their veins and used Dr Lee's paper to back that claim.",
      "In the paper, Dr Lee described a distinct discoloration on the babies' skin in 10% of cases.",
      "'Scrutinised'",
      "However, at the press conference Dr Lee said in all of the cases in his paper air was injected into the babies' arteries, not their veins.",
      "He said that the skin discolouration described in the paper was not possible when air was injected into the veins.",
      "Dr Lee said he had recently updated his academic paper and found no cases of skin discolouration linked to air embolism by the venous system.",
      "He prefaced his remarks by saying that the thoughts of each panel member were with the families of the babies who had died.",
      "Former neonatal nurse Letby, now 35, lost two bids to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal last year.",
      "The prosecution's medical case was scrutinised by the Court of Appeal in May last year and found to be safe - and the judges noted Letby herself did not present any experts at her trial offering an alternative view.",
      "Dr Lee had offered to give evidence to the Court of Appeal as part of Letby's application for permission to appeal, but three senior judges said his conclusions did not undermine her convictions.",
      "The judges concluded there had been no prosecution expert evidence diagnosing air embolus solely on the basis of skin discolouration.",
      "Earlier, the CCRC said Letby's lawyers had applied to the commission to investigate her case as a potential miscarriage of justice.",
      "The body said it would now assess the application and determine whether there was new evidence which presented a reasonable chance of a conviction being overturned.",
      "A CCRC spokesperson said: \"We are aware that there has been a great deal of speculation and commentary surrounding Lucy Letby's case, much of it from parties with only a partial view of the evidence.",
      "\"We ask that everyone remembers the families affected by events at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016.\"",
      "Mark McDonald, Letby's barrister, said that because her previous legal team had not called a medical expert at her trial, the information presented was \"new, fresh evidence\".",
      "He said the nurse was convicted because of the medical evidence, and if that was wrong any circumstantial evidence would \"fall away\".",
      "\"The most important thing, the reason why Lucy Letby was convicted, was because of the medical evidence that was presented to the jury that today has been demolished,\" he said.",

      "About 15,000 people in England live with the condition, which mainly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage.",
      "It is caused by genetic change that means people make haemoglobin - a key protein in red blood cells - that doesn't work properly.",
      "This results in red blood cells becoming sickle in shape and stiff and sticky - rather than flexible smooth discs.",
      "These sickle cells do not live as long as healthy red blood cells and can clump as they travel around blood vessels - reducing oxygen to vital parts of the body.",
      "This puts people at risk of organ damage, stroke, heart failure and a greatly  reduced quality of life.",
      "In trials all patients who received the therapy - which tweaks a specific gene and allows the body to make more healthy red blood cells - avoided stays in hospital for a year after treatment and most for three-and-a-half years. Further data is still being studied.",
      "NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the therapy \"could be absolutely transformative \u2013 it could enable patients to live free from the fear of sickle cell crises hanging over them\".",
      "Asiawu Imam, 26, lives in London, where she works as a nurse looking after people who have sickle cell disorder. She also lives with the condition.",
      "When she was younger she was in and out of hospital three to four times a year with painful sickle cell crises.",
      "\"It feels like a stabbing pain, like someone is stabbing you form the inside outwards. It can last anything from half an hour to four days. It is excruciating,\" she said.",
      "The therapy being made available on the NHS gives her hope, and a sense to the community that people with the condition are being taken seriously.",
      "\"This is going to be a life-changing moment for many of my patients.\"",
      "How the gene therapy works",
      "It is a multi-step process.",
      "First, blood stem cells from a patient's bone marrow (where all blood cells originate) are removed from the body.",
      "In the laboratory, a gene-editing tool called Crispr is used.",
      "This allows a specific gene to be pinpointed and very precise editing to take place.",
      "However, instead of directly editing a faulty gene, Casgevy instead takes advantage of a process that happens when babies are in the womb, where they make red blood cells with foetal haemoglobin (a key protein that carries oxygen). This switches to the adult form once they are born.",
      "Crucially foetal haemoglobin is not affected by sickle cell disease, so Crispr acts by dampening down the \"switch\" that makes the body produce the adult form.",
      "Patients have to undergo \"conditioning\" chemotherapy to make sure their bodies are ready to accept the edited stem cells.",
      "Modified stem cells are then transfused back into the body, where they multiply and increase the production of stable, well-functioning red cells.",
      "The full treatment must be considered carefully - it can involve lengthy stays in hospital and may have side effects, including headaches and bleeding problems.",
      "UK approves gene-edit drug for sickle cell disease",
      "First gene-editing therapy may cure blood disorder",
      "The only other current option for a cure is a stem cell transplant - but this can only happen if a closely matched donor is available. There is also a risk of the transplant being rejected.",
      "The gene therapy will be available in specialist centres in London, Manchester and Birmingham to people aged 12 and over who get recurrent sickle cell crises and who cannot find a donor for a stem cell transplant.",
      "John James, chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS\", adding \"the significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community could not be understated\".",
      "He said the news would \"give hope to many\" and was \"incredible\".",
      "However, he added: \"We remain acutely aware that not everyone with sickle cell will be eligible for the potentially life-changing benefits of Casgevy.",
      "\"There is still much work ahead to ensure that everyone living with sickle cell has access to the care, treatments, and support they deserve.\"",
      "The therapy has already been approved for another inherited blood disorder, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia.",
      "It is already being given to patients in other countries such as France, Germany and Italy.",
      "Wales is also expected to provide it in the next few months."

      "Some are on flashing video screens in places where they can easily be seen by children. The BBC has also seen adverts in Morrisons for a similar device called Ploom.",
      "Heated tobacco is different from vapes, which contain nicotine but no tobacco, and they are much less popular. But tobacco companies are keen to promote it as a new revenue stream to replace dwindling cigarette sales.",
      "The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI), which represents local authority trading standards teams, says the ads are \"prohibited\" by the 2002 law.",
      "CTSI says the issue has never been tested in court, so it cannot say conclusively that running them is illegal.",
      "\"The only people who can definitively test it are the courts. Now the courts are chocka. Trading Standards is very stretched, and I think that's probably the reason why you're seeing more and more of these ads,\" Kate Pike, lead officer for tobacco and vaping at CTSI, told the BBC.",

      "PMI says it only agreed to suspend advertising, not stop.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"We maintain our view that communications regarding the iQos device at appropriate points of sale is lawful.\"",
      "Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which makes Ploom, said the 2002 law defines a tobacco product as something that is \"smoked, sniffed, sucked or chewed\", and because heated tobacco products do not produce smoke, they aren't covered by that definition.",
      "Morrisons cited the same argument. \"On that basis, we are comfortable that it is legal for heated tobacco products to be advertised in store,\" it said.",
      "Sainsbury's said the ads were \"in line with current tobacco legislation\".",
      "Both supermarkets say they do not sell the devices to children.",

      "Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of Action on Smoking and Health, said supermarkets advertising these products was \"disgraceful behaviour\".",

      "A spokesperson said: \"This government's landmark Tobacco and Vapes Bill will enhance existing legislation, including on advertising, and put us on track for a smoke-free UK.\"",

      "Bianca says she asked the nurse to use a smaller speculum after reading about it online.",

      "NHS England data from March 2024 showed 44.5% of women aged 25-29 had not been screened in the last 3.5 years. For those aged 30-34, this figure was 35.3%.",
      "The proportion of younger women who have been adequately screened has been falling a little in recent years.",

      "Would you rather do the test yourself?",
      "Some people prefer to carry out medical tests in the comfort of their own homes where possible. Do-it-yourself cervical tests are available in some countries, and researchers at King's College London trialled them in London in 2021 with \"fantastic\" results. They involve doing a vaginal swab which is then sent to a lab.",
      "The NHS said last year it was assessing whether to roll the scheme out more widely.",
      "Eleanor says she felt \"reassured\" knowing that a healthcare professional performed her first screening, but would try doing an at-home version of the test after that if the option were available.",
      "Jack, on the other hand, has his doubts. He says he'd prefer an at-home kit for \"the convenience and flexibility\" but that he'd \"have some hesitation about whether I'd done it correctly\".",

      "Ministers had said that, if a council's housing targets ccould not be met, some protected land known as green belt would be re-labelled grey belt and thereby freed up for development.",
      "However, after conducting an inquiry the committee said it suspected the grey belt concept had been \"eclipsed by more significant changes\" made by the government.",
      "A government spokesperson said its changes to the green belt were \"just one of the ambitious housing reforms we have set out to solve the housing crisis and boost economic growth\".",

      "Green belts were established more than 70 years ago with five purposes, including restricting the sprawl of urban areas and protecting the countryside.",
      "In a letter to Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, chair of the Built Environment Committee Lord Moylan said the green belt had been treated as \"sacrosanct\"  making it difficult for local authorities to build on the area, despite a high demand for more homes.",

      "Under the new rules, building on green belt land will be be allowed if other options have been exhausted, the government has said.",
      "\"It is difficult to see what the grey belt regime will add in terms of the ability to build on the green belt in light of this requirement,\" Lord Moylan said.",

      "The two stats agencies have looked at this discrepancy and agree it is due to different ways of measuring trade.",
      "One factor is the UK agencies, unlike their US counterparts, do not count trade flows through British crown dependencies such as the Isle of Man, some of which are significant financial services hubs and markedly affect the overall figures.",
      "Another key, related, element seems to be differences in the measurement of services trade - things such as banking and finance - as opposed to physical goods.",
      "But the bottom line is there is still a degree of uncertainty about what precisely is driving the overall difference in the statistics and both agencies are trying to work it out.",
      "In the meantime, the UK government will doubtless be hoping President Trump prefers to use the US data, which shows America is selling more to the UK than it is buying - and will focus on the goods rather than services trade.",
      "If the president were to impose a blanket tariff on UK exports to the US it would affect around \u00a360bn of goods sent in 2023, according to the UK's figures.",
      "Pharmaceutical products accounted for \u00a38.8bn of the UK's goods exports to the US in that year, cars \u00a36.4bn and power generation machinery \u00a35.2bn.",
      "While the immediate impact of the tariffs would be to make the price of these imported goods for US firms and consumers higher, over time they could reduce American demand for them, which could have a negative impact on the UK firms exporting them.",
      "How else could the UK be affected?",
      "There are other ways in which Britain could be negatively affected by US tariffs on other countries.",
      "Slower growth in the global economy and, in particular, the EU - with which the UK still does around half of its trade - would impede the UK's growth prospects.",
      "If our trading partners were to fall into recession due to tariffs, analysts say they would cut interest rates and their currencies would drop in value making British exports to them more expensive.",
      "\"The US imposing tariffs on our other trading partners will still have a negative effect on the UK economy through its effect on supply chains and the exchange rate,\" said Ahmet Kaya, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).",
      "Niesr has estimated that the 25% tariffs the US has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada could reduce UK GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points in 2025.",
      "Some economists warn exports - such as Chinese-made steel - that might get diverted from the US markets due to the new tariffs, could be sold at below the cost of production, or \"dumped\" in UK markets, which might have a negative impact on the sales of UK steel producers.",
      "Some analysts say higher US interest rates as a result of the tariffs could also spill over to UK borrowing markets.",
      "One of the reasons UK government borrowing costs, or Gilt yields, temporarily spiked upwards in January, was because American government bond yields had also risen.",
      "\"The main threat to the UK economy from Trump's tariffs may well be the spillover from higher US interest rates, rather than tariffs themselves,\" says the economist Julian Jessop.",
      "\"US and UK government bond yields are now moving in lockstep again. If the Fed [US central bank] is more reluctant to cut US rates, as seems likely, borrowing costs will be higher for longer in the UK as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK is \"not choosing between the US and the EU\", Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said after President Donald Trump threatened the European Union with trade tariffs.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico - which have both since been paused - and said he would take similar action against the EU but suggested a deal could be \"worked out\" with the UK.",
      "Asked if he would be willing to water down attempts to forge closer ties with the EU in exchange for keeping the US on side, Sir Keir said both relationships were important to the UK.",
      "\"Now, that for me isn't new, I think that's always been the case and will be the case for many, many years to come,\" he added.",
      "The prime minister told a press conference in Brussels it was \"early days\" when it came to tariff talks with the US and that he backed \"open and strong trading relations\".",
      "Sir Keir was in Belgium to meet Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and attend talks with EU leaders - the first PM to do so since Brexit.",
      "Asked about tensions between the US and the EU, Rutte said there were \"always issues between allies\" but that would \"not get in the way of our collective determination to keep our deterrent strong\".",
      "On Ukraine, he said Nato - the military alliance of Western countries - had to \"not only sustain but continue to step up our support\" to ensure Ukraine could negotiate with Russia from \"a position of strength\".",
      "He added that spending 2% of national income on defence was \"not enough to keep us safe\" and that there was \"no time to waste\" in boosting funding.",
      "Currently Nato asks every member country to spend a least 2% of GDP on defence, however it is thought only 23 of the 32 members meet the target.",
      "Sir Keir said the UK currently spends 2.3% and that his government would shortly be setting out \"the path\" towards reaching 2.5%.",
      "Speaking at a European Council dinner, the prime minister called for more military collaboration between the UK and Europe including by improving military mobility and logistics across Europe, focusing on research and development and deepening industrial collaboration.",
      "He also said there should be more co-operation to protect against state threats and sabotage, including on subsea infrastructure. This comes after the UK issued a warning to Russia last month after a spy ship was spotted near undersea cables.",
      "While defence is the focus of his Brussels trip, for Sir Keir it is also part of an ongoing bid to \"reset\" UK-EU relations.",
      "The UK government wants to forge stronger links with the EU - but that could anger the US and risk the UK getting caught up in a trade war.",
      "Similarly, the EU might object to Sir Keir siding with the US rather than its European neighbours.",
      "Earlier, No 10 said the prime minister trusted Trump and pointed to \"a really constructive early set of conversations\" between the two men.",
      "\"We've got a fair and balanced trading relationship which benefits both sides of the Atlantic,\" the spokesman added.",

      "Trump says US tariffs on EU will happen, but tells BBC a UK deal 'could be worked out'",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "Following Trump's tariffs announcements over the weekend, European and Asian stock markets fell, with car manufacturers particularly badly hit.",

      "Analysis produced last year by the University of Sussex suggested the UK could face a \u00a322bn hit to exports if the US imposed a blanket 20% tariff on all imports.",
      "Trump believes imposing tariffs will help grow the US economy and protect jobs, however it could lead to consumers paying more as prices adjust to the taxes.",
      "On Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said the imposition of the 25% tariffs had been delayed after reaching an agreement with the US which would see her country deploy 10,000 troops to tackle drug trafficking into the US.",
      "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also confirmed that Trump's proposed tariffs of 25% on Canadian goods would be \"paused for at least 30 days while we work together\".",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU wanted a constructive dialogue with the US but was ready to respond firmly if it was \"unfairly\" targeted by the new Trump administration.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said that if EU interests were attacked, the trading bloc would have to \"make itself respected and thus react\".",
      "EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there were \"no winners in trade wars\", but if there was a trade war with the US \"then the one laughing on the side is China\".",
      "Asked earlier if he would put tariffs on the UK, Tump said: \"UK is out of line but I'm sure that one... I think that one can be worked out.\"",
      "He added his discussions with the British prime minister had \"been very nice\" adding: \"We've had a couple of meetings. We've had numerous phone calls. We're getting along very well.\"",

    "summary": "Ofsted scrapped its single-word judgements for schools after the death of head teacher Ruth Perry.",
    "story": [
      "The government will step in more quickly to help struggling schools based on the findings of new Ofsted report cards, the education secretary has said.",
      "Bridget Phillipson said in a speech on Monday that the old single-word Ofsted judgements, which were scrapped last year, were \"too blunt\" and \"too vague\" to serve a purpose.",
      "She said new regional teams, with a budget of up to \u00a3100,000 per school, would help turn around the 600 \"stuck\" schools in England which had received back-to-back negative judgements from Ofsted.",
      "However, the report cards have drawn strong criticism from school leaders, who said the proposals risk \"replicating the worst aspects of the current system\".",
      "Prof Julia Waters, whose sister Ruth Perry took her own life after an Ofsted inspection, said it appeared to be \"a rehash of the discredited and dangerous system it is meant to replace\".",
      "The changes follow a major public debate around Ofsted after a coroner ruled that an inspection contributed to the death of primary school head teacher Mrs Perry in 2023.",
      "Phillipson pushed back on the criticism of the report cards after her speech, saying parents wanted more information about schools.",
      "She also said she was \"delighted to see the debate raging\" over the proposed reforms, saying \"that is how we shape the best education system\".",
      "She said report cards would provide \"rich, granular insight\" which would help to deliver \"tailored\" support for struggling schools.",
      "Those schools which do not improve will be transferred to a successful academy trust, even if they are already run by a different academy or a council.",
      "Under Ofsted's proposals, the old one or two-word judgements, ranging across four grades from \"Outstanding\" to \"Inadequate\", will be replaced from the 2025 autumn term by a report card describing what inspectors have found on key aspects of each school, including:",
      "Quality of educationBehaviour and attendancePersonal developmentLeadership and management",
      "Quality of education",
      "Behaviour and attendance",
      "Personal development",
      "Leadership and management",
      "There will be five possible grades for each area, which are also one or two words in length: \"causing concern\", \"attention needed\", \"secure\", \"strong\" and \"exemplary\".",
      "The grading scales will focus on how schools support disadvantaged and vulnerable pupils, and there will be more emphasis on the local circumstances in which schools operate.",
      "A separate part of the report card will say whether the school's duties around safeguarding have been met.",
      "The new format will be used for inspections across all settings, from early years to further education colleges, but will be tailored to the type of provider, Ofsted said.",
      "Ofsted boss Sir Martyn Oliver said the proposals were designed to \"raise standards and improve the lives of children, particularly the most disadvantaged\".",
      "He said the \"suite of grades\" would give parents \"much more detail\" and help identify a school's strengths and areas for improvement.",
      "However, school leaders' unions said the new system would add \"enormous pressure\" to schools, and could \"worsen an already severe recruitment and retention crisis\" in teaching.",
      "Pepe Di'Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the plans would generate a \"new league table based on the sum of Ofsted judgements across at least 40 points of comparison\".",
      "It would be \"bewildering for teachers and leaders, never mind the parents whose choices these reports are supposedly intended to guide\", he added.",
      "Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the plans would \"do little to reduce the enormous pressure school leaders are under\".",
      "Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the five-point grading scale \"maintains the current blunt, reductive approach that cannot capture the complexity of school life nor provide more meaningful information to parents\".",
      "As well as criticism over its single-word judgements, Sir Martyn has also previously said Ofsted's inspection process should be \"far more empathetic\".",

      "The welfare report said up to 700 million birds, mammals and reptiles are thought to be killed by domestic cats across the UK each year.",
      "Experts from the Scottish Animal Welfare Commission (SAWC) said one possible option might be to keep cats at home in certain rural areas.",
      "The idea of cat containment orders could apply to new housing developments where wildlife, including Scottish wildcats, were at particular risk from the pets.",
      "Other possible measures include compulsory microchipping across Scotland, increasing vaccinations and neutering cats living in vulnerable areas.",
      "The report said: \"New housing developments in rural areas could have a stipulation that cats may not be kept in conservation-sensitive areas/other areas that have not had high levels of predation, especially with red-listed or amber-listed birds/other species.\"",

      "\"Of course, we understand that keeping a cat locked up inside all the time, it is really difficult to provide for their welfare, so it's really about striking a balance between protecting Scottish wildlife and ensuring cats have good welfare,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) said that there are 800 arrests each month relating to threats posed to children online. It said 840,000 adults are a threat to children nationwide - both online and offline - which makes up 1.6% of the adult population.",
      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",

      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",
      "Lynn Perry, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, welcomed government action to tackle AI-produced CSAM \"which normalises the abuse of children, putting more of them at risk, both on and offline\".",
      "\"It is vital that legislation keeps up with technological advances to prevent these horrific crimes,\" she added.",
      "\"Tech companies must make sure their platforms are safe for children. They need to take action to introduce stronger safeguards, and Ofcom must ensure that the Online Safety Act is implemented effectively and robustly.\"",

      "Violent and extremist videos are still online despite government calls for their removal, the home secretary has told the BBC.",
      "Yvette Cooper condemned tech giants for failing to take down disturbing videos, including footage watched by the Southport killer, calling their response \"disgraceful\" and a clear breach of their \"moral responsibilities\".",
      "Last week it emerged that Axel Rudakubana, who murdered three young girls and seriously injured eight other children and two adults at a dance class in July, had watched graphic footage of a knife attack in Australia and downloaded an academic study of an Al-Qaeda training manual.",
      "Cooper told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that, despite her letter to X, Meta, TikTok, Google, and YouTube, much of the harmful content is still available.",

      "In the home secretary's letter, which was co-written with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, Cooper said that, while possession of the al-Qaeda study was illegal under existing anti-terror laws, Rudakubana had been \"able to easily obtain access\" to it.",
      "Kuenssberg asked Cooper why, given her position as home secretary, she appeared to be powerless to stop it. The home secretary said the Online Safety Act, which comes into force this spring, will require social media platforms to remove illegal content. She warned that the government is ready to take further steps if these companies don't comply.",
      "Visibly angry, Cooper said: \"They really should be doing more, but this will mean if they don't, then there will be new penalties brought in. Much stronger action can be taken against them and then further stronger measures on the protection of children later in the year.\"",

      "\"Different organisations all have partial responsibilities, but that network collectively failed to identify the scale of risk that this young man poses.\"",
      "Asked what she proposed as a remedy to the problem, Cooper said \"the system needs to be strengthened.\"",
      "She pointed out that when someone demonstrates clear ideological extremism, such as Islamist extremism, the Prevent programme is well-equipped to intervene. But when individuals, like Rudakubana, show a dangerous obsession with extreme violence \u2013 without a clear ideology \u2013 the current system struggles to address the threat.",
      "\"The impact of what they do may be terrorising in the same way,\" she said, explaining that such individuals can cause widespread fear, even if their motives are not linked to terrorism.",
      "Kuenssberg once again pressed the home secretary on a solution and Cooper acknowledged that, in some cases, mental health services might need to take the lead, while in others, the police or social services should be more involved.",
      "She claimed that the current approach is a legacy of previous failures and suggested that the inception of youth prevention partnerships, which would bring together different agencies, could be a step towards a more coordinated response.",
      "But she said the inquiry into the Southport attack must focus on identifying how the system failed and how future tragedies can be prevented.",
      "\"We are not keeping up with the challenge that we're seeing,\" she said.",
      "Downing Street previously promised action to address these issues. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced at the end of January that the government would look at changing laws to allow perpetrators of \"extreme individualised violence,\" like Rudakubana, to be charged with terrorism offences.",

      "Eileen West has a strange object in her home in Aberdeenshire - a scale model of a huge electricity pylon, built as part of a local campaign against the \"monstrous\" metal structures.",
      "A new pylon line is proposed just a few hundred metres from her home. The steel towers will typically be 187ft (57m) high - significantly taller than most pylons in Scotland. Some could be as high as 246ft (75m).",
      "They are part of a planned 66-mile (106km) route - between the town of Kintore and the village of Tealing - to transfer power from wind farms off the north-east coast of Scotland to where the electricity is needed.",
      "\"I think we're being sacrificed,\" says Eileen, a member of Deeside Against Pylons.",
      "The plans are part of one of the government's key missions, a drive to decarbonise the UK's electricity system by 2030. Just over half of our power currently comes from wind, solar, nuclear and biomass - organic matter.  The government wants to raise that to 95% by 2030 - just five years' time.",
      "The target is ambitious, and controversial. Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, told the BBC it is essential to \"cut bills, tackle the climate crisis and give us energy security\".",
      "But are local concerns being overlooked to meet national objectives?",
      "BBC Panorama has travelled across the UK - to Aberdeenshire, Lincolnshire and Suffolk - to hear from people in landscapes bracing for change, including Oscar-nominated actor Ralph Fiennes.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to take on the \"naysayers\" and \"Nimbys\" [Not in My Back Yard], who he says stand in the way of national growth by making repeated legal challenges to planning decisions.",
      "That message was underscored last week. Chancellor Rachel Reeves vowed to go \"further and faster\" in her effort to deliver the government's growth agenda as she announced a series of potentially controversial new infrastructure projects, including backing plans for a third runway at Heathrow.",
      "A huge construction effort would also be needed to meet the 2030 clean energy target, Mr Miliband told Panorama.",
      "\"You need the solar farms, you need the rooftop solar. You need onshore wind, you need offshore wind, you need nuclear. You need all of these things,\" he says.",
      "It will also mean more pylons, cables and substations. But what about the local communities who told us they felt they were not being heard and feared their concerns would be overridden?",
      "\"The answer is to listen to local people but to make decisions. That's what our country needs,\" Mr Milliband says.",
      "He says the government has committed to provide direct benefits to affected communities via community funds, he adds. People who live near transmission lines could also have discounts on their energy bills.",

      "The Climate Change Committee, an independent body that advises the government on the most efficient way to achieve its climate targets, says the industry has reasons for choosing pylons.",
      "\"One of which is cost, in many cases, it's the cheapest route to delivering clean electricity to people from where it's produced,\" says chief executive Emma Pinchbeck. \"And that's important because ultimately consumers are paying for that infrastructure on their energy bills.",
      "\"The second is technical. We're talking about high voltage lines in many cases. These are really big cables and it's often better for the physics of the energy system to have them up in the air and accessible.\"",
      "On a windswept beach in Suffolk, we meet Oscar-nominated actor Ralph Fiennes, who is part of a group opposing infrastructure plans in the county where he was born and now lives.",
      "\"Governments can, with easy disdain, use the word 'Nimby',\" he says. \"It's easy, but they don't live here.\"",
      "The county is a potential hub for new energy projects. Miles of trenches may be dug for cabling, large new electricity substations and converter stations have been proposed, and plans for offshore wind farms have already been approved.",
      "Like Eileen in Aberdeenshire, Fiennes questions the impact on the local landscape and whether alternatives - like building offshore grid infrastructure and using undersea cabling so the electricity can be brought ashore on former industrial sites - are being overlooked.",
      "\"We need this energy. The planet is lost without it,\" he says. \"But what's the best version of bringing in this green, clean energy?\"",
      "William Rose meets us on the farm in Lincolnshire he has run for more than half a century. Nearby, three large solar farms have been approved and another is proposed. Soon the fields could be full of ordered ranks of metal frames holding millions of shiny solar panels.",
      "Like many other protestors, William isn't opposed to renewable power in principle - he has rooftop solar panels on one of his barns and a small number in a field which power his grain-drying barn.",
      "But he says local farmers are being offered a lot more for hosting solar panels than they could earn growing crops in their fields.",
      "\"Generally on corn arable land, you'd expect a return of maybe \u00a3200 an acre,\" William explains. \"And they're being offered \u00a31,000 an acre a year, index linked for 50 years.\"",
      "But he says this comes at a different cost. \"What they're doing is consigning the countryside to this industrial wasteland of solar panels.\"",

      "This government, though, is not just looking at reforming welfare  - it is preparing to put it at the heart of its economic agenda.",
      "In Rachel Reeves's big speech on growth this week, she vowed that to achieve \"fundamental\" reform of the welfare system, the government would look at areas that have been \"ducked for too long, like the rising cost of health and disability benefits\".",

      "The question is being frantically addressed between the Treasury and the Department of Work of Pensions (DWP) right now.",
      "Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, will present a \"green paper\" - or policy proposals - on welfare reform in just over a month, designed to demonstrate how serious the government is about finding ways to get more people into work - and save money from the welfare budget.",
      "That dual motive explains why this is being treated as such an urgent issue at the top of government.",
      "Ministers are concerned by a situation in which the amount of people who are in receipt of certain benefits has surged. Meanwhile, the Treasury needs to ensure that it is not on course to break its own self-imposed fiscal rules.",
      "\"It's high up the agenda for us because of the cost implications but also the broader economic problem of having so many people economically inactive,\" a Treasury source said.",
      "And in 10 Downing Street, aides say that tackling this issue would be the clearest sign yet that Sir Keir is truly serious about reforming public services.",
      "Last year, the government spent \u00a365bn on sickness benefits - a 25% increase from the year before the pandemic. That figure is forecast to increase to around \u00a3100bn before the next general election.",
      "Some of this is the legacy of Covid. But the chancellor has made clear her view that another reason for this surge is the \"perverse incentives\" wired into the system.",
      "Again and again, ministers and officials complain of a system where those on universal credit are required to display evidence they have applied for jobs, or face sanctions - but people out of work who also qualify for sickness benefits both get more money and are not necessarily required to seek work.",
      "Ministers believe that this encourages some people to \"game the system\". Some Labour advisers fear this issue is being exacerbated, especially among young people, by videos on TikTok and other platforms which explain to claimants the best ways to fill out questionnaires in order to get sickness benefits.",
      "One option officials are examining is whether there should be \u2013 as in the past - a third path whereby some people on sickness benefits are required to seek work - but without the risk that they lose their sickness benefits.",

      "Better training and coaching can help, but the amount of money involved may not sit well with a Treasury that's in savings mode.",

      "As McSweeney, now Sir Keir's chief of staff, found - the Labour Party is deeply committed to the welfare state and deeply anxious about anything which looks like the safety net is fraying.",
      "That's not just true of party members but MPs too. Among the vast 2024 intake of Labour MPs, one of their most common reasons for getting involved in the Labour Party was opposition to Conservative austerity and welfare cuts.",
      "That means that even some of those most loyal to Starmer and Reeves are privately expressing significant anxiety about the direction of travel.",
      "Some of these tensions are beginning to spill into public view.",
      "At PMQs this week Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions select committee, said that \"speculation\" about billions of pounds of savings to be found from the social security budget had left \"many vulnerable claimants [feeling] worried\".",
      "She warned the prime minister that \"language matters\".",
      "Senior Labour figures involved in the discussions are adamant that it is Reeves and Starmer who are in line with public opinion, not concerned Labour MPs.",
      "One complained: \"If you ask Labour MPs whether they'd rather be on the side of the public or on the side of a lot of the Labour movement and vocal disability campaigners - well, for some of them that's a marginal call.\"",
      "Others caution about public opinion on this issue though: \"The public think they support welfare cuts until they hear a story about someone they feel sympathy for losing money. Then they don't.\"",
      "Some older hands warn of how quickly the government could be left out of step with its base, pointing to the party's decision to abstain on a Conservative welfare bill in July 2015.",
      "Such was the scale of Labour members' fury that Conservative welfare cuts were not being opposed, it is seen by many as the main reason that Jeremy Corbyn's longshot leadership campaign took off.",
      "Jon Ashworth, a former shadow cabinet minister who is still close to top party figures, urged the government to put \"helping people move into good, well-paid jobs\" at the heart of their arguments for reform.",
      "He said: \"The welfare system as currently designed traps people out of work and actively denies people who want to work real, genuine help.\"",
      "These political considerations are not new territory for Reeves. She was shadow work and pensions secretary for two years before the 2015 general election.",
      "Her vow that Labour would be \"tougher than the Tories on benefits\" made her deeply controversial with the party's grassroots for years afterwards. Speaking to the New Statesman in 2021, Reeves acknowledged she may have made her point \"badly\", but insisted that \"spending more on benefits wasn't always a sign of success. And actually the benefits bill goes up when society fails.\"",
      "These dilemmas may not be new for Reeves, but they have left some of her colleagues feeling uneasy at best.",

    "title": "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 01:41:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020.",
    "story": [
      "Five years ago, on 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union.",
      "On that day, Great Britain severed the political ties it had held for 47 years, but stayed inside the EU single market and customs union for a further 11 months to keep trade flowing.",
      "Northern Ireland had a separate arrangement.",
      "Brexit was hugely divisive, both politically and socially, dominating political debate and with arguments about its impacts raging for years.",
      "Five years on from the day Britain formally left the EU, BBC Verify has examined five important ways Brexit has affected Britain.",
      "1) Trade",
      "Economists and analysts generally assess the impact of leaving the EU single market and customs union on 1 Jan 2021 on the UK's goods trade as having been negative.",
      "This is despite the fact that the UK negotiated a free trade deal with the EU and avoided tariffs - or taxes - being imposed on the import and export of goods.",
      "The negative impact comes from so-called \"non-tariff barriers\" - time consuming and sometimes complicated new paperwork that businesses have to fill out when importing and exporting to the EU.",
      "There is some disagreement about how negative the specific Brexit impact has been.",
      "Some recent studies suggest that UK goods exports are 30% lower than they would have been if we had not left the single market and customs union.",
      "Some suggest only a 6% reduction.",
      "We can't be certain because the results depend heavily on the method chosen by researchers for measuring the \"counterfactual\", i.e what would have happened to UK exports had the country stayed in the EU.",
      "One thing we can be reasonably confident of is that small UK firms appear to be more adversely affected than larger ones.",
      "They have been less able to cope with the new post-Brexit cross-border bureaucracy. That's supported by surveys of small firms.",
      "It's also clear UK services exports - such as advertising and management consulting - have done unexpectedly well since 2021.",
      "But the working assumption of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's independent official forecaster, is still that Brexit in the long-term will reduce exports and imports of goods and services by 15% relative to otherwise. It has held this view since 2016, including under the previous Government.",
      "And the OBR's other working assumption is that the fall in trade relative to otherwise will reduce the long-term size of the UK economy by around 4% relative to otherwise, equivalent to roughly \u00a3100bn in today's money.",
      "The OBR says it could revise both these assumptions based on new evidence and studies. The estimated negative economic impact could come down if the trade impact judged to be less severe. Yet there is no evidence, so far, to suggest that it will turn into a positive impact.",
      "After Brexit, the UK has been able to strike its own trade deals with other countries.",
      "There have been new trade deals with Australia and New Zealand and the government has been pursuing new agreements with the US and India.",
      "But their impact on the economy is judged by the government's own official impact assessments to be small relative to the negative impact on UK- EU trade.",
      "However, some economists argue there could still be potential longer term economic benefits for the UK from not having to follow EU laws and regulations affecting sectors such as Artificial Intelligence.",
      "2) Immigration",
      "Immigration was a key theme in the 2016 referendum campaign, centred on freedom of movement within the EU, under which UK and EU citizens could freely move to visit, study, work and live.",
      "There has been a big fall in EU immigration and EU net migration (immigration minus emigration) since the referendum and this accelerated after 2020 due to the end of freedom of movement.",
      "But there have been large increases in net migration from the rest of the world since 2020.",
      "A post-Brexit immigration system came into force in January 2021.",
      "Under this system, EU and non-EU citizens both need to get work visas in order to work in the UK (except Irish citizens, who can still live and work in the UK without a visa).",
      "The two main drivers of the increase in non-EU immigration since 2020 are work visas (especially in health and care) and international students and their dependents.",
      "UK universities started to recruit more non-EU overseas students as their financial situation deteriorated.",
      "The re-introduction of the right of overseas students to stay and work in Britain after graduation by Boris Johnson's government also made the UK more attractive to international students.",
      "Subsequent Conservative governments reduced the rights of people on work and student visas to bring dependents and those restrictions have been retained by Labour.",
      "3) Travel",
      "Freedom of movement ended with Brexit, also affecting tourists and business travellers.",
      "British passport holders can no longer use \"EU/EEA/CH\" lanes at EU border crossing points.",
      "People can still visit the EU as a tourist for 90 days in any 180 day period without requiring a visa, provided they have at least three months remaining on their passports at the time of their return.",
      "EU citizens can stay in the UK for up to six months without needing a visa.",
      "However, a bigger change in terms of travel is on the horizon.",
      "In 2025, the EU is planning to introduce a new electronic Entry Exit System (EES) - an automated IT system for registering travellers from non-EU countries.",
      "This will register the person's name, type of the travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit.",
      "It will replace the manual stamping of passports. The impact of this is unclear, but some in the travel sector have expressed fears it could potentially add to border queues as people leave the UK.",
      "The EES was due to be introduced in November 2024 but was postponed until 2025, with no new date for implementation yet set.",
      "And six months after the introduction of EES, the EU says it will introduce a new European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS). UK citizens will have to obtain ETIAS clearance for travel to 30 European countries.",
      "ETIAS clearance will cost \u20ac7 (\u00a35.90) and be valid for up to three years or until someone's passport expires, whichever comes first. If people get a new passport, they need to get a new ETIAS travel authorisation.",
      "Meanwhile, the UK is introducing its equivalent to ETIAS for EU citizens from 2 April 2025 (though Irish citizens will be exempt). The UK permit - to be called an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - will cost \u00a316.",
      "4) Laws",
      "Legal sovereignty - the ability of the UK to make its own laws and not have to follow EU ones - was another prominent Brexit referendum campaign promise.",
      "To minimise disruption immediately following Brexit in 2020, the UK incorporated thousands of EU laws into UK law, becoming known as \"retained EU law\".",
      "According to the latest government count there were 6,901 individual pieces of retained EU law covering things like working time, equal pay, food labelling and environmental standards.",
      "The previous Conservative government initially set a deadline of the end of 2023 to axe these EU laws.",
      "But with so much legislation to consider there was concern there was not enough time to review all the laws properly.",
      "In May 2023 Kemi Badenoch - the Trade Secretary at the time - announced only 600 EU laws would be axed by the end of 2023, with another 500 financial services laws set to disappear later.",
      "Most were relatively obscure regulations and many of them had been superseded or become irrelevant.",
      "All other EU legislation was kept, though ministers reserved powers to change them in future.",
      "And the UK has changed some EU laws. For example, it banned the export of live animals from Great Britain for slaughter and fattening and changed EU laws on gene editing crops.",
      "Brexit has also given the UK more freedom in certain areas of tax law.",
      "EU member states are prohibited from charging VAT on education under an EU directive. Leaving the EU enabled Labour to impose VAT on private school fees.",
      "A zero rate of VAT on tampons and other sanitary products was introduced by the UK government in 2021. This would not have been possible in the EU as the EU VAT Directive at the time mandated a minimum 5% tax on all sanitary products. However, in April 2022 the EU's rules changed so the bloc also now allows a zero rate on sanitary products.",
      "5) Money",
      "The money the UK sent to the EU was a controversial theme in the 2016 referendum, particularly the Leave campaign's claim the UK sent \u00a3350m every week to Brussels.",
      "The UK's gross public sector contribution to the EU Budget in 2019-20, the final financial year before Brexit, was \u00a318.3bn, equivalent to around \u00a3352m per week, according to the Treasury.",
      "The UK continued paying into the EU Budget during the transition period but since 31 December 2020 it has not made these contributions.",
      "However, those EU Budgets contributions were always partially recycled to the UK via payments to British farmers under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and \"structural funding\" - development grants to support skills, employment and training in certain economically disadvantaged regions of the nation. These added up to \u00a35bn in 2019-20.",
      "Since the end of the transition period UK governments have replaced the CAP payments directly with taxpayer funds.",
      "Ministers have also replaced the EU structural funding grants, with the previous government rebranding them as \"a UK Shared Prosperity\" fund.",
      "The UK was also receiving a negotiated \"rebate\" on its EU Budget contributions of around \u00a34bn a year - money which never actually left the country,",
      "So the net fiscal benefit to the UK from not paying into the EU Budget is closer to to \u00a39bn per year, although this figure is inherently uncertain because we don't know what the UK's contribution to the EU Budget would otherwise have been.",
      "The UK has also still been paying the EU as part of the official Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and its financial settlement. The Treasury says the UK paid a net amount of \u00a314.9bn between 2021 and 2023, and estimated that from 2024 onwards it will have to pay another \u00a36.4bn, although spread over many years.",
      "Future payments under the withdrawal settlement are also uncertain in part because of fluctuating exchange rates.",
      "However, there are other ways the UK's finances remained connected with the EU, separate from the EU Budget and the Withdrawal Agreement.",
      "After Brexit took effect, the UK also initially stopped paying into the Horizon scheme, which funds pan-European scientific research.",
      "However, Britain rejoined Horizon in 2023 and is projected by the EU to pay in around \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) per year on average to the EU budget for its participation, although historically the UK has been a net financial beneficiary from the scheme because of the large share of grants won by UK-based scientists.",
      "The future",
      "There are, of course, a large number of other Brexit impacts which we have not covered here, ranging from territorial fishing rights, to farming, to defence. And with Labour looking for a re-set in EU relations, it's a subject that promises to be a continuing source of debate and analysis for many years to come.",

      "When Labour swept to victory last summer, Reeves pledged she would be an \"iron\" chancellor, reining in public spending and improving the lives of working people through growing the economy. Without solid public finances, she argued, the government couldn't achieve any of its other aims.",
      "This month has tested that plan.",
      "It started off with a global bond market tantrum - UK borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years and the pound fell sharply.",
      "Some argued that Reeves's Budget decisions had made the UK more vulnerable to such shocks. The prime minister was forced to confirm Reeves had his backing after political opponents called for her resignation.",
      "The market turbulence sparked concerns that a verdict of sorts was being made on the chancellor.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this Parliament. That meant, the rise in global and UK debt interest costs would require some spending cuts.",
      "The message was sent out that the government, with its massive majority, could do and would do what it takes to keep to the self-imposed rules, which it said were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "The markets have now recovered all their negative moves. Short term and long term government borrowing costs are all lower than at the beginning of the year.",
      "While the \"gilt crisis\" hyperbole was overdone, there have been consequences.",
      "From doom to promises of a boom",
      "The chancellor sped up an already planned \"drumbeat\" of pro-growth measures, culminating in this week's speech. Reeves's counsel of doom and warnings about black holes and pain has been replaced by a promise of an investment boom.",
      "She has vowed a new runway at Heathrow, visas for those with AI and life science skills and said she would ease the non-dom ban to allow a more generous phase out of tax benefits.",
      "Alongside this are plans to make it easier to build, delays to new rules on banks and the ousting of the boss of the competition regulator, which shows she's serious on growth. As Meatloaf might have scripted for her: \"I would do anything for growth\".",
      "But Reeves's plans are not yet a fully fledged growth plan. Her announcements signal that she is willing to take a series of political hits to foster long term growth.",
      "The chancellor will deploy the near total executive power from her party's commons majority to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Some outside advisers who support the chancellor say that stability is not enough, and nor is planning, and nor is deregulation.",
      "Reeves has not pledged any allocation of public money to these grand projects.",
      "Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye sounded a little coy after plans for a third runway were confirmed, saying they would not spend more money on it unless they really believed it was going to happen.",
      "\"This will take years, it will take what I call Churchillian resolve and lots of ingenuity but we can trust a government that will be with us for many years to deliver this,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Reeves is focusing on a very specific type of growth - increasing the supply of goods and services. She believes a lack of this supply side growth has held back the UK, and she is on a mission to remove barriers, and open new markets.",
      "For example, Reeves is very concerned about small businesses who have told her they have given up on exporting to the EU, because post Brexit it is now easier to export to the US.",
      "At a meeting last week, one business told the chancellor that exports to Europe meant for Christmas, had only just arrived.",
      "The problem is that while the chancellor awaits a long term growth spurt, she has prioritised stabilising public finances through significant tax rises.",
      "In April, employers will be hit with an increase in national insurance payments and a higher minimum wage. These costs could be passed on in price rises meaning inflation - already higher than target at 2.5%, could remain sticky.",
      "Reeves would have preferred employers to squeeze pay settlements rather than raise prices or cut staff.",
      "Retail and hospitality businesses using low wage labour will be most impacted by the bumper rise in minimum wages. Downing Street insiders acknowledge that many domestic business bosses are \"grumpy\" as they put it.",
      "The concern is whether the impact will show up in higher unemployment. At last October's Budget, the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted extra government spending would help boost the economy and bring unemployment down to 4% this year. Some outside forecasters now think it will top 5%.",
      "It is a critical few months for the animal spirits in the economy to reignite.",
      "How far will she go?",
      "But how far is Rachel Reeves willing to push this pro-growth agenda?",
      "Will she follow the US away from the decarbonisation path to benefit from cheaper hydrocarbon prices promised by President Trump? Will she accede to construction industry requests to import foreign workers to meet the target to build 1.5 million homes?",
      "Will she push the Brexit reset to remove all the barriers to UK-EU trade in food and farm products, and many goods too? Will she offer Britain to the global tech and pharma industries as a deregulatory haven from the EU and US respectively?",
      "Taken at face value, she will do most of this, with big political consequences. Take the Brexit reset. Cabinet ministers at The World Economic Forum were delighted with the tone of the EU's new trade chief Maros Sefcovic in his interview with me, saying he was open to Britain joining the Pan-Euro-Mediterranean Convention (PEM).",
      "The arrangement allows for tariff-free trade of some goods from across dozens of countries in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.",
      "But if the UK demanded effective single market treatment in certain sectors, it would need to follow the EU rule book in those areas. There would be counter asks, such as extending EU fishing arrangements in UK waters, and some sort of youth cultural exchange scheme.",
      "The need for delicate diplomacy",
      "Push is coming to shove on these issues, and the question is whether the chancellor's pro growth agenda is the overwhelming factor in making decisions. I suspect it is.",
      "However, that approach will require delicate diplomacy in the middle of a potential goods tariff war. If Trump follows through on his threat of a universal tariff then the G7 could decide to coordinate retaliatory tariffs. Does the UK join in?",
      "What if the US decides it wants its allies to help contain China's tech ascendancy? What if Trump wants to deter the UK from rebuilding free-flowing trade with the EU?",
      "The sudden emergence of China's AI expertise via DeepSeek underlines how important it is to be nimble. There was only one mention of China in the government's big AI paper earlier this month - in Science Secretary Peter Kyle's foreword.",
      "The pharma industry is lobbying the government to quietly open the door for relocation of key top talent into the UK, concerned about the Trump / Robert F Kennedy Jr approach to medicines regulation. Our leading universities are saying that for the first time since Brexit, it's easier to recruit some of the very best international scientists who are not keen to bring up their families in Trump's America.",
      "Trump's decision to abandon Biden's green subsidies also levels the playing field for net zero investment here.",
      "After a tumultuous start to the year, with the US administration threatening different tariffs almost every day, and tech giant shares falling over concerns they've been overvalued in the light of China's AI app DeepSeek, the UK remains a safe haven for investors.",
      "The self declared iron chancellor remains very attached to stability. But zero growth is a form of stability too. In choppy global seas, going for growth is going to require some very tricky navigation - and it will make some big domestic political waves too.",

    "summary": "The chancellor announced a range of reforms on Wednesday - including a new runway for Heathrow airport.",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",

      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",

      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 17:02:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The asteroid named YR4 has a 1% chance of hitting Earth in 2032",
    "story": [
      "UN planetary defence organisations are closely monitoring an asteroid that has a tiny risk of hitting the Earth.",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) has said that it has an almost 99% chance of safely passing Earth on 22 December 2032, but a possible impact \"cannot yet be entirely ruled out\".",
      "The probability that the asteroid, called 2024 YR4, may impact Earth on 22 December 2032 is currently estimated to be 1.3%.",
      "Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society, says that he is \"not panicking or losing sleep over it\".",
      "\"There is no need for alarm,\" he said. \"The thing about this kind of event is that historically they tend to go away when the calculations are refined.\"",
      "We need to be aware alert and we need to give astronomers the resources they need to track these kinds of threats so that we can take action as soon as possible.\"",
      "YR4 was detected on 27 December 2024. Astronomers calculated that it was between 40m and 90m across. This would have the power of a nuclear bomb were it to hit the Earth and cause severe damage if the impact was in a populated area.",
      "But it is much more likely that YR4 would fall into the ocean or a remote part of the planet. It is too far away from Earth and there are too many uncertainties at this stage to determine where a potential impact could occur in the unlikely event of a collision.",
      "Since early January, astronomers have been using telescopes to calculate the asteroid's size and trajectory more precisely. YR4 is now rated at level 3 out of 10 on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale: \"a close encounter that warrants attention from astronomers and the public\". A collision is only certain when it reaches 8, 9 or 10, with the numbers rising in line with the damage likely caused.",
      "When asteroids are initially calculated to have a small probability of hitting the Earth, that impact probability usually drops to zero after additional observations.",
      "This happened in 2004 when an asteroid called Apophis was calculated to have a 2.7% chance of striking Earth in 2029; further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "Any object that may be more than 50m wide and has a greater than 1% chance of hitting the Earth, triggers a set of precautionary measures. These are to ensure that the threat, however tiny, is closely monitored and, if necessary, steps are taken to nullify it.",
      "The first stage is to activate two UN-endorsed asteroid reaction groups: the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), chaired by Nasa, and the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), chaired by the European Space Agency.",
      "The SMPAG is having a series of meetings this week to determine its next steps.  It has already concluded that it is too early to take immediate action but said that it would \"monitor the evolution of impact threat and possible knowledge about the size closely\".",
      "Another meeting to take decisions on future activities will be held towards the end of April or early May, or earlier, \"if the evolution of the threat merits\".",
      "If the asteroid's impact probability remains above the 1% threshold, SMPAG will provide recommendations to the UN and may begin to evaluate options.",
      "In the unlikely event YR4 were headed our way, one option would be to divert it by hitting it with a robotic spacecraft, as was successfully tested out with Nasa's Dart mission in 2022. That changed the course of an asteroid that was not on a collision course with the Earth.",
      "\"Nasa's Dart mission showed that we have the means to divert an asteroid, but only if we spot it early enough,\" says Dr Massey.",
      "YR4 is currently moving away from Earth in almost a straight line, making it difficult to accurately determine its precise orbit before it returns towards Earth.",
      "Over the next few months, the asteroid will begin to fade from view, after which  it will be monitored by ground and space telescopes.",
      "According to ESA \"It is possible that asteroid 2024 YR4 will fade from view before we are able to entirely rule out any chance of impact in 2032. In this case, the asteroid will likely remain on ESA's risk list until it becomes observable again in 2028.\""

      "Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.",
      "He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 \u2013 a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (\u00a3160m) for \u2013 and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date \u2013 most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.",
      "\"We want it to be 600,000,\" he told reporters.",
      "Later, he added: \"I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species\u2026 I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.\"",
      "Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (\u00a31.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.",
      "Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule and performing the first commercial spacewalk.",
      "During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.",
      "The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic \u2013 it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.",
      "And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still \u2013 being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.",
      "The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do \u2013 especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX owner Elon Musk to a government role to cut $2 trillion (\u00a31.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.",
      "The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.",
      "Brink of a second space age?",
      "In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.",
      "Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.",
      "And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.",
      "They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.",
      "On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. \"This second space age has only just begun,\" he wrote.",
      "\"There will inevitably be a thriving space economy \u2013 one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space\u2026 At Nasa, we will\u2026 usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.\"",
      "Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, but Trump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.",
      "But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.",
      "That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.",
      "\"You have a government looking to slash,\" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. \"If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget\u2026",
      "\"This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.\"",
      "Future of Nasa's moon rocket",
      "One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (\u00a33.3bn) for each and every launch.",
      "By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (\u00a380m) per launch \u2013 and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (\u00a38m) as he develops his system.",
      "Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (\u00a354.5m).",
      "Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.",
      "Starship and New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But \"that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs\", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.",
      "\"SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,\" he continues. \"They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.",
      "\"A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.",
      "\"There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.\"",
      "Questions around spiralling costs",
      "The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: \"Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.",
      "\"Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (\u00a320bn) for key activities\".",
      "Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration \u2013 some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (\u00a3800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 \u2013 but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of \"the telescope that ate astronomy\".",
      "(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)",
      "It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.",
      "Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.",
      "But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. \"Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.\"",
      "New light on the 'old way of doing things'",
      "The current model is to give so-called \"cost-plus\" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.",
      "The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that took Apollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.",
      "Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.",
      "\"We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.\"",
      "Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.",
      "Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.",
      "The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.",
      "SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years \u2013 only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.",
      "The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.",
      "\"Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,\" says Prof Logsdon. \"So, shaking up the system is very positive.\"",
      "On the brink of a big shakeup?",
      "Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS \"outrageously expensive\" and said that the major aerospace contractors are \"incentivised to be economically inefficient\".",
      "But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (\u00a320bn) annual budget.",
      "\"Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,\" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.",
      "Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.",
      "The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.",
      "\"The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,\" argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.\"",
      "Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy \u2013 Musk \u2013 seated nearby.",
      "Others fear cuts in Nasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.",
      "Where SpaceX fits in",
      "There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (\u00a316bn) in contracts from government since 2008.",
      "But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.",
      "And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.",
      "But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.",
      "\"Isaacman is his own man,\" he adds. \"He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.\"",
      "Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution",
      "Friends reunited? Trump faces a very different Kim Jong Un this time",
      "Future of space travel: Could robots really replace human astronauts?",
      "Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue \u2013 Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.",
      "But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.",
      "\"Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,\" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. \"That is frustrating for all of us.\"",
      "Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: \"Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.",
      "\"The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things \u2013 and there are so many hard things\".",

      "A Scottish scheme was originally meant to be operational by 2023 but was delayed after objections from businesses to the inclusion of glass.",
      "It then emerged that the UK government was considering blocking Scotland's plans because it wanted a single scheme for all four nations.",

    "published": "Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:45:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Some scientists fear the risk of a collapse to warm Atlantic currents has not been taken seriously.",
    "story": [
      "Of all the possible climate futures, there's a scenario where the United Kingdom and north-west Europe buck the trend of global warming and instead face plunging temperatures and freezing winters.",
      "It's not the most likely outcome, but a number of scientists fear that the chance of it happening is growing, and that the consequences would be so great that it deserves proper consideration.",
      "They are concerned that the ocean currents that bring warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic could weaken - or even collapse - in response to climate change.",
      "Huge uncertainties remain about when - or even whether - a collapse could happen. So, how likely is it, and what would it mean?",
      "The system of Atlantic currents, called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), is a key reason why the UK is warmer than Moscow, despite being a similar distance from the Equator.",
      "Forming a vital part of our climate system, this conveyor belt distributes energy around the planet, bringing warm, salty water from the tropical Atlantic to cooler regions south of Greenland and Iceland, and also the Nordic Seas.",
      "The warmth from the ocean is transferred to the air above it, helping keep temperatures milder than they otherwise would be.",
      "As this salty water cools, it becomes denser, and sinks, before flowing back towards the southern hemisphere as a deep ocean current. This water eventually gets pulled back up to the surface, and the circulation continues.",
      "But Amoc appears to be getting weaker.",
      "We don't know for sure, because direct and continuous measurements of Amoc strength have only been taken since 2004. That's not long enough to be able to identify a definite change.",
      "But indirect evidence suggests it could have already slowed by around 15% over the last couple of centuries, although not all scientists agree.",
      "One indication is the sediments on the ocean floor. Larger grains indicate a stronger current. By measuring the size of the grains and calculating their age, scientists can estimate how much Amoc has slowed over time.",
      "Another piece of evidence is the so-called 'cold blob' or 'warming hole' in the north Atlantic. This describes a region which appears to have cooled in recent decades, unlike the vast majority of the world.",
      "A slowdown in Amoc - meaning less warmer water would be transported to this region - is seen as a possible culprit.",
      "This is \"a very clear signature and footprint of a classic Amoc slowdown\" says Matthew England, professor of oceanography at the University of New South Wales.",
      "The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects Amoc to weaken this century. But the major concern is that Amoc could suddenly \"switch off\", as appears to have happened repeatedly in the Earth's past.",
      "Today, global warming appears to be making the water in the north Atlantic less salty, due to extra freshwater from a melting Greenland ice sheet and more rainfall.",
      "As fresher water doesn't sink as easily, this is expected to slow the circulation and so bring less saltwater northwards from the tropics.",
      "Beyond a \"tipping point\", this loop could lead Amoc to runaway collapse.",
      "\"We really want to avoid a tipping point because then there's nothing we can do about it,\" warns David Thornalley, professor of ocean and climate science at University College London.",
      "Where might the tipping point be?",
      "No one really knows how close it may be.",
      "In 2021, the IPCC said it had \"medium confidence\" that Amoc would not collapse abruptly this century, although it expected it to weaken.",
      "But some more recent studies have pointed to a growing possibility of Amoc passing a tipping point in the coming decades, beyond which full collapse would be inevitable.",
      "Each study comes with various caveats and uncertainties, and different climate models can give different results for a system as complex as Amoc.",
      "\"We don't believe the idea of an Amoc collapse this century has substantially changed because of these new results,\" cautions Dr Laura Jackson, oceanographer at the Met Office.",
      "But many scientists are growing increasingly concerned. Prof Thornalley argues that, whatever the imperfections of individual studies, taken together they \"lead to a conclusion that we maybe need to be worried\".",
      "Following the new evidence, more than 40 leading ocean and climate scientists signed an open letter last October calling for wider recognition of the \"greatly underestimated\" risks.",
      "That is not to say the signatories believe Amoc will pass a tipping point this century. But they warn it is now enough of a possibility to warrant proper consideration.",
      "\"I'd say you're looking at a risk of reaching a tipping point in the coming decades that could be at the 10 or 20% level even if we hold the line at 2C warming [above temperatures of the late 19th Century, before humans started significantly warming the climate],\" warns Tim Lenton, professor of Earth system science at the University of Exeter.",
      "Given the magnitude of the consequences from Amoc collapse, these probabilities \"are not trivial,\" he adds.",
      "What would happen if Amoc collapsed?",
      "Even the most likely scenario - where Amoc continues to weaken this century - could have serious effects.",
      "\"If the Amoc gradually weakens over the next century, you're going to get global warming but less warming over Europe,\" says Dr Jackson.",
      "That would still mean the UK getting hotter summers with climate change, but a weaker Amoc could also fuel more winter storms as regional temperature patterns change.",
      "A full-scale collapse, meanwhile, would be \"like a war situation [\u2026] something almost unimaginable,\" says Prof Lenton.",
      "While it could take a century or more for impacts to play out, temperatures in northern Europe could fall by a couple of degrees a decade.",
      "In the UK, it could \"become horribly, horribly cold \u2026 like living in northern Norway,\" Prof Thornalley warns.",
      "\"Our infrastructure is not set up for that.\"",
      "There could be global consequences too, such as shifts to the tropical rain belts.",
      "\"That's a big story,\" warns Prof Lenton.",
      "\"If you lost the monsoon or seriously disrupted it, you'd have humanitarian catastrophes, in simple terms, in west Africa [and] probably in India.\"",
      "How we prepare for this alternative future poses challenges for governments.",
      "Prof Lenton draws parallels with preparations for the Covid-19 pandemic - another major event which scientists had warned about, but had no way of knowing when it might occur.",
      "But a recent report warned the UK has a \"glaring national security blind spot for climate threats\" such as those posed by Amoc collapse. The government admitted last year that it \"has not assessed the effect of any [Amoc] slowing or collapse\" on economic planning.",
      "Scientists are clear that the fundamental way to reduce these risks is to cut the greenhouse gas emissions causing climate change.",
      "\"We're playing a bit of a Russian roulette game,\" warns Prof England.",
      "\"The more we stack up the atmosphere with greenhouse gases, the more we warm the system, the more chance we have of an Amoc slowdown and collapse.",

      "While they found that infections occurred more often in unvaccinated birds, they also found that in countries with high vaccination rates, there was a higher rate of change in the virus itself.",
      "They said such evolution could, in theory, lead to vaccines needing to be updated frequently to remain effective and to the virus spilling over into unvaccinated populations. They acknowledged that more research was needed to establish whether there was a direct causal link between vaccination and virus evolution.",

      "Billions of dollars were wiped off  stock markets internationally, including in Australia, where stocks tied to AI - such as chipmaker Brainchip - fell sharply overnight.",
      "The Australian government has insisted the ban is not due to the app's Chinese origins but because of the \"unacceptable risk\" it poses to national security.",
      "DeepSeek has been approached for comment.",
      "Australia's move specifically requires any government entities to \"prevent the use or installation of DeepSeek products, applications and web services\", as well as remove any previously installed, on any government system or device.",
      "That means a wide range of workers will not be able to use the tools in the country, including those working in such varied areas as the Australia Electoral Commission and Bureau of Meteorology.",
      "It is less clear whether it means DeepSeek would be banned from public sector computers in different areas of the economy, such as schools.",
      "The ban does not extend to devices of private citizens.",
      "\"This is increasingly the approach adopted by governments whenever there is any question over security,\" said Kieren McCarthy from cyber intelligence firm Oxford Information Labs.",

      "Western countries have a track record of being suspicious of Chinese tech - notably telecoms firm Huawei and the social media platform, TikTok - both of which have been restricted on national security grounds.",
      "The initial reaction to DeepSeek - which quickly became the most downloaded free app in the UK and US - appeared to be different.",
      "President Donald Trump described it as a \"wake up call\" for the US but said overall it could be a positive development, if it lowered AI costs.",
      "Since then, though, doubts about it have started to be voiced.",
      "An Australian science minister previously said in January that countries needed to be \"very careful\" about DeepSeek, citing \"data and privacy\" concerns.",

      "Regulators in South Korea, Ireland and France have all begun investigations into how DeepSeek handles user data, which it stores in servers in China.",

    "summary": "Some people didn't expect it to last a year. Here's how the popular life simulator has stayed alive.",
    "story": [
      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",
      "\"That's been so wonderful that I have been able to tell my stories and connect with people and they can see themselves represented,\" she says.",
      "The Sims has come in for more criticism over the years for its racial representation.",
      "American content creator Amira, known as Xmiramira online, created a custom skin tone pack for The Sims 4 that's still used by many players today.",
      "\"I couldn't make Sims that either look similar to me or my family, friends. And that's the case in a lot of games,\" says Amira.",
      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",

      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",

      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The Microsoft co-founder says he enjoys giving away his fortune and it won't leave his kids poor.",
    "story": [
      "It's towards the end of our interview that Bill Gates reveals new numbers on how much his charitable Foundation has now spent in its efforts to combat preventable diseases and reduce poverty.",
      "\"I've given over 100 billion,\" he says, \"but I still have more to give.\"",
      "That's dollars, just to clarify, worth about \u00a380bn.",
      "It's roughly equivalent to the size of the Bulgarian economy or the cost of building the whole HS2 line.",
      "But to put it in context, it's also around the same as just one year of Tesla sales. (Tesla owner Elon Musk is now the richest man on the planet, a position Gates held for many years.)",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and his fellow philanthropist Warren Buffett are combining their billions through the Gates Foundation he originally set up with his now ex-wife Melinda.",
      "Gates says philanthropy was instilled in him early on. His mother regularly told him \"with wealth came the responsibility to give it away\".",
      "His Foundation's 25th anniversary is in May, and Gates exclusively revealed the $100bn figure to the BBC.",
      "He tells me, for his part, he enjoys giving his money away (and around $60 billion of his fortune has gone into the Foundation so far).",
      "When it comes to his day-to-day lifestyle, he doesn't actually notice the difference: \"I made no personal sacrifice. I didn't order less hamburgers or less movies.\" He can also, of course, still afford his private jet and his various huge houses.",
      "He plans to give away \"the vast majority\" of his fortune, but tells me he has talked \"a lot\" with his three children about what might be the right amount to leave them.",
      "Will they be poor after he's gone? I ask him. \"They will not,\" he replies with a quick smile, adding \"in absolute, they'll do well, in percentage terms it's not a gigantic number\".",
      "Gates is a maths guy and it shows. At Lakeside School in Seattle, in eighth grade, he competed in a four-state regional maths exam and did so well that, at 13, he was one of the best high school maths students of any age in the region.",
      "Maths terminology comes second nature to him. But to translate, if you're worth $160bn, which Bloomberg's Billionaires Index claims he is, even leaving your children a tiny percentage of your fortune still makes them very rich.",
      "I'm with one of only 15 people on the planet who are centibillionaires (worth more than $100bn), according to Bloomberg. We're in his childhood home in Seattle, a mid-century modern four-bedroom house set into a hill, and we're meeting because he's written a memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, focusing on his early life.",
      "I want to find out what shaped a challenging, obsessive child who didn't fit the norm into one of the tech pioneers of our age.",
      "He's brought along his sisters, Kristi and Libby, and all three excitedly tour the home where they grew up. They haven't been back in some years and the current owners have refurbished (fortunately, the Gates siblings seem to approve of the changes).",
      "But it's bringing back memories including, as they walk into the kitchen, of the now-long-gone intercom system between rooms beloved by their mother. She used it to \"sing to us in the morning\", Gates tells me, to get them out of their bedrooms for breakfast.",
      "Mary Gates also set their watches and clocks eight minutes fast so the family would work to her time. Her son often rebelled at her efforts to improve him, but now tells me \"the crucible of my ambition was warmed through that relationship\".",
      "He puts his competitive spirit down to his grandmother \"Gami\", who was often with the family in this house and who taught him to outsmart the competition early on with games of cards.",
      "I follow him down the wooden stairs as he heads off to find his old childhood bedroom in the basement. It's a neat guest room now, but young Bill spent hours, even days, in here \"thinking\", as his sisters put it.",
      "At one point, his mum was so fed up with the mess that she confiscated any item of clothing she found on the floor and charged her stubborn son 25 cents to buy it back. \"I started wearing fewer clothes,\" he says.",
      "By this time, he was hooked on coding and, with some tech-savvy school friends, had been given access to a local firm's one computer in return for reporting any problems. Obsessed with learning to program in those nascent days of the tech revolution, he would sneak out at night through his bedroom window without his parents knowing to get more computer time.",
      "\"Do you think you could do it now?\" I ask.",
      "He starts unwinding the catch and opens the window. \"It's not that hard,\" he says with a smile as he climbs up and out. \"It's not hard at all.\"",
      "There is a famous early clip of Gates in which a TV presenter asks him if it's true he can jump over a chair from a standing position. He does it right there in the studio. I'm in the Gates childhood bedroom for something that feels like \"a moment\". The guy's nearly 70. But he's still game.",
      "He seems at ease - and it isn't just because we're in a familiar environment. In the memoir, he's revealed publicly for the first time that he thinks if he were growing up today, he'd probably be diagnosed on the autism spectrum.",
      "The only time I met him before was in 2012. He barely looked me in the eye as we did a quick interview about his goal to protect children from life-threatening diseases. There was certainly no pre-interview small talk. I wondered after our interaction whether he was on the spectrum.",
      "The book lays it out: his ability to hyperfocus on subjects he was interested in; his obsessive nature; his lack of social awareness.",
      "He says at elementary school he turned in a 177-page report on Delaware, having written off for brochures about the state, even sending stamped addressed envelopes to local companies asking for their annual reports. He was 11.",
      "His sisters tell me they knew he was different. Kristi, who's older, says she felt protective of him. \"He was not a normal kid\u2026 he would sit in his room and chew pencils down to the lead,\" she said.",
      "They're obviously close. Libby, a therapist, tells me she wasn't surprised to hear he believes he is on the spectrum. \"The surprise was more his willingness to say 'this might be the case',\" she says.",
      "Gates says he hasn't had a formal diagnosis and doesn't plan to. \"The positive characteristics for my career have been more beneficial than the deficits have been a problem for me,\" he says.",
      "He thinks neurodiversity is \"certainly\" over-represented in Silicon Valley because \"learning something in great depth at a young age - that helps you in certain complex subjects\".",
      "Elon Musk has also said he is on the spectrum, referencing Asperger's syndrome. The Tesla, X and SpaceX billionaire is famously courting Donald Trump, as are the other modern-day tech bros, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos among other Silicon Valley attendees at Trump's inauguration.",
      "Gates tells me although \"you can be cynical\" about their motives, he too reached out to the president. They had a three-hour dinner on 27 December \"because he's making decisions about global health and how we help poor countries, which is a big focus of mine now\".",
      "I ask Gates, himself a target of some pretty wild conspiracy theories, what he thinks of the decision taken by Zuckerberg after Trump's election to dump fact-checking in the US on his sites. Gates tells me he's not \"that impressed\" by how governments or private companies are navigating the boundaries between free speech and truth.",
      "\"I don't personally know how you draw that line, but I'm worried that we're not handling that as well as we should,\" he says.",
      "He also thinks children should be protected from social media, telling me there's a \"good chance\" that banning under-16s, as Australia is doing, is \"a smart thing\".",
      "Gates tells me \"social networking, even more than video gaming, can absorb your time and make you worry about other people approving you\" so we have to be \"very careful how it gets used\".",
      "As for Trump's first pick for US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who claims he isn't anti-vaccination but has promoted debunked claims about vaccines, Gates makes short shrift. He tells me RFK Jr is \"misleading people\".",
      "The Bill Gates origin story isn't rags to riches. His dad was a lawyer, money wasn't tight, although the decision to send their son to private school to try to motivate him was \"a stretch, even on my father's salary\".",
      "If they hadn't, we might never have heard of Bill Gates.",
      "He first got access to an early mainframe computer via a teletype machine at the school, after the mothers held a jumble sale to raise the money. The teachers couldn't figure it out, but four students were on it day and night. \"We got to use computers when almost nobody else did,\" he says.",
      "Much later, he would set up Microsoft with one of those school friends, Paul Allen. Another, Kent Evans, Gates' best friend, would die tragically age 17 in a climbing accident. As we walk around Lakeside School, we pass the chapel where they held his funeral and where Gates remembers crying on the steps.",
      "Together, they'd had big plans. When they weren't on computers, they were reading biographies to work out what factors made people successful.",
      "Now Gates has written his own. His philosophy? \"Much of who you are was there from the start.\"",

      "But that's what happened with Dynasty Warriors, a series which pioneered the so-called \"1 vs 1,000\" gameplay, in which the player defeats thousands of enemies in each level.",
      "Throughout years of development - the series has been going since 1997 on the original PlayStation - hardware limitations meant at its best only a few hundred enemies could appear on-screen at any one time.",
      "But all that is now changing, with the power of modern consoles enabling as many as 10,000 opponents on-screen at once.",
      "In other words, the \"1 vs 1,000\" moniker is finally coming true.",

      "The reason Dynasty Warriors: Origins seeks to break away from what came before is simple, Mr Sho said - it was a result of fan reaction to the last mainline game released in the series, 2018's Dynasty Warriors 9.",
      "\"Either you really liked it, or you didn't,\" he said.",
      "The unreleased sequel was too similar to what came before, he said, but by the time development was in full swing, a change in the games industry ultimately halted production.",
      "Within two days of each other in November 2020, Sony released the PlayStation 5 and Microsoft launched the Xbox Series X - consoles so powerful Mr Sho ceased development to focus on the new hardware.",
      "\"The current technology allows us to have many troops and army officers on the screen,\" he said.",
      "\"This is something I've been wanting to do since Dynasty Warriors 2 and 3.\"",
      "Those two games, which released on PlayStation 2 back in 2000 and 2001, could at most manage twenty or thirty enemies on-screen at once.",
      "The new hardware can manage a lot more - with PlayStation 5 Pro owners seeing an even bigger leap in performance.",
      "\"We're able to have many troops on-screen - not just thousands, but tens of thousands,\" Mr Sho said.",
      "\"With the current generation of consoles, we're able to do that.\"",
      "But all that power comes with a cost - no multiplayer, which has been a staple of the series since its PlayStation 2 days.",
      "\"I am very aware that it is seen as an iconic part of the series,\" he said.",
      "He felt multiplayer would result in a \"performance loss\", meaning fewer enemies on screen, so he decided against including it.",
      "But he said that may change if the game were given a sequel.",
      "\"If everyone really enjoys the game, then for the next game in the series, we will definitely have multiplayer,\" he said.",
      "Spin-offs and future",
      "In the interim years between the release of Dynasty Warriors 9 and Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the team has focussed on other things - namely spin-offs.",
      "These are versions of the game, within the 1 vs 1,000 genre, outside of the main series that typically feature different characters - much like how the film franchise Puss in Boots was a spin-off of Shrek.",
      "The company has found success in this area with games featuring characters from series such as Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda and Sega's Persona 5.",
      "Mr Sho said Dynasty Warriors: Origins was a shift in direction as it focused on performance - while spin-offs were about being true to the franchises involved.",
      "\"When the teams were approaching development, they weren't thinking about the hardware,\" he said.",
      "\"But more, with Hyrule Warriors and Fire Emblem Warriors being on the Switch, how would we be able to do that best as a Warriors game?\"",
      "He said Dynasty Warriors' future was about \"getting the most\" out of current consoles - perhaps with even more enemies on screen.",
      "Though he laughed off the suggestion that perhaps the studio should consider collaborating on the ultimate \"spin-off\" - a Sonic the Hedgehog game.",
      "\"I also actually like Sonic, just to let you know,\" he said.",
      "And Mr Sho said if he could make any Dynasty Warriors spin-off, there are two series he's huge fans of - Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.",
      "\"If there is a chance, I'd definitely love to take on the challenge,\" he said."

    "summary": "Yvette Cooper says the UK will make it illegal to own AI tools to make images of child sexual abuse.",
    "story": [
      "Four new laws will tackle the threat of child sexual abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the government has announced.",
      "The Home Office says the UK will be the first country in the world to make it illegal to possess, create or distribute AI tools designed to create child sexual abuse material (CSAM), with a punishment of up to five years in prison.",
      "Possessing AI paedophile manuals - which teach people how to use AI for sexual abuse - will also be made illegal, and offenders will get up to three years in prison.",
      "\"What we're seeing is that AI is now putting the online child abuse on steroids,\" Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.",
      "Cooper said AI was \"industrialising the scale\" of sexual abuse against children and said government measures \"may have to go further.\"",
      "Other laws set to be introduced include making it an offence to run websites where paedophiles can share child sexual abuse content or provide advice on how to groom children. That would be punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "And the Border Force will be given powers to instruct individuals who they suspect of posing a sexual risk to children to unlock their digital devices for inspection when they attempt to enter the UK, as CSAM is often filmed abroad. Depending on the severity of the images, this will be punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Artificially generated CSAM involves images that are either partly or completely computer generated. Software can \"nudify\" real images and replace the face of one child with another, creating a realistic image.",
      "In some cases, the real-life voices of children are also used, meaning innocent survivors of abuse are being re-victimised.",
      "Fake images are also being used to blackmail children and force victims into further abuse.",
      "The National Crime Agency (NCA) said that there are 800 arrests each month relating to threats posed to children online. It said 840,000 adults are a threat to children nationwide - both online and offline - which makes up 1.6% of the adult population.",
      "Cooper said: \"You have perpetrators who are using AI to help them better groom or blackmail teenagers and children, distorting images and using those to draw young people into further abuse, just the most horrific things taking place and also becoming more sadistic.\"",
      "She continued: \"This is an area where the technology doesn't stand still and our response cannot stand still to keep children safe.\"",
      "Some experts, however, believe the government could have gone further.",
      "Prof Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse, said the changes were \"welcome\" but that there were \"significant gaps\".",
      "The government should ban \"nudify\" apps and tackle the \"normalisation of sexual activity with young-looking girls on the mainstream porn sites\", she said, describing these videos as \"simulated child sexual abuse videos\".",
      "These videos \"involve adult actors but they look very young and are shown in children's bedrooms, with toys, pigtails, braces and other markers of childhood,\" she said. \"This material can be found with the most obvious search terms and legitimises and normalises child sexual abuse. Unlike in many other countries, this material remains lawful in the UK.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced, with them becoming more prevalent on the open web.",
      "The charity's latest data shows reports of AI-generated CSAM have risen 380% with 245 confirmed reports in 2024 compared with 51 in 2023. Each report can contain thousands of images.",
      "In research last year it found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%.",
      "Experts say AI CSAM can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake.",
      "The interim chief executive of the IWF, Derek Ray-Hill, said: \"The availability of this AI content further fuels sexual violence against children.",
      "\"It emboldens and encourages abusers, and it makes real children less safe. There is certainly more to be done to prevent AI technology from being exploited, but we welcome [the] announcement, and believe these measures are a vital starting point.\"",
      "Lynn Perry, chief executive of children's charity Barnardo's, welcomed government action to tackle AI-produced CSAM \"which normalises the abuse of children, putting more of them at risk, both on and offline\".",
      "\"It is vital that legislation keeps up with technological advances to prevent these horrific crimes,\" she added.",
      "\"Tech companies must make sure their platforms are safe for children. They need to take action to introduce stronger safeguards, and Ofcom must ensure that the Online Safety Act is implemented effectively and robustly.\"",

      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",

      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",

      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",

      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",

      "With seismic activity remaining intense in the region, scientists are on alert not only for Santorini, but also for Amorgos, Anafi and Ios.",
      "In the event of a larger earthquake, the main issue is the resistance of buildings, especially in Santorini, due to the peculiarities of the soil.",

      "Greek authorities have said that the recent tremors were related to tectonic plate movements instead of volcanic activity.",
      "Scientists cannot currently predict the exact timing, size or location of earthquakes.",
      "But there are areas of the world where they are more likely to occur which helps governments to prepare.",
      "Earthquakes occur as the result of tectonic plates moving either past, below each other or apart. This results in stress that is built up and then released as earthquakes along or near the boundaries of these plates \u2013 known as fault lines. Santorini and the Greek Islands are near such a line.",
      "As scientists cannot predict such events, the best way to prevent damage or loss of life is for authorities to reduce the vulnerability of their populations. This can be through designing and constructing earthquake-resistant buildings or evacuating residents when earthquakes begin.",

    "story": [
      "The Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Acsa) has apologised for failing to protect the public from the risk posed by a prolific British child abuser who had moved to South African in 2001.",
      "Senior barrister John Smyth, who died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77,  abused over 100 children and young men in the UK and Zimbabwe in the 1970s and 1980s. He met many of them at Christian camps that he organised.",
      "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, resigned last year following the publication of an independent review into the matter.",
      "It found that Mr Welby and other church leaders \"could and should\" have formally reported Smyth in 2013 to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa.",
      "Smyth moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984, two years after a report, which was not made public at the time, detailed the physical abuse he meted out.",
      "His 2001 move to South Africa came after an investigation into his activities in Zimbabwe, the findings of which were not widely circulated.",
      "A fresh enquiry commissioned last year by Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba found that while no similar cases of abuse were \"ascertainable on record\" in South Africa, \"there was a very high risk that they could have happened\".",
      "The independent report found that while the Church had no prior warnings of Smyth's abuses until 2013, its \"further communication of that warning within Acsa between 2013 and Smyth's death in 2018... fell short\".",

      "It says that Smyth joined an Anglican community in Durban, where he occasionally preached and was part of a team running confirmation classes that exposed him to young children.",
      "He and his wife Anne \"abruptly\" left that community at some point in 2003 or 2004 after the church's leaders confronted Smyth with information about his abusive behaviour, the report says.",
      "The couple then moved to Cape Town and joined another Anglican community.",
      "In August 2013, the \"first warning to Acsa\" on Smyth's behaviour was sent to Bishop Garth Counsell by the Diocese of Ely in the UK and by the end of the year, the couple left the Anglican Church for a different Christian community, Church-on-Main. They would later return to an Anglican church just shortly before Smyth's death.",
      "And while another bishop, Peter Lee, had also \"heard informally\" about the abuses prior to his arrival in South Africa in 1976, the report found that neither clergyman were \"remiss in any duty to pass on what had reached them regarding Smyth\".",
      "\"But... [they] erred in failing to inform the authorities at Church-on-Main of what they had learned about Smyth from the letter received from the Diocese of Ely.\"",
      "The report says that though there were no allegations of Smyth continuing his abusive behaviour in South Africa \"what... is evident... is that from 2001 on, young members of Acsa were exposed to the real risk of Smyth perpetrating in South Africa the serial abuse documented in the UK and Zimbabwe\".",
      "In a statement on Tuesday, Archbishop Makgoba acknowledged the Church's failure to protect its congregants and \"wider community\" from Smyth's potential abuse.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:20 GMT",
    "summary": "The African nation exports its cashews in raw form, but processing them would be more lucrative.",
    "story": [
      "The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused.",
      "I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p).",
      "That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up.",
      "The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer.",
      "\"It's incredible,\" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning.",
      "The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy.",
      "Cashing in on Ghana's cashews",
      "Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second.",
      "To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews.",
      "Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them.",
      "He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult.",
      "\"We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,\" he says. \"I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry.\"",
      "He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews.",
      "\"It's amazing,\" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. \"Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne.\"",
      "As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews.",
      "Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year.",
      "Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana.",
      "\"If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,\" she complains. \"As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies.\"",
      "She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam.",
      "Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs.",
      "It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself.",
      "Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders.",
      "Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer.",
      "More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms.",
      "But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies.",
      "\"In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,\" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. \"You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class\".",
      "Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses.",
      "Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews.",
      "\"These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. \"They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it].\"",
      "He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation.",
      "But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive.",
      "\"There's a massive brain drain,\" he says. \"My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation.\"",
      "He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West.",
      "Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate.",
      "\"I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast.",
      "\"There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods.\"",

      "Last week India further slashed import duties on motorcycles, cutting tariffs on heavyweight bikes with engines above 1,600cc from 50% to 30% and smaller ones from 50% to 40%.",
      "A pre-emptive move designed to further smoothen the entry of Harley Davidsons into India \u2013 and, Delhi hopes, ward off any threat of tariffs. US motorcycle exports to India were worth $3m last year.",
      "Donald Trump has marked his return to the White House by brandishing trade measures against America's neighbours and allies as well as its big rival China.",
      "India hopes it is ahead of the game \u2013 but will its tariff cuts satisfy Trump, or is trade action still on the table?",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are literally two arms of the US. If he has acted against them, he could easily act against India too,\" says Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Institute (GTRI).",
      "In their phone conversation late last month, the US president pressed Prime Minister Narendra Modi to buy more US arms and for there to be a fairer trade balance, keeping the pressure on.",
      "And during his first term, Trump fixated on India's steep tariffs. He repeatedly slammed the then 100% duty on Harleys as \"unacceptable\", making it a rallying point in his crusade against what he saw as unfair trade practices.",
      "In the past he repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.",
      "India enjoys a trade surplus with the US, its top trading partner. Bilateral trade crossed $190bn (\u00a3150bn) in 2023. Merchandise exports to US have surged 40% to $123bn since 2018, while services trade grew 22% to reach $66bn. Meanwhile, US exports to India stood at $70bn.",
      "But beyond bikes, India has zeroed out import taxes on satellite ground installations, benefiting US exporters who supplied $92m worth in 2023.",
      "Tariffs on synthetic flavouring essences dropped from 100% to 20% ($21m in US exports last year), while duties on fish hydrolysate for aquatic feed fell from 15% to 5% ($35m in US exports in 2024). India also scrapped tariffs on select waste and scrap items, a category where US exports amounted to $2.5bn last year.",
      "Top US exports to India in 2023 included crude oil and petroleum products ($14bn), LNG, coal, medical devices, scientific instruments, scrap metals, turbojets, computers and almonds.",
      "\"While Trump has criticised India's tariff policies, the latest reductions signal a policy shift that could enhance US exports across various sectors,\" says Mr Srivastava.",
      "\"With key tariff cuts on technology, automobiles, industrial and waste imports, India appears to be taking steps towards facilitating trade even as the global trade environment remains tense.\"",
      "Meanwhile India's exports span a diverse range \u2013 from textiles, pharmaceuticals and engineering goods to petroleum oils, machinery and cut diamonds. It also ships smartphones, auto parts, shrimp, gold jewellery, footwear and iron and steel, making it a key player in global trade.",
      "\"This diverse range of products reflects India's broad export base and its strong trade relationship with the US,\" says Mr Srivastava.",
      "India was once among the world's most protectionist economies. In the 1970s, American political scientist Joseph Grieco described it as having one of the \"most restrictive, cumbersome\u2026 regimes regulating foreign direct investments\".",
      "This inward-looking approach led to a steady decline in India's export share of global trade, from 2.42% in 1948 to just 0.51% by 1991. As Aseema Sinha, author of Globalizing India: How Global Rules and Markets are Shaping India's Rise to Power, observed, this period was marked by \"a self-driven industrialisation drive, export pessimism, and suspicion of global alliances\".",
      "India finally opened up in the 1990s and 2000s, cutting average tariffs from 80% in 1990 to 13% in 2008.",
      "But after Modi launched his \"Make in India\" policy to boost manufacturing in India tariffs have climbed again to about 18% - higher than those set by other Asian nations such as China, South Korea, Indonesia and Thailand.",
      "Trade expert Biswajit Dhar believes India is now a prime target under Trump's \"America First\" policy, which seeks reciprocal action against high import taxes and reassesses trade with large US deficits.",
      "Agricultural market access remains a sticking point for the US, he says.",
      "India dropped retaliatory tariffs on US-made almonds, apples, chickpeas, lentils and walnuts in 2023, but Trump will likely demand more. However, India may hold firm given domestic political sensitivity around farming.",
      "\"This is where we will drive a hard bargain, and problems could arise,\" cautions Mr Dhar.",
      "That said, India's strategic ties with the US \u2013 as a Quad member countering China \u2013 could help ease friction. India's willingness to accept the deportation of undocumented Indian migrants in the US without pushing back has also sent a positive signal, Mr Dhar notes.",
      "Experts also point to Modi's warm personal rapport with Trump as an advantage. Some clarity will come when the Indian prime minister visits the White House \u2013 this month, according to some reports \u2013 at Trump's invitation."

      "But the lawyer warned that \"citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised\".",
      "He stressed, though, that he had \"never heard\" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US.",
      "Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had \"never heard of such a suggestion\" as sending American citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas.",
      "While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that \"you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen\".",
      "The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens.",
      "They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault.",
      "Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud.",
      "Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be deported.",

      "Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadoran jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland.",
      "\"I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,\" he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",

      "\"Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal - MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be - he has offered his jails,\" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele.",
      "While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will be sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his \"unprecedented offer of friendship\", Bukele has landed firmly in Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.",

    "summary": "China has set out a series of measures to kick in next week after the US introduced 10% tariffs on imports from the country.",
    "story": [
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated after China hit back against the introduction of tariffs by the US with measures of its own.",
      "Beijing has set out to target specific American goods with retaliatory taxes, among other measures, following the blanket 10% tariff introduced by President Donald Trump on all Chinese imports to the US.",
      "In some ways, this latest tit-for-tat is nothing new and builds on the long-running trade dispute between the nations, with tariffs having already been imposed and threatened on various goods since 2018.",
      "Trump has said he plans to speak to Chinese President Xi Jinping, so a deal could yet be struck. But if China proceeds with its response on 10 February as planned, what could the impact be?",
      "Coal, oil and gas",
      "Part of China's countermeasures to Trump's tariffs is to announce import taxes of its own on US coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) of 10%, and a 15% charge on crude oil.",
      "The response from Beijing means companies wanting to import fossil fuels from the US would have to pay the tax in order to do so.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of coal, but it gets most of it from Indonesia, although Russia, Australia and Mongolia are also among its suppliers.",
      "When it comes to the US, China has been increasing imports of LNG from the country, with volumes nearly double 2018 levels, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "But its overall fossil fuel trade is modest, with US imports accounting for just 1.7% of China's total crude oil bought from abroad in 2023. This suggests China is not dependent on the US and so the impact of the tariffs on its economy could be minimal.",
      "Rebecca Harding, a trade economist and chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security think tank, said China could easily source more supplies from Russia, where it has already been buying oil on the cheap as the Kremlin seeks to fund its war effort.",
      "On the flipside, the US is the world's largest LNG exporter, and so has plenty of other customers, particularly the UK and the European Union.",

      "Trump sows uncertainty - and Xi Jinping sees an opportunity",
      "Agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks and big cars",
      "As well as fuel, China has slapped a 10% tariff on agricultural machinery, pick-up trucks, and some large cars.",
      "But China is not a big importer of US pick-ups and it gets most of its cars from Europe and Japan, so a 10% tariff on an already small number of imports would not hit consumers too hard.",
      "In recent years, China has increased investments in farm machinery to enhance production and reduce reliance on imports, and to strengthen its food security.",
      "So the introduction of tariffs on agricultural machinery might be another move to try to boost domestic industry.",
      "Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at consultancy Capital Economics, said all the tariff measures were \"fairly modest, at least relative to US moves\".",
      "He suggests that China's targeted goods represent about $20bn (\u00a316bn) worth of annual imports - around 12% of China's total imports from the US.",
      "\"This is a far cry from the more than $450bn worth of Chinese goods being targeted by the US.\"",
      "But he said China had \"clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the US [and domestic audiences] without inflicting too much damage\".",
      "Google probe",
      "The Chinese authorities have also announced some non-tariff measures, one of which is an anti-monopoly investigation into US tech giant Google.",
      "It is unclear what the investigation will involve, but for context, Google's search services have been blocked in China since 2010.",
      "The company still has some business presence in the country through providing apps and games to the Chinese markets by working with local developers.",
      "But China only generates about 1% of Google's global sales, which suggests if it cut ties entirely with the country, it wouldn't be much worse off.",
      "Calvin Klein added to 'unreliable entities' list",
      "China has added PVH, the American company that owns designer brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, to its so-called \"unreliable entity\" list and accused them of \"discriminatory measures against Chinese enterprises\".",
      "The list, which has other US firms on it, was created in 2020 by Beijing amid the heating up of trade tensions.",
      "For Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, being on China's list will make it harder to do business in the country. They may face sanctions, including fines, and having the work visas of their foreign employees revoked.",
      "Regulators will also go to factories of the firms to investigate operations, according to Andreas Schotter, professor of international business at Western University in Ontario, Canada.",
      "The US has its own \"entity list\", which bars certain organisations from buying products from US companies without approval from Washington.",
      "\"China is hitting back in the same way President Trump is accusing Chinese companies. This is all part of the US driven de-coupling of the US and China,\" Prof Schotter added.",

      "China probes Calvin Klein over Xinjiang cotton",
      "Export controls on rare metals",
      "While tariffs have been placed on the companies wanting to import goods from abroad, China has also imposed export controls on 25 rare metals.",
      "Some of the metals are key components for many electrical products and military equipment.",
      "China has mastered the ability to refine such metals, and produced almost 90% of global refined output.",
      "The restricted list includes tungsten, which is difficult to source and a crucial material for the aerospace industry.",
      "While there are restrictions on exports, Mr Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics, said it was notable that the critical metals China imports from the US, which are used to make high-end chips, semiconductor machinery, pharmaceuticals and aerospace equipment were not targeted in any measures.",
      "The experience of previous rounds of restrictions suggests exports will drop sharply as companies scramble to get licences, a process that takes several weeks.",
      "When it comes to the impact of the restrictions, it appears the US has a plan. On Monday, Trump said he wanted Ukraine to guarantee the supply of more rare earth metals in exchange for $300bn of support in its fight against Russia."

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 19:06:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The president will soon have to decide whether to match his trade rhetoric with action or shelve his tariff plans.",
    "story": [
      "For the first week of Donald Trump's presidency, tariffs - a favourite talking point during last year's presidential campaign - were the dogs that didn't bark.",
      "Trade seemed to take a back seat while the new administration pressed ahead on immigration enforcement, pardons of Capitol riot convictions, a fossil-fuel energy policy and federal workforce upheaval - among a range of other disruptive new measures.",
      "That all changed this past weekend when Trump announced sweeping 25% tariffs on US allies Canada and Mexico, along with 10% duties on Chinese imports.",
      "And while he has since delayed imposing those tariffs on his North American neighbours for a month after both countries agreed new border measures, the president still faces a moment of reckoning in which he will ultimately have to decide whether to match his rhetoric with action.",
      "Trump often talks of the trade deficits between the US and its two neighbours as a key source of his dissatisfaction. If that's the case, then no amount of new border security or drug seizures - whatever the metrics or specific demands - will make the president fully abandon his tariff threats.",
      "Trump has also said he views tariffs not just as a tool to achieve policy objectives, but as a permanent source of US revenue and a means to fund government programmes and reduce the budget deficit. And if that is his ultimate objective, then tariffs on America's largest trading partners may be the only effective answer.",
      "Global financial markets reeled at this prospect on Monday, as the US appeared on the brink of waging a multi-front trade war with some of its closest economic partners.",
      "Then, after conversations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump put the tariffs on pause. While the new duties on China have gone into effect - and have prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing - markets have viewed those US moves as less disruptive and smaller in scope.",
      "By contrast, if US had engaged in an escalating series of tariffs with Canada and Mexico, which accounted for more than $1.57tn (\u00a31.24tn) in goods in 2023, the global economic effect could have been catastrophic.",
      "That possibly dire development has been averted, for now, with Trump and his administration declaring at least a partial victory.",
      "The details of what Canada and Mexico conceded, however, paint a more complicated picture.",
      "While Canada agreed to form a joint anti-crime strike force with the US and appoint a \"fentanyl tsar\", the concrete steps it detailed were all part of a border-security package Canada had previously announced.",
      "Mexico pledged stepped up drug enforcement and 10,000 troops to patrol the US-Mexico border - but those numbers mirror the deployments the nation made in 2019 and again in 2021",
      "In a month's time, Trump will again have to decide if Canada and Mexico are doing enough to satisfy his demands - or whether the delayed tariffs will go into effect.",

      "By the administration's own measures, US immigration officials only seized 43lbs (19.5kg) of fentanyl and caught 193,540 people crossing at the US-Canada border in 2024. The numbers are much higher for the US-Mexico border, but undocumented crossings - and drug seizures- are down there, as well.",
      "Global financial markets have calmed considerably since Monday morning's tariff-inspired disruption. Investors, it seems, have concluded that on trade Trump is more bluster than action.",
      "The president may be able to extract more concessions from Canadian and Mexican leaders in a month's time, but they may also conclude at some point that Trump doesn't have the will to follow through on his threats.",
      "Despite claims of success, his sabre-rattling on trade could ultimately produce diminishing returns.",
      "At that point, the president would have a decision to make. Does he shelve his most sweeping tariff plans for good? Were his dreams of returning the US to late-19th century trade policy - which he has said was a golden age of American economic power - unrealistic?",
      "Or does he press ahead with his vision of a new, more America-focused global trade order despite the risk of at least short-term economic pain?",

    "story": [
      "Beijing has made its decision. After days of warning of counter measures and urging Washington to enter negotiations and \"meet China halfway\", it has decided to hit back \u2013 or at least threaten to retaliate with its own tariffs.",
      "China said it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the US from 10 February.",
      "The date is important. It means there is still time for the world's two largest economies to step back from the brink of a trade war.",

      "Five ways China is hitting back against US tariffs",
      "Firstly, China's counter measures are limited in scope compared to Donald Trump's levy of 10% on all Chinese goods heading to the US.",
      "America is the biggest exporter of liquid natural gas across the world, but China accounts for only around 2.3% of those exports and its major car imports are from Europe and Japan.",
      "This calculated and selective targeting of goods may just be an opening shot by Beijing, a way of gaining some bargaining power and leverage ahead of any talks.",
      "Officials in China may be encouraged by the cordial start to the US-China relationship since Trump took office.",
      "The US president said he had a \"very good\" phone call with President Xi days before his inaugural ceremony, which was attended by the highest-level Chinese official ever to be dispatched to such an event. He has also suggested that he hopes to work with Xi on resolving Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "President Xi might not want to pick a fight with Trump just yet as he is busy trying to shore up his own ailing economy.",
      "This is also familiar territory for both leaders \u2013 although they might not be keen to relive the past. There was a honeymoon period in US-China relations during Trump's last term, before the relationship soured.",
      "To deal or not to deal",
      "It will also be far more difficult for Trump to do a deal with China than with Mexico and Canada  - and much will depend on what he wants from Beijing.",
      "China is Washington's chief economic rival and cutting the country off from major supply chains has been a goal of the Trump administration.",
      "If Trump asks for too much, Xi might feel he can walk away and there will be limits on just how far he is willing to be pushed.",
      "The US president is dealing with a far more confident China than he did back then. Beijing has expanded its global footprint, and it is now the lead trade partner for more than 120 countries.",
      "Over the past two decades, it has also steadily tried to reduce the importance of trade to its economy and ramped up domestic production. Today, imports and exports account for around 37% of China's GDP, compared with more than 60% in the early 2000s, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "The 10% tariff will sting, but Beijing may feel it can absorb the blow \u2013 for now.",
      "The fear will be that President Trump is serious about ramping up that percentage to the 60% he pledged during his campaign or that he will continue to use the threat of tariffs as a recurring diplomatic tool to hold over Xi's head.",
      "If that happens, Beijing will want to be ready and that means having a clear strategy in case this escalates.",
      "Learning from the past",
      "The last time the leaders signed a deal it did not end well.",
      "The two countries issued tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of goods from 2018.",
      "It lasted more than two years until eventually China agreed to spend an extra $200bn (\u00a3161bn) a year on US goods in 2020.",
      "Washington hoped the deal would bring down the huge trade deficit between China and the US, but the plan was derailed by the Covid pandemic and that deficit now sits at $361bn, according to Chinese customs data.",
      "There are also key challenges for China as it is thinking several steps ahead in any negotiation.",
      "Beijing still sells nearly four times more goods to the United States than it buys - and during Trump's first term in office, it ran out of items to target.",
      "Analysts believe that China is now looking at a wider range of measures than just tariffs to retaliate if the trade war ramps up.",

      "Twenty-four hours later, we're in a rather different place with the tariffs - or taxes - against America's closest neighbours and trading partners on hold for 30 days.",
      "But the 10% tariffs on all goods imports from China have gone ahead, and Beijing has responded in kind. So what are the potential economic consequences of these opening salvos and could this turn into a broader trade war?",
      "Trump's 10% tariff on China begins as Beijing plans retaliation on US energy and some cars",
      "Trump's trade war with neighbours is delayed - what did they all get out of it?",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "China is subject to significant US tariffs already and has been since Trump's first term. But the blanket nature of today's new levies from the White House on every single goods import from China - from toys, to mobile phones, to clothes - is new and significant.",
      "Beijing's promised tariff retaliation - including new levies on imports from the US of oil, agricultural machinery and some cars - is far less sweeping. Yet the retaliation moves us into the arena of tit-for-tat action, where the country experiencing the tariffs feels it has no choice but to hit back to show its own citizens it can't be pushed around by a foreign power.",
      "This is the dictionary definition of a trade war - and economic historians warn they tend to generate their own momentum and can rapidly spiral out of control.",
      "Trump has used just about every justification under the sun for tariffs, from raising more tax revenue to boosting American manufacturing and rebalancing trade. But one thing recent days confirm is the new president regards them as a powerful way to compel other nations to do what he wants.",
      "He threatened massive and punitive tariffs on Colombia when it initially refused to accept US flights of its deported nationals, but he lifted the threat when Bogota acquiesced.",
      "The White House might also point to the response of Mexico and Canada yesterday as evidence tariff threats yield results. He had threatened to ride roughshod over his own North American free trade deal unless those nations tightened up on border control. Although how much extra those two countries actually promised yesterday on border security relative to what they were already doing is open to question.",
      "Yet the problem with the White House using tariff threats in this way is that if other countries don't back down - or agreements are not reached - Trump might well feel he has no choice but to follow through or risk losing all credibility. And the targeted country might feel it has to respond with its prepared countermeasures, even if they would prefer not to.",
      "That high-risk dynamic - where things could slip out of control in an atmosphere of distrust and political pressure - is why many analysts and economists are far from comforted by how things have played out with Mexico and Canada this week.",
      "The other reason many economists fear Trump's intimidatory tariff diplomacy is its potentially chilling impact on business investment and confidence. US car firms have a deeply integrated industrial base across America, Mexico and Canada. Automotive parts cross those borders multiple times in the vehicle assembly process.",
      "The levying of 25% tariffs on each of those movements would be disastrous for these businesses. Those North American tariffs have been paused for now, but it's very hard to see US or Canadian automotive executives committing to further investment in those cross-border supply chains any time soon - and perhaps for many years to come.",
      "That will have negative implications for their productivity - and also for the wages of their employees in all three countries. The view of many economists is having cross-border supply chains makes these firms more productive than they would otherwise be and this raises US workers' wages relative to where they would be if they only manufactured in America.",
      "These same effects apply on a global scale. In light of Trump's tariff threats against the European Union, how many US firms are likely to be going ahead with planned investments in Europe - and vice versa?",
      "Countries such as Vietnam and Malaysia benefitted indirectly from the US tariffs imposed on China in Donald Trump's first presidential term, as multinationals shifted manufacturing out of China and into their territories to avoid the taxes and to continue exporting to America. But what if Trump now threatens tariffs against them too?",
      "The huge uncertainty Trump's tariff threats have injected into the global economy - even if they don't always translate into actual new taxes - will likely already be doing damage.",

      "The Sims was never supposed to be a hit.",
      "Back in the 1990s, when creator Will Wright pitched the game to his bosses, they weren't convinced by his idea of a \"virtual dollhouse\".",
      "A so-called life simulator where players design their own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs.",
      "Who wants that?",
      "Quite a lot of people, it turns out.",
      "Now, 25 years from its debut, The Sims is one of the best-selling video game series of all time, with an active community of superfans known as Simmers.",
      "The latest instalment, The Sims 4, has been translated into 18 languages and played by 85 million people worldwide, according to publisher Electronic Arts.",
      "The original game's open-ended nature helped it to become a hit and reach so-called \"casual gamers\" outside the medium's more dedicated audience.",
      "Players had the freedom to carefully craft a detailed domestic setting for their digital people, managing their love lives, daily routines, basic needs and hobbies in exacting detail.",
      "But it also allowed them to imagine various torments for their virtual pals. One of the most famous - stranding your Sim in a swimming pool without a ladder - remains a popular meme to this day.",
      "UK-based streamer Jesse, best known as Plumbella, says she became obsessed with the legendary trick when she first played the game at five years old.",
      "The Sims has been part of Jesse\u2019s life ever since, thanks, she says, to the community around it.",
      "Players can create modifications or \"mods\" that alter different elements from the way the game plays to a character's appearance.",
      "Extra height options, having multiple jobs and neurodivergent personality traits are among some of the popular fan-made add-ons.",
      "For dedicated fans, Jesse says, the longevity comes from building on each other's creations.",
      "As she puts it: \"Take something and customise it and share it with other Simmers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see the ways that people can come up with to use their game in an interesting way.\"",
      "The ability to express yourself in The Sims also made it a popular title among its many players from diverse communities.",
      "Even at its launch in 2000, The Sims included same-sex relationships at a time when choices around sexuality or identity in gaming were rare.",
      "Creator Mollie, who streams as TheEnglishSimmer, makes a lot of LGBT-themed content for her channel.",
      "She says developer Maxis has \"always been kind of a spearhead in the gaming industry when it comes to telling diverse stories and wanting to show that representation\".",
      "Mollie says The Sims has given her a platform to find others like her.",

      "\"But the difference between The Sims and other games is I can do something about it.\"",
      "Amira's Melanin Pack was a hit when it was released, and she's since worked with Maxis and Electronic Arts on officially adopting more skin tones into the game.",
      "\"For me that's a big part of why I've played the game for so long,\" she says.",
      "\"I can do what I want, I can make a Sim with any body type, complexion, hair, whatever I want to do, it's one of the most customisable games I have.\"",
      "Amira says she's noticed more and more games offering the ability to choose different skin tones, body types and hairstyles without the need for third-party add-ons.",

      "Zoe Delahunty-Light, a video producer at website Eurogamer, commends The Sims for making \"great strides\" with diversity and working with creators to build authentic representation into the game.",
      "But she does point out that much of the work was done first, for free, by modders.",
      "The official Lovestruck add-on, Zoe says, introduces polyamorous relationships to the game and costs \u00a330 ($37).",
      "\"So it can feel like it is squeezing as much money as it can out of people who desire representation the most, which is pretty audacious,\" she says.",
      "The game has also been criticised over a lack of inclusion for players with disabilities, both in their ability to modify its controls and see themselves on screen.",
      "\"The game still lacks the option to change key binds, which is a basic accessibility issue,\" says Zoe.",
      "Developer Maxis has previously said it's discussing the introduction of more accessibility features to the game.",

      "The tech industry has followed suit, with companies such as Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, scrapping its DEI efforts and also cutting moderation teams.",
      "There's a question over whether this could impact gaming, where companies are often criticised for failing to adequately tackle racial and gender-based harassment on their platforms.",

      "Both the film, and Madison's performance in particular, have been gaining huge amounts of awards momentum. It started when the movie premiered at Cannes.",
      "\"I have been working for almost a decade now, well trying to work. And that was my ultimate dream, to go to Cannes. And we had a film in the main competition, and then we won [the top prize, the Palme D'Or] and that was crazy in itself.\"",

      "\"She's so unique. Not only in her physicality, but there's something about her aura,\" says Baker. \"There's something.. she's actually quite subdued, even in real life. Her demeanour is, she's quite reserved.",
      "\"But then suddenly she can explode like no other other person I've ever seen, no other actor I've ever seen.",
      "\"And I was always looking forward to those moments shooting the film, knowing that a scene would call for that. You know, to see that you don't detect anything, and then suddenly just total eruption. It was incredible to watch.\"",
      "The contradictions in Ani, and the shifting genres of the movie were elements that Madison says she embraced strongly during the filming.",
      "\"As an actor sometimes I felt like I was shooting a very romantic film, and sometimes it was almost like a horror film, or a drama, or a slapstick comedy. To navigate through my character with all of these different genres was fun. It was a challenge, and I liked it!\"",

    "summary": "GBS is a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing paralysis.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, a school teacher in the western Indian city of Pune found her six-year-old son upset about homework.",
      "\"I had erased some words and asked him to write them. I assumed he was angry and that's why he was not holding the pencil properly,\" she told the Indian Express newspaper.",
      "She never imagined his struggle to hold a pencil was the first sign of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and paralysis.",
      "Within days, the boy was in intensive care, unable to move his arms or legs. As his condition worsened, he lost the ability to swallow, speak, and eventually breathe, requiring ventilator support. He is now recovering.",
      "The boy is among around 160 reported cases of GBS since early January in Pune, an education and IT hub, ringed by industrial towns and villages. There have been five suspected deaths. Currently, 48 patients are in intensive  care, 21 on ventilator, and 38 have been discharged, according to official figures.",
      "GBS begins with tingling or numbness in the feet and hands, followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving joints. Symptoms worsen over two to four weeks, typically starting in the arms and legs. The reported mortality rate varies between three and 13%, depending on severity and quality of health care support.",
      "The outbreak in Pune is being traced to a pathogen called campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of foodborne infections, and the biggest driver of GBS worldwide. The link between the two was discovered in the 1990s in rural China, where the pathogen was common in chickens, and GBS outbreaks occurred every monsoon as children played in water contaminated by chicken or duck droppings.",
      "GBS is not entirely uncommon in India. Monojit Debnath and Madhu Nagappa, of  Bangalore-based  National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), studied 150 GBS patients over a five year period between 2014 and 2019.",
      "Their findings showed 79% of the patients had evidence of prior infections, with a third testing positive for campylobacter. Notably, co-infections were more common, occurring in 65%, suggesting a complex interplay of bacteria and viruses.",
      "More recently, outbreaks linked to the pathogen have been reported from all over the world. In the first seven months of 2023, Peru reported over 200 suspected cases and at least four deaths of GBS, prompting the government to declare a national health emergency and strengthen public health measures. Two-thirds of the cases were linked to campylobacter.",
      "In countries with good hygiene, fewer GBS cases are linked to campylobacter, with respiratory infections being a major contributor, say experts. There have been other triggers as well. In 2015 Brazil reported a cluster of GBS cases linked to the Zika virus. Vaccines can rarely trigger GBS, but one Covid vaccine was reportedly linked to a few hundred GBS cases in the UK in 2021.",
      "\"Campylobacter is endemic with hundreds of thousands of cases taking place all the time. It is always existing in the environment,\" Hugh Willison, a professor of neurology at University of Glasgow told me.",
      "Yet, it is not easy to develop GBS, scientists say.",
      "There's a specific strain of campylobacter, which has a sugar-coated outer layer, and in rare cases, its molecular structure matches the coating of human nerve cells.",
      "When the patient's immune system attacks the bacteria, it may end up targeting the nerves as well \u2013 a process called molecular mimicry \u2013 leading to GBS. However, a small fraction of campylobacter strains have this nerve-like coat.",
      "\"In Pune, a strain of campylobacter with this molecular feature is likely to be circulating, and a surge in infections with this strain consequently leads to a higher number of GBS cases,\" says Prof Willison.",
      "Most experts estimate that about one in 100 campylobacter strains carry the GBS risk, and one in 100 people infected with such a strain develop GBS, making the overall risk roughly one in 10,000.",
      "That creates what Prof Willison describes as an \"immunological Russian roulette\", triggering an \"acute neurological tsunami\" that surges through the peripheral nervous system. Once the immune response subsides, the attack wanes \u2013 but the body still needs time, medical care, and support to repair the damage.",
      "What makes things worse is that there is no cure for GBS.",
      "In GBS, the body produces antibodies against campylobacter, which then attack the nerves. Physicians use \"plasma exchange\", a process that filters blood to remove the harmful antibodies, along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a therapeutic antibody derived from normal blood, to help reduce the severity of the disease.",
      "The other challenge is that there is no single test to diagnose GBS. The diagnosis, say physicians, is mainly based on clinical features. It presents itself as a form of paralysis which can be also caused by polio, viruses or rare neurological disease.",
      "\"The diagnosis is a constellation of clinical features. Misdiagnosis or no diagnosis or late diagnosis can happen easily,\" says Prof Willison.",
      "India's uneven public health system presents a challenge, as doctors in rural areas may struggle to diagnose GBS. One reason, possibly, why the World Health Organization (WHO) teams are in Pune, is collaborating with federal and state health workers to trace, test, and monitor cases, and analysing trends to support effective treatment.",
      "Authorities say they have surveilled more than 60,000 houses, picked up 160 water samples for tests, and asked people to drink boiled water and eat fresh and clean food, and not have \"stale food and partially cooked chicken or mutton\".",
      "While most cases of GBS around the world come from undercooked poultry, it can also spread through water, similar to cholera or salmonella, experts say.",
      "Contaminated water used for washing or preparing street food makes it easy for the bacteria to spread. Clearly, in Pune, a campylobacter strain with the distinctive molecular feature is circulating, affecting a large number of people.",
      "What is not clear is whether this has been due to large scale contamination of water supply or a lot of people consuming infected poultry. \"We appeal to people not to panic,\" says a health department advisory. But in the face of uncertainty, it is easier said than done.",

Many companies are either teasing their spots or releasing their ads early, aiming to generate buzz before the big game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs.",

      "Beyond the investment on securing Super Bowl air time, advertisers spend additional millions on creating their commercials, adding to the pressure for their investments to pay off. For a company whose Super Bowl ad scores a touchdown, the benefits can include a sales boost by attracting new customers as well as creating stronger brand loyalty.",
      "This year's mix of ad categories for the most part includes the usual suspects: beverages, snacks, tech companies and telcos, according to Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports.

      "She was the archetypal Sixties rock chick; a pop star at 17; Mick Jagger's muse at 19; and by 24, a junkie on the streets. But Marianne Faithfull (Dec. 29, 1946-Jan. 30, 2025), who burst out of the '60s British Invasion with the hit \"As Tears Go By,\" launched a second act in the late 1970s. Her lithe voice, later weathered from surviving sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll, was brought forth in such albums as \"Broken English,\" \"Dangerous Acquaintances,\" and \"Easy Come, Easy Go.\"",
      "The daughter of an eccentric British professor and an Austrian baroness, Faithfull was just out of convent school, and was performing as a folk singer, when she was discovered at a party by the manager of the Rolling Stones. Jagger and Keith Richards wrote her breakthrough hit, \"As Tears Go By.\"",
      "Just as her career exploded, at 18, she married a London art dealer and had a baby. \"I was very overenthusiastically eager for life,\" she told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2009. \"I wanted to just bite into it and swallow it whole.\"",
      "She then left her marriage for Jagger. They became one of Swinging London's most photographed couples. Then, in February 1967, British police barged into a Rolling Stones party at Richards' home. The police found drugs, and Marianne naked in a fur rug. Though charges were later dropped, Faithfull's image was disgraced. She felt she'd let her parents down: \"I think that's the worst feeling in the world,\" she told Anthony Mason.",
      "She played up the \"bad girl\" image by acting in the film \"Girl on a Motorcycle.\" But she miscarried Jagger's child after eight months, and while on a trip to Australia with Jagger, she swallowed 150 sleeping pills. She spent six days in a coma. Faithfull recovered, but her relationship with Jagger did not.",
      "She fell into heroin addiction. She said, \"It's certainly not what I was dreaming of when I was eight or ten \u2013 I'm going to grow up and become a junkie and live on the street!\" she said. She would lose custody of her son, Nicholas, and the damage began to show in her singing voice. But in 1979, she pulled herself together to release a raw and daring comeback album, \"Broken English.\" \"I became myself,\" she said, \"and it was not a person people thought I was. It was more intelligent, stronger, ravaged in its own way, but very quite interesting.\"",
      "It would be several more years before she freed herself of addiction, and in 2008 recorded \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" with Sean Lennon, Rufus Wainwright, Nick Cave, Cat Power, and Keith Richards. She also returned to acting, in \"Paris, Je T'aime,\" \"Marie Antoinette,\" and \"Faces in the Crowd.\"",
      "Faithfull said she appreciated the long, hard road she'd traveled: \"I think I've been very unconscious for a long time, and only now have I begun to get it. As long as I got it before I croaked, I think that's the main thing.\""

    "summary": "The actor-writer-director's latest film, a poignant comic-drama costarring Kieran Culkin, earned him an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. But Jesse Eisenberg finds it difficult to not feel miserable.",
    "story": [
      "We'll tell you up front: Actor-director Jesse Eisenberg, who says he can appreciate a good Jewish deli, is a different kind of movie star. We joined him last week at the legendary Canter's Deli in Los Angeles, and shared some chocolate babka, with a dill pickle chaser. \"This is the real test,\" Eisenberg said.",
      "It was a little unusual, but for Eisenberg, it'd already been a pretty unusual day. Just a few hours earlier, he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best original screenplay.",
      "And he was mortified.",
      "I asked, \"Are you able to enjoy moments like this?\"",
      "\"No, I'm not really wired to enjoy praise,\" he replied. \"I don't know why. I think it just, like, I don't know, triggers some guilt response in my brain and I try to find something to be miserable about. But I'll tell you what I do love: I love actually doing my job. Like, I feel so lucky that I found something I like to do.\"",
      "At the moment, his job is to promote the film he wrote, directed and starred in, \"A Real Pain,\" co-starring Kieran Culkin. The film is about two cousins who travel to Poland to see their ancestral home, and visit the actual home of their late grandmother, who barely survived the Holocaust.",
      "The film started out as a buddy movie about a trip to Mongolia. As he was writing the script, Eisenberg got stuck, until inspiration literally popped up on his computer. \"I was, like, 30 pages into the script and something was missing,\" he said. \"I knew the script was not going well. And so, I'm, like, kind of, like, banging my head against the keyboard. And an ad pops up online for 'Auschwitz tours.' And then in parentheses, 'with lunch.' And I was like, 'Auschwitz tours (with lunch)?' That's, like, the strangest pairing of four words I've ever seen. And once I saw that, and once I read that brochure, I was like, 'Oh, that's the movie. That is so interesting,' because I was trying to deal with these two characters who are both kind of, like, in pain in their own ways.\"",
      "\"Dude, we are Jews on a train in Poland, ******* think about it. \u2026 Does no one else see the irony here? Like, eating fancy food and sitting up here, when 80 years ago we would've been herded into the backs of these ******* things like cattle?\"",
      "Watch a scene with Jesse Eisenberg and Kieran Culkin in \"A Real Pain\" [Warning: Graphic language]",
      "Eisenberg has had those same thoughts. He is himself of Polish lineage, and he has relatives who were victims of the Holocaust. \"I come from a family who survived the war; a lot of, you know, cousins, aunts, and uncles who didn't,\" he said. \"And yet, I walk around New York City, like, kind of miserable. Like, I'm not, like, a happy person. I'm not asking for pity or anything; I'm just recognizing objectively, like, I'm not a happy person. And yet, I come from people who survived through miracles. Intellectually, I think I should be waking up every morning kissing the dirt that I'm here by virtue of a thousand miracles. And instead, I walk around, I'm like, Oh my God. What am I gonna do today? Oh my God. I shouldn't drink a coffee 'cause then I'll peak at noon.",
      "\"And so, I'm constantly trying to reconcile my fortunate life with how I feel about things, and my forebears' very unfortunate lives and how they appreciated things. And that's what this movie is kind of focusing on.\"",
      "It seems he's been feeling that same kind of anxiety all of his life. Raised in New Jersey, Jesse Eisenberg was, by his own admission, a \"sad kid\" who was uncomfortable at school, and took refuge in acting. By 2010 he'd made a name for himself in Hollywood, with roles like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in \"The Social Network.\" The part earned him an Oscar nod, and the juice to branch out into writing and directing.",
      "But when COVID shut down the film industry in 2020, Eisenberg and his wife, Anna Strout, moved back to her native Indiana, and spent their days volunteering at her mom's domestic violence shelter in Bloomington. \"I was just volunteering every day at the shelter,\" he said. \"It sounds weird to say this, and I don't mean this for any kind of \u2013 it was, like, the happiest time of my life. I was painting walls and fixing garbage disposals. And I just loved it so much. I loved being able to, like, accomplish something where there was no, like, critique of it, you know what I mean?\"",
      "\"It makes total sense,\" I said. \"You fix the garbage disposal, the garbage disposal's fixed. End of it.\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "But of all the roles he's played, on-screen and off-, he says the confident illusionist in the \"Now You See Me\" franchise is the most challenging, because it's absolutely nothing like him. \"We just did the third 'Now You See Me,' and it's such a blast,\" he said. \"And it's such a challenge, because I'm doing something that's, like, the exact opposite of my psychology. It's the only time I ever walk away thinking, 'I did a good job today.' But that's because my character thinks that they're doing well. And yes, they're Hollywood movies, and they're really fun. But, like, for me, it's been a kind of like a therapy.\"",
      "\"Does that confidence linger at all past the shoots?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, normally it will linger through dinner,\" he replied. \"Once I get on set and I'm in those clothes, and I'm speaking in the way they've written for me \u2026 I stand up straighter. I'm, like, an inch taller. It's amazing. I can make eye contact with my father!\"",
      "You'd think the success of \"A Real Pain\" would give Eisenberg some swagger. His movie also snagged Culkin an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor. But like the babka and pickles at Canter's, Eisenberg can't seem to enjoy the sweet without just a little bit of sour.",
      "I asked, \"Is there a part of you that finds this whole experience, with the way that 'A Real Pain' has been received, kind of unreal? That at some moment you're gonna wake up?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, I assume a piano is gonna fall on my head every day,\" Eisenberg said. \"Because I feel like, I am so lucky. And, like, the way my mind does equations is that this lucky thing must mean this horrible upcoming thing. And so, yes, I'm not walking under any air conditioners in New York City. I don't know how to think about it any other way. And that's really unfortunate, but true!\"",

    "story": [
      "Like many homes, Suzanne de Passe's is filled with stuff. Her version of stuff? Gold and platinum albums. Snapshots with Stevie Wonder and a young Michael Jackson. The Oscar-nominated screenplay she co-wrote for \"Lady Sings the Blues.\" Her 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Award.",
      "De Passe is a giant in the music and entertainment industry \u2026 a trailblazing executive who moved Motown from Hitsville to Hollywood. She did it with raw talent and relentless determination.",
      "\"I had so many wonderful things to do,\" she said, \"and they were all hard, and they were all new \u2013 learning; making mistakes; getting my butt kicked; crying (tears of frustration, not sadness) \u2013 and little by little, I got my legs up under me.\"",
      "Born in Harlem and nurtured in the historic Black community of Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, de Passe says a supportive family gave her the tools to succeed.",
      "I asked, \"What were the lessons you learned from them?\"",
      "\"I think more than lessons, it was values,\" she replied.",
      "By 19, she left college to book performers at the Cheetah Club in Manhattan. Her friend, Cindy Birdsong, had just joined The Supremes, and introduced de Passe to her boss, Motown founder Berry Gordy, who hired de Passe as his creative assistant.",
      "\"When he decided that I should come to the company, I asked for a contract,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'I don't do contracts.' And I was there for 21 years without one, on a handshake.\"",
      "Part of her job was to find new talent, and that's what she did, when de Passe first heard about a group of brothers from Gary, Indiana. They called themselves The Jackson 5.",
      "\"The hair on the back of my neck stood up. They were great,\" she said.",
      "\"The hair literally stood up?\"",
      "\"Yeah, the hair. This is my big barometer, back there, absolutely. When you feel something, it's not intellectual, at all. I said, 'Oh, my gosh, Mr. Gordy, I saw this great act.' He said, 'Great.' I said, 'Wait till you see these kids.' He said, 'Kids? I don't want any kid acts. Are you crazy?'\"",
      "She wasn't. And Motown introduced The Jackson 5 to the world.",
      "de Passe took them to the dentist, worked on their early dance moves, and even picked out their wardrobe. She found Michael Jackson's hat on 8th Street in Greenwich Village. \"It was iconic, but nobody knew it at the time,\" she said.",
      "In the 1970s, she was discovering and developing artists for Motown in L.A., signing The Commodores, De Barge, and Rick James. \"I feel like I'm lucky to be alive,\" she laughed. Why? \"Because Rick was bigger than life. He was a great consumer of drugs, and just a brilliant, brilliant artist.\"",
      "It is a notorious business, and difficult to navigate, especially back then, especially for her.",
      "I asked, \"You weren't just a woman, you were a Black woman. Are you saying you faced, like, things coming at you, sexism, racism?\"",
      "\"I have had every 'ism' to deal with,\" said de Passe. \"Sexism, racism, pessimism, optimism, you know? And what I've found is that the moment you let yourself be defined by your 'isms' is when you've lost.\"",
      "de Passe always persevered. She was also a good persuader, convincing Diana Ross that the song \"I'm Coming Out\" would be a smash hit. Ross' first reaction, said de Passe, was, \"in very blatant terms, 'I hate these songs.' But I felt it would be [a hit]. Nobody knows. That's the thing about it. Nobody knows.\"",
      "\"But clearly you have really good sixth sense?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe in what I believe in,\" de Passe replied. \"And some of it works and some of it doesn't. But I'm happy to say I have a good percentage.\"",
      "In 1982, de Passe was made president of Motown Productions. One of her first big projects was the TV special \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever.\" Nearly 50 million people watched Michael Jackson do the moonwalk. \"Oh, my God. and it was only six seconds,\" said de Passe. \"But the whole 'Billy Jean' of it all was just magic, I think, because nobody had ever seen anything like that before.\"",
      "de Passe also produced the landmark miniseries \"Lonesome Dove.\"",
      "I said, \"A lot of people would ask, 'What does Motown know about westerns?'\"",
      "\"Probably nothing; but I did,\" de Passe replied. \"I think the death of art is that you have to be gay to play gay. I think the death of art is that you have to be Black to direct or write a Black movie. The death of art is to not have the best person do what it is they are well-suited and passionate to do, regardless of all that other exterior stuff. And I am sick of it.\"",
      "At 78, she is still listening to her ear (and gut), finding new opportunities and stories to tell. And, with her induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Suzanne de Passe is recognized as a true pioneer.",
      "\"I am so grateful to have had that moment to really feel that energy coming back to me,\" she said. \"I will also say, I have worked really, really hard.\"",
      "\"For someone who worked behind the scenes and in the shadows, you felt seen?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh, definitely. I felt very seen, and very blessed.\"",

    "summary": "The multimedia artist talks about his cinematic timepiece, a 24-hour film comprised of scenes from movies and TV that track the viewer's own experience of time, minute by minute, currently screening at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "From time to time, you might notice a shot of a clock in a movie. In a film like \"Back to the Future,\" they're key to the plot; lightning strikes the clock tower at exactly 10:04 p.m. But often, clocks are just ticking away in the background, or not ticking at all, like the watch from \"Pulp Fiction,\" stopped at 11:46.",
      "Compile enough of these seemingly minute details, and minutes can turn into hours, spanning decades of moving-image history. That is the case with artist Christian Marclay's \"The Clock,\" a 24-hour film comprised entirely of clips from movies and television.",
      "\"It's not to create a trick or to make you forget about time,\" Marclay said. \"I want you to be totally conscious about it throughout.\"",
      "Currently on view at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, \"The Clock\" runs on a continuous loop, synced to the precise time of day. When the kids in \"The Breakfast Club\" are whistling at 11:31 a.m., it's 11:31 in real life. An hour later, \"Rain Man\" announces \"Oh, it's 12:31.\" Minute by minute, the footage functions as an actual clock.",
      "Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance at MoMA, calls watching Maclay's mash-up an uncanny experience. \"[You're] watching some of your favorite movies and realizing that it's telling the time that you're living in right now,\" Comer said. \"It's eliminating that barrier between you and the world on-screen.",
      "\"The effort that it took with Christian and the team of researchers locating 'The Clock' footage and all of these different clips is somewhat superhuman,\" he said.",
      "When Marclay won best artist for \"The Clock\" at the 2011 Venice Biennale, it turned him into a contemporary art superstar. But the 70-year-old first made a name for himself decades earlier as part of New York's underground DJ scene. \"In those days, you would find records \u2026 people would put them in their trash,\" he said.",
      "Born to an American mother and Swiss father, Marclay was raised in Switzerland and moved to the U.S. to attend art school in the late 1970s. \"I kept putting aside my work as a visual artist, 'cause I lived in a tiny East Village apartment, and I didn't have a studio,\" he said. \"So, music at that time was convenient.\"",
      "It was, he admitted, easier to store records than canvases. \"But you need tolerant neighbors!\" he laughed.",
      "Marclay's music was experimental. He was an early pioneer of \"turntablism,\" invited to spin on the short-lived show \"Night Music.\" \"I would destroy the records in performance, but then I had all these incredible covers, such an interesting history of graphic design. And I started collaging with them.\"",
      "One of Marclay's early successes in the visual art world arrived via his Body Mix series, in which he physically stitched together album covers to create new forms.",
      "He's unspooled cassette tapes to make prints and pillows. He's cut up everything from Japanese manga to movie subtitles, stacking cinematic fragments nearly 20 feet tall. He said he felt more comfortable as a collagist: \"I'm more interested in working with what exists rather than [to], you know, invent or draw something,\" he said.",
      "In 1995, Marclay created \"Telephones,\" a masterful mashup of film phone conversations.",
      "It's been more than a decade since \"The Clock\" was last in New York. Marclay is extremely precise about where and how it can be screened, insisting that any museum showing the work stay open at least once for 24 hours so audiences can see the nighttime section.",
      "Are there \"Clock\" completists? \"Oh, there are definitely 'Clock' squatters, I would say \u2013     people who really commit to watching it!\" Comer laughed.",
      "But Marclay insists the point isn't to see all of it; it's more to make you hyper-aware of the time you're spending literally watching a clock. \"Here, you're reminded that you have an appointment at a certain time, that you can't spend your whole day watching this thing,\" Marclay said. \"You're more than a viewer. You're a participant in a way, because your life infringes on this clock.\"",

    "summary": "A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in a state with one of the strictest abortion bans.",
    "story": [
      "BATON ROUGE, La.\u00a0\u2014 A New York doctor was indicted by a Louisiana grand jury on Friday for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill online in the Deep South state, which has one of the strictest near-total abortion bans in the U.S.",
      "Grand jurors at the District Court for the Parish of West Baton Rouge issued an indictment against Dr. Margaret Carpenter; her company, Nightingale Medical, PC; and a third person. All three were charged with criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana say a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" District Attorney Tony Clayton said.",
      "The case appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state, at least since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to have strict anti-abortion laws.",
      "\"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me of shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids,\" Clayton said.",
      "Carpenter was also sued by the Texas attorney general in December under similar allegations of sending pills to that state. That case did not involve criminal charges.",
      "CBS News New York reached out to Carpenter, but has not heard back yet.",
      "Testing New York's shield laws",
      "The indictment could be the first direct test of New York's shield laws, which are intended to protect prescribers who use telehealth to provide abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\"Earlier today, a New York doctor was indicted in Louisiana for using telemedicine to prescribe abortion medication to a patient. That's right: a doctor is being prosecuted for providing basic health care to her patient. We always knew that overturning Roe v. Wade wasn't the end of the road for anti-abortion politicians. That's why I worked with the Legislature to pass nation-leading laws to protect providers and patients. It's more critical than ever for states to step up and protect reproductive freedom \u2014 and I'll never back down from this fight,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a prepared release.",
      "Hochul signed the bill protecting doctors from out-of-state lawsuits\u00a0in 2023.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul said in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James, who would enforce the shield law, said in a statement:",
      "\"Abortion care is health care. The criminalization of abortion care is a direct and brazen attack on Americans' bodily autonomy and their right to reproductive freedom. This cowardly attempt out of Louisiana to weaponize the law against out-of-state providers is unjust and un-American. We will not allow bad actors to undermine our providers' ability to deliver critical care. Medication abortion is safe, effective, and necessary, and New York will ensure that it remains available to all Americans who need it.\"",
      "Legal experts say Carpenter may still face some hurdles.",
      "\"What happens when she tries to renew her medical license and she has a pending felony indictment in Louisiana? What happens to the doctor when she tries to fly somewhere and TSA says, hey, you have an active warrant?\" attorney Franz Borghardt said.",
      "Louisiana classifies abortion pills as \"controlled dangerous substances\"",
      "Pills have become the most common means of abortion in the U.S., accounting for nearly two-thirds of them by 2023. They're also at the center of political and legal action over abortion. In January, one judge let three states continue to challenge federal government approvals for how one of the drugs usually involved can be prescribed.",
      "The indictment comes just months after Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \"controlled dangerous substances.\" The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Under the legislation, if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years. The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.",
      "Since the fall of Roe v. Wade, Louisiana has had a near-total abortion ban, without any exceptions for rape or incest. Under the law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.",
      "\"Make no mistake, since Roe v Wade was overturned, we've witnessed a disturbing pattern of interference with women's rights,\" the Abortion Coalition of Telemedicine, where Carpenter is one of the founders, said in a statement. \"It's no secret the United States has a history of violence and harassment against abortion providers, and this state-sponsored effort to prosecute a doctor providing safe and effective care should alarm everyone.\"",
      "Dr. Dara Kass, an emergency medicine physician in New York, said abortion bans are making it more dangerous for young girls and women.",
      "\"It's making it less safe to be pregnant, and it's increasing things like infant mortality and maternal mortality in states where abortions are restricted,\" she said.",

      "Some changes were minor and kept webpages online, like rewording information about Zika virus from saying \"pregnant person\" to \"pregnant woman\" instead.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 16:55:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green said that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" she said. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",

      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",

      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However, CBS News obtained a letter sent from Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official with the Treasury Department, to members of Congress Tuesday, which claimed that DOGE will only have \"read-only\" access to the department's data.",
      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Richard Escobedo and \n                                                  \n                      The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk is categorized as a \"special government employee\" through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending.",
      "Musk's employee status was confirmed by White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Monday, although she added that she wasn't sure whether the Tesla CEO has gained security clearance.",
      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

      "Stocks tumbled on Monday as Wall Street braced for the impact of steep new tariffs ordered by President Trump, with mounting fears the new import duties could spark a trade war that could crimp corporate profits and dampen consumer spending.",
      "However, the losses moderated after Mr. Trump later on Monday said that he would pause the tariffs on Mexico and Canada for one month. His announcement, made on his Truth Social app, came after he said Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum agreed to send 10,000 soldiers to the border. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation is implementing a $1.3 billion plan to protect the border.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 122 points, or 0.3%, to 44,421 after dropping as much as 1.5% in earlier trading. The broad-based S&P 500 lost 0.8%, recovering after dropping as much as 1.9%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index closed 1.2% lower after shedding as much as 2.5%.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs on imports\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Hours later, Canada responded with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well, adding to the potential fallout from a trade war with two of the U.S.' closest trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement prompted some economists to project that the stiff new tariffs could dampen U.S. economic growth and cause an increase in job losses.",
      "\"This development came sooner than we anticipated in our baseline forecast and will lead us to downgrade our 2025 global forecast,\" Oxford Economics wrote in a Feb. 3 research note. \"The latest set of tariffs will lead to weaker GDP growth, higher unemployment, higher interest rates, and higher inflation this year in Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. than in our January baseline forecast.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's promise of tariffs in the lead-up to the election was part of the reason the Federal Reserve dialed back the number of interest rate cuts it expected to impose this year. Originally, the central bank had projected four cuts, but slashed that number to two at their December meeting, citing still-sticky inflation that could worsen under Mr. Trump's trade and immigration policies.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate on Monday confirmed fossil fuel executive Chris Wright to serve as energy secretary, a key post to promote President Trump's efforts to achieve U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market.",
      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He says more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe and has promised to help Mr. Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\"",
      "The Senate approved his nomination, 59-38.",
      "The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill,\" and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats' \"green new scam\" in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "\"President Trump shares my passion for energy,\" Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \"work tirelessly to implement [Mr. Trump's] bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\"",
      "That includes oil and natural gas, coal, nuclear power and hydropower, along with wind and solar power and geothermal energy, Wright said.",
      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican, called Wright an innovator who \"tells the truth about energy production.\"",
      "While Wright \"acknowledges that climate change is real, he knows more American energy is the solution \u2014 not the problem,'' Barrasso said, calling Wright's \"energy realism\" welcome news.",
      "Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Wright \"understands that energy policies should focus on making energy abundant and affordable for families\" and businesses.",
      "\"Our nation deserves a champion for American energy and innovation, and we've got the Wright guy for the job,'\" Lee posted on X.",
      "Colorado's two Democratic senators both supported their home-state nominee.",
      "\"Chris Wright is a scientist who has dedicated his life to the study and use of energy. He believes in science and supports the research that will deliver the affordable, reliable and clean energy\" that will lower costs and make the country more secure, Sen. John Hickenlooper said.",
      "\"While we don't always agree, we will work together because none of us have four years to wait to act,\" Hickenlooper said.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet called Wright a successful Colorado entrepreneur with deep expertise in energy innovation and technology. He pledged to work with Wright to \"ensure Colorado continues to lead the country in energy production and innovation.\"",
      "While acknowledging that climate change is real, Wright said at his hearing that he believes \"there isn't dirty energy or clean energy.\" Rather, he said, there are different sources of energy with different tradeoffs.",
      "Wright, 60, has been chair\u00a0and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",
      "As energy secretary, Wright will join Interior Secretary Doug Burgum as a key player on energy policy. Both will serve on a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said. The council's mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by former President Joe Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.",

      "The salvo, which Mr. Trump had threatened even before returning to power earlier this month, underlines his willingness to use trade policy even against some of the U.S.' largest economic allies. It also signals the president's first major turn away from his promise on the campaign trail to rapidly reduce everyday costs for Americans once in office.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump acknowledged \"some pain\" could come with the new wave of tariffs but insisted his vision for the country \"will all be worth the price that must be paid.\"",

YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!),\" he wrote. \"BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE \u2014 AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!\"",
      "The tariffs\u00a0were slated to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. While the order imposes 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, \"energy resources\" such as oil and gas would only be hit with a 10% tariff.",
      "The order notes that should any of the three nations \"retaliate against the United States\" with \"import duties\" or \"similar measures,\" the president \"may increase or expand in scope the duties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.\"",
      "According to the White House, the salvo is aimed at curbing the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.; spurring a resurgence in domestic manufacturing; and raising federal revenue.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted to social media after the announcement, Mr. Trump said the order was issued through the\u00a0International Emergency Economic Powers Act\u00a0\"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "Trudeau announced in a news conference Saturday night that Canada would retaliate by placing 25% tariffs \"against $155 billion worth of American goods,\" with the first set of tariffs taking effect Tuesday.",
      "\"This will include immediate tariffs on $30 billion worth of goods as of Tuesday, followed by further tariffs on $125 billion worth of American products in 21 days' time to allow Canadian companies and supply chains to seek to find alternatives,\" Trudeau said.",
      "And in a statement posted to social media, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she instructed her economic secretary to put together a response that included both retaliatory tariffs and other measures \"in defense of Mexico's interests.\"",
      "\"We categorically reject the defamatory claims made by the White House accusing the Government of Mexico of having alliances with criminal organizations, as well as any attempts to interfere in our territory,\" Sheinbaum wrote.",
      "John Murphy, senior vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which bills itself as the world's largest business organization, slammed Mr. Trump's decision, writing in a statement that \"the imposition of tariffs under IEEPA is unprecedented, won't solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.\"",
      "Murphy added that the Chamber \"will consult with our members, including main street businesses across the country impacted by this move, to determine next steps to prevent economic harm to Americans.\"",
      "Three trade associations for the distilled spirits industry \u2014 Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S., the Chamber of the Tequila Industry, and Spirits Canada \u2014 said in a joint statement that they were \"deeply concerned that U.S. tariffs on imported spirits from Canada and Mexico will significantly harm all three countries and lead to a cycle of retaliatory tariffs that negatively impacts our shared industry.\"",
      "Bob Hemesath, an Iowa farmer and board chairman of Farmers for Free Trade, an agriculture group that advocates for more open trade, said in a statement that Canada, Mexico and China are \"indispensable markets for the livelihood of the American ag economy,\" and \"placing tariffs on the three largest export markets for American farmers and ranchers, particularly for an extended period of time, would have severe consequences.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the order, writing on social media that Mr. Trump is \"holding Mexico, Canada, and China accountable for their role in the flow of illegal aliens and illicit drugs across our borders. These countries are now on notice to work quickly to stop the madness. This is long overdue.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move in a series of social media posts, one of which read: \"You're worried about grocery prices. Don's raising prices with his tariffs.\"",
      "Experts warn that the impact of the tariffs could affect the economies of Canada, Mexico and China \u2014 the nation's three biggest trading partners \u2014 as well as the U.S. itself. Canada's economy could shrink by 3.6%, while Mexico could take a 2% hit, according to Cornell University economics professor Wendong Zhang.",
      "At the same time, inflation in the U.S. could rise by as much as 1 percentage point, pushing it as high as 4% on an annual basis, or double the Federal Reserve's goal for a 2% annual rate, Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 research note.",
      "\"We have stressed that steep tariff increases against U.S. trading partners could create a stagflationary shock \u2014 a negative economic hit combined with an inflationary impulse \u2014 while also triggering financial market volatility,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in a Jan. 31 report.",
      "Daco added, \"These tariffs against Mexico, Canada and China would mark the first major wave of trade levies in Trump's new term, with effects rippling far beyond those economies, as other nations brace for potential targeting and U.S. businesses navigate supply chain disruptions and retaliation risks.\"",
      "American consumers have been bracing for the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, telling pollsters that they expected to see higher prices if the president followed through on his plans to enact them. Those expectations may have prompted some consumers to purchase goods before Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists say.",
      "\"The mere prospect of tariffs appears to be influencing the behavior of consumers and businesses,\" analysts with Oxford Economics in a research note. \"Imports surged in December, likely an attempt to front-run any tariffs, while consumers may be bringing forward spending in anticipation of tariff-related price hikes.\"",
      "U.S. consumers could see higher prices\u00a0for produce and agricultural products imported from Canada and Mexico, including beef from the former and avocados and strawberries from the latter.

However, Mr. Trump on Monday said he was pausing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after both countries agreed to direct additional resources to their borders.",
      "While Mr. Trump describes tariffs as import duties that are paid by foreign countries, they are in fact paid directly to the federal government by U.S. businesses,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank. Rather than swallowing the costs, corporations typically hike their prices for those imported goods to recoup all or some of the expense.",
      "Who pays the cost?",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "\"From Canada, we import oil, lumber, wood and cement,\" he added. \"Over 20% of the agriculture products we bring into the U.S. come from Mexico.\"",
      "One unknown is whether the Trump administration will carve out some exceptions, such as for oil and gas products. Canada provides about 20% of the oil used in the U.S., which means that a 25% tariff on Canadian imports could add 30 to 40 cents a gallon at the pump within days of the new duties taking effect, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has said.",
      "As painful as higher costs might be to U.S. consumers, the biggest impacts would likely be felt by the Canadian and Mexican economies, according to Wendong Zhang, assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University. A 25% tariff could cause Canada and Mexico to lose 3.6% and 2% of real GDP,\u00a0 respectively, versus a decline of 0.3% for the U.S., Zhang estimated.",
      "Here's what could get pricier for American shoppers if the Trump administration's tariffs take effect.",
      "Avocados, beef and other foods",
      "Inflation-pinched consumers may face a surge in prices for fruits, vegetables and nuts imported from Mexico, including avocados \u2014 just in time for the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion in agricultural products from Mexico in 2023, including fresh strawberries, raspberries, tomatoes and beef, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The U.S. also imports Mexican beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. imported about $40 billion of Canadian agricultural products that same year, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "A 25% tariff could push prices up for all those products.",
      "\"Grocery stores operate on really tiny margins,\" said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute. \"They can't eat the tariffs ... especially when you talk about things like avocados that basically all of them \u2014 90% \u2014 come from Mexico. You're talking about guacamole tariffs right before the Super Bowl.\"",
      "Cars",
      "American consumers are increasingly buying cars that are either built in Canada or Mexico or that use parts imported from those nations. The U.S. imported $69 billion of cars and light trucks from Mexico in 2023, and another $37 billion from Canada, according to S&P Global Mobility.",
      "On top of that, about $78 billion in auto parts stemmed from Mexico and $20 billion from Canada. For instance, the engines used in Ford's F-series pickup trucks come from Canada.",
      "Because U.S. importers are expected to roll any added tariff costs into vehicle sticker prices, the average U.S. automobile price could jump by about $3,000, TD Economics estimates. That would come at a time when the average new car already sells for $50,000 and the average used car for $26,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Lumber",
      "About one-third of softwood lumber used in the U.S. is imported from Canada each year, according to Rajan Parajuli, an associate professor of forest economics and policy at North Carolina State University.",
      "Tacking a 25% tariff on Canadian lumber could cause a \"supply shock,\" the Forest Resources Association, a trade group, wrote in a December blog post. \"Regarding lumber, the U.S. still needs Canadian supplies to meet its domestic consumption demand,\" the group said.",
      "Still, the slow U.S. housing market, dampened by mortgage rates that remain close to 7%, could make it hard for companies to pass on the new tariffs through higher lumber prices, some economists said.",

    "summary": "President Trump is directing his commerce and treasury secretaries to create what's called an American sovereign wealth fund.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday took the first steps toward his administration creating a government-owned investment fund, tasking the heads of the Treasury Department and Commerce Department with beginning the process to create an American sovereign wealth fund.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order that charges Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Commerce Department, with beginning a process \"that will hopefully result in the creation of an American sovereign wealth fund,\" announced Will Scharf, Mr. Trump's staff secretary.",
      "\"We're going to create a lot of wealth for the fund, and I think it's about time this country had a sovereign wealth fund,\" the president told reporters in the Oval Office Monday, calling the news \"very exciting.\"",
      "The president said the U.S. may somehow put TikTok in the sovereign wealth fund. A law that took effect in January was meant to ban the app in the U.S. unless its Chinese parent company sold it, but Mr. Trump has delayed enforcement of the law, keeping it alive for now.",
      "Bessent said the creation of the fund will \"monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet for the American people.\" He said the sovereign wealth fund will be up and running within 12 months, putting U.S. assets to work for Americans. The treasury secretary said the Trump administration will study best practices around the world to develop the fund.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds generally use a nation's reserves and invest the funds to generate returns, which can be used to address deficits, pay down debts or bolster savings. It's unclear what types of safeguards would be placed around a U.S.-owned investment fund to ensure it has transparent reporting obligations and that the investments aren't benefiting political allies.",
      "Other countries that have a sovereign wealth fund include China, Singapore, New Zealand, Norway and Saudi Arabia, among others.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the Government Pension Fund of Norway, is the largest in the world, with assets valued at $1.7 trillion, a substantial figure for a country of 5.5 million people. The Norwegian government is only permitted to spend a small part of the fund each year, but the total amounts to nearly 20% of its annual budget.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:43:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump is an avowed supporter of tariffs, but many experts say such trade measures can boost inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, authorized a\u00a0wave of new import duties\u00a0Saturday on America's three closest trading partners \u2014 Mexico, Canada and China. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada were later put on pause for a month.",
      "Although tariffs are a bane to most economists, they are a widely used as a tool for regulating international trade and for shielding domestic industries from foreign competition. At the simplest level, tariffs are taxes placed on goods made overseas that are imported into the country. Notably, foreign companies aren't responsible for paying the duties. Instead, U.S. businesses directly pay the tariffs on their imported goods to the federal government, according to the Tax Foundation, a tax-focused think tank.",
      "Because American businesses are on the hook for paying the tariffs on imports, they historically have passed on some or all of those costs to consumers. At the same time, tariff proponents like Mr. Trump argue that such levies can help protect manufacturers here at home. For instance, consumers may opt to buy U.S.-made products rather than newly pricier imports, while companies may choose to avoid tariffs by opening new plants in the U.S.",
      "\"Come make your product in America,\" Mr. Trump said last week at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland. \"But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then very simply you will have to pay a tariff.\"",
      "Many economists and other trade experts say tariffs are not beneficial. The Peterson Institute for International Economics points out that tariffs \"have a poor record\" of sparking a resurgence in manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday signed an executive order that imposes 25%\u00a0tariffs\u00a0on imports from Canada and Mexico, while adding an additional 10% levy on goods from China. Canada responded hours later with retaliatory tariffs of its own, while Mexico said it was also planning to issue tariffs on the U.S. as well.",
      "However, Mr. Trump on Monday wrote on his Truth Social app that he is\u00a0pausing U.S. tariffs\u00a0targeting imports from Mexico for a month after the country's president agreed to send 10,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to combat the flow of fentanyl and migrants. The tariffs on Canada were also paused a short time later.",
      "Mr. Trump has also floated the possibility of additional tariffs, such as an across-the-board duty of 10% on all goods imported into the U.S. Here's what to know about tariffs.",
      "What exactly are tariffs?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S..",
      "The most common type are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value, which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of the imports. These are the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed as a 25% import tax on goods shipped from Mexico or Canada, such as avocados or lumber.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, such as if the U.S. were to propose a $1 tariff on each imported Mexican avocado.",
      "Another such type of levy are \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold. For instance, this type of quota was used by the first Trump administration in 2018 on\u00a0washing machines, when the first 1.2 million imported units faced a 20% duty, while units above that number were taxed at a 50% rate, according to the Coalition for a Prosperous America, which advocates for more restrictive trade policies.",
      "Who pays for tariffs?",
      "Companies that import the goods from abroad pay the tariffs to their own nation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects tariffs from importers \u2014 say, Walmart or Target \u2014 and then deposits the money into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has\u00a0claimed\u00a0that foreign countries pay the duties. As part of his campaign, he vowed that tariffs would help raise \"trillions and trillions of dollars\" from foreign governments.",
      "In fact, American consumers would likely bear the brunt of the cost, as big U.S. importers are likely to pass on the tariffs they pay to the customs department to consumers, economists say. In some cases, foreign manufacturers may also choose to lower their prices to offset the impact of those tariffs in order to maintain their sales. And some U.S. businesses could absorb some of the tariff costs to avoid driving away consumers and potentially losing market share to competitors.",
      "If Mr. Trump enacts all the tariffs he's vowed to levy on imports, the typical U.S. consumer could face up to $2,400 in increased costs for every year the tariffs remain in force, according to an estimate from financial services firm ING.",
      "Could tariffs boost inflation?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs would sharply push the current effective U.S. tariff rate from 2.4% to 31%. That would be a historic high and surpass those seen under President McKinley in the 1890s, when U.S. trade policies were far more protectionist, and during the 1930s under the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, according to Capital Economics.",
      "As a result, inflation would likely jump, rising from an annual rate of about 2.9% currently to as high as 4%, or about double the Federal Reserve's 2% target, Capital Economics noted. That would put inflation back to its mid-2023 levels, when the Fed was keeping interest rates near a two-decade as it tried bring inflation under control.",
      "\"[I]mposing any of these suggested tariffs would generate a rebound in consumer price inflation this year, taking it further above target and making it harder for the Fed to resume loosening monetary policy,\" Capital Economics said in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "Why does Trump support tariffs?",
      "President Trump cites tariffs as a way to accomplish several policy goals, including raising more money to fund the government and protecting domestic industries.",
      "Both he and his allies, including his new Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0contend that tariffs enacted during the first Trump administration didn't boost inflation. But those tariffs, which applied to only some Chinese imports, \"were too small to matter\" and so didn't have an inflationary impact, Capital Economics said in its research note.",
      "Mr. Trump has also cited the need to boost U.S. manufacturing, saying in an October interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "The data to support that claim is mixed. The tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal to some extent, with the Brookings Institution\u00a0noting\u00a0that jobs in a few industries may have rebounded, such as adding 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other washing machine manufacturers.",
      "Overall, the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers. A range of factors could account for that decline, such as the impact of the pandemic and broader economic issues facing manufacturing.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 11:41:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Norway is inching incredibly close to its goal of selling only zero-emission new vehicles, but advocates say incentives must be kept in place.",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",
      "They have also benefitted from toll exemptions, free parking in public car parks, and the use of public transport traffic lanes.",
      "How Norway has driven the EV transition",
      "While some tax breaks and incentives have been rolled back over the years, electric cars have become commonplace on Norwegian roads.",
      "\"It was a decision primarily motivated by climate and environment considerations,\" Frode Hvattum, a 50-year-old father of three who owns two EVs, told AFP.",
      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",
      "In his upscale neighborhood of Baerum in suburban Oslo, the streets are full of Teslas, Audis and Volkswagens. Competitively priced Chinese brands are increasingly appearing too.",
      "Many homes have a garage with an EV charger, in addition to Norway's vast national network of superfast charging stations that keep the nation rolling.",
      "That was a precondition for Hvattum, who, like many Norwegians, travels frequently by car to his chalet in the mountains several hours from Oslo.",
      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",
      "\"We should finish the year at between 95 and 100%, and probably even in the high end of this range,\" Christina Bu, head of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, told AFP.",
      "A new tax increase on internal combustion cars and rechargeable hybrids \u2014 which are cleaner but still run partially on gas or diesel \u2014 on April 1 should help.",
      "In January, diesel cars \u2014 still common in much of Europe \u2014\u00a0accounted for just 1.5% of new cars registered in Norway, and gasoline cars just 0.4%, according to the OFV.",
      "\"Political leaders can't rest on their laurels,\" Bu warned. \"They have to maintain the advantages, such as the toll discounts, so the transition to EVs spreads on the second-hand market.\"",

Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",

      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",

      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

      "On the wall next to the terminal, a teacher had tacked up a half sheet of paper with the most rudimentary directions to get started, including how to sign in and which keys to press when something went wrong. It also warned ominously that typing \u00a0\"'PRINT' WITHOUT A STATEMENT NUMBER MAY CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL.\"",
      "The page included a sample program written in BASIC telling the computer how to add two numbers.",
      "Ready . . .",
      "10 INPUT X,Y",
      "20 LET A=X+Y",
      "30 PRINT A",
      "40 END",
      "That was probably the first computer program I ever typed in. The elegance of the four lines of code appealed to my sense of order. Its instantaneous answer was like a jolt of electricity. From there, I wrote the first computer program of my own\u2014a game of tic-tac-toe. Getting it to work forced me to think through for the first time the most basic elements of the game's rules. Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

      "President Trump has fired the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Rohit Chopra, in the latest purge of a Biden Administrator holdover.",
      "Chopra was one of the more important regulators from the previous Democratic administration who was still on the job since Mr. Trump took office on Jan. 20. In a letter to the president shared on social media, Chopra said it was an \"extraordinary privilege\" to serve as director of the CFPB.",
      "\"With so much power concentrated in the hands of a few, agencies like the CFPB have never been more critical,\" he wrote. \"I'm proud that the CFPB has done so much to restore the rule of law.\"",
      "Chopra was notified of his firing via an email from the White House, a person familiar with the notice who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly told the Associated Press.",

    "summary": "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada starting Saturday, as well as a 10% tariff on China.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump will enact 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada starting Feb. 1, as well as a 10% tariff on imports from China, according to White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" Leavitt said at a White House briefing on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he's\u00a0targeting Canada and Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the nation's biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S. The president has also said tariffs will generate money for the federal government, although the import duties are paid by U.S. importers. Companies such as Walmart, Target and other U.S. importers typically pass tariff-related costs onto American consumers.",
      "Asked whether Mr. Trump's new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China would include any exemptions, Leavitt said she didn't have information about that issue.",
      "Mr. Trump's goals include narrowing the trade surplus between those nations and the U.S. The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Experts warn that steep new tariffs on imports could cause U.S. economic growth to slow and inflation to flare, noting that companies in the U.S. are likely to pass on the added costs to consumers. A sustained burst of inflation, in turn, could also deter the Federal Reserve from pushing down borrowing costs, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "Even the prospect of higher import duties is influencing spending by consumers and businesses, according to Oxford Economics. Analysts with the investment adviser note that U.S. imports surged in December, a sign Americans are buying appliances, furniture and other goods now to get ahead of possible price increases.",
      "Retaliation risks",
      "A volley of new U.S. tariffs is likely to invite swift retaliation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that his country is prepared to fire back if Mr. Trump proceeds with his plan, but he did not give details.",
      "\"We're ready with a response, a purposeful, forceful but reasonable, immediate response,\" he said. \"It's not what we want, but if he moves forward, we will also act.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico has conferred with Trump's team since before he returned to the White House, but she emphasized that Mexico has a \"Plan A, Plan B, Plan C for what the United States government decides.\"",
      "\"Now it is very important that the Mexican people know that we are always going to defend the dignity of our people, we are always going to defend the respect of our sovereignty and a dialogue between equals, as we have always said, without subordination,\" she said.",
      "The ultimate economic damage from the U.S. tariffs would hinge on how long they are in place, Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator, told the Associated Press.",
      "If it's just a few days, \"that's one thing. If they are in place for weeks onto months, we're going to see supply chain disruptions, higher costs for U.S. manufacturers, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers,\" said Cutler, now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \"It could have macroeconomic impacts. It could affect the stock market. Then internationally it could lead to more tension with our trading partners and make it harder for us to work with them.\"",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's pick to head the Department of Health and Human Services, faces scrutiny for fees he may earn from lawsuits against Merck.",
    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings to serve as the nation's top health official play out on Capitol Hill, President Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services is facing scrutiny not only for his anti-vaccine views, but whether he profits from them.",
      "If confirmed, Kennedy would wield control over federal vaccine policy and the regulation of drugmakers, even as he stands to potentially profit from vaccine-related litigation.",
      "How Kennedy made money from lawsuits",
      "Kennedy for years has earned referral fees from Wisner Baum, a Los Angeles personal injury law firm that is currently suing Merck, alleging the pharmaceutical giant failed to properly warn the public about risks from its vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV), Gardasil, according to financial disclosure documents filed by Kennedy with the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Wisner Baum is representing a plaintiff in a trial against Merck and other lawsuits are in the works in North Carolina.",
      "\"An overwhelming body of scientific evidence, including more than 30 years of research and development along with real world evidence generated by Merck and by independent investigators, continues to support the safety and efficacy profiles of our HPV vaccines,\" Rahway, New Jersey-based Merck said Tuesday in a\u00a0statement on the litigation. \"The plaintiff's allegations have no merit, and we remain committed to vigorously defending against these claims in the upcoming trial.\"",
      "In a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, repeatedly asked Kennedy if he would agree to forgo payments stemming from litigation against drugmakers after disclosing in Ethics Office filings that he might collect legal fees for referring potential plaintiffs in Wisner Baum's suits against Merck over its HPV vaccine, which is to prevent cervical cancer.",
      "Kennedy has made about $2.5 million since 2022 in his work with the law firm, including $850,000 last year, public records show. Kennedy, himself a longtime personal injury lawyer, could earn even more if the litigation against Merck prevails given that he is opting to keep his stake in the pending court case, according to ethics documents filed before his confirmation hearings.",
      "Kennedy has a consulting arrangement to refer cases to Wisner Baum, which is pursuing cases related to the HPV vaccine Gardasil. If Kennedy is confirmed, he said he would resign from that arrangement.",
      "\"I am entitled to receive 10% of fees awarded in contingency fee cases referred to the firm,\" Kennedy stated in his ethics pledge. According to the document, Kennedy will retain an interest in cases that do not involve the U.S. as a party and in which the U.S. does not have a \"direct and substantial interest.\"",
      "At the same time, Kennedy vowed to divest his rights to payment in contingency fee cases in which the U.S. is a party or has a direct or large interest to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\"",
      "Financial conflict of interest?",
      "Kennedy's plan to continue collecting contingency fees while serving as Health and Human Services secretary raises questions as a matter of ethics and policy, according to Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, \"It's very unusual for a cabinet secretary to retain an interest in contingency fee litigation,\" Clark told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's troubling.\"",
      "For example, if Kennedy stands to financially gain in lawsuits against Merck or other drugmakers, his impartiality as HHS secretary could face scrutiny if the companies faced a federal enforcement action or submitted a drug for government approval, Clark added.",
      "Wisner Baum said it hasn't paid Kennedy for his work linked to the firm's suits against Merck, which is just getting started in California.",
      "The firm \"has only compensated Mr. Kennedy for Monsanto Roundup-induced non-Hodgkins lymphoma cases, Woolsey Fire cases and Paradise/Camp Fire cases. All of these cases alleged corporate wrongdoing that caused life-changing harm to victims,\" Wisner Baum said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We are currently in trial in the first Gardasil case in Los Angeles. We hope, like in Roundup, soundbites take a backseat to truth, take a backseat to actual evidence, and a jury returns a verdict sending the same message multiple juries did in Roundup \u2014 consumers deserve to know the truth, and politics has nothing to do with it,\" said Wisner Baum's managing partner, R. Brent Wisner, alluding to long-running ligation against Monsanto, now owned by Germany's Bayner, over a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer.",
      "Kennedy also made another $326,056 in salary and benefits from the Children's Health Defense, which he founded and formerly chaired, according to his ethics filings. The nonprofit has filed dozens of state and federal lawsuits challenging vaccine and public health mandates. Its targets include the federal agencies that Kennedy would run at HHS.",
      "During the hearing, Warren pointed to several changes Kennedy could make that might enrich him in connection with such lawsuits if he is approved as health secretary. That includes appointing anti-vaccine advocates to vaccine advisory panels, removing vaccines from recommendations or changing the way the vaccine injury compensation program works.",
      "Kennedy would not commit to Warren's request to forgo contingency fees while serving as HHS secretary. However, in written responses\u00a0to Warren on Friday, Kennedy agreed to amend his ethics agreement, a document that should be \"thoroughly reviewed\" before the Senate moves forward on Kennedy's nominatioin, the senator's office stated.",
      "\"It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,\" Warren said in a statement on Friday.",
      "A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a phone message requesting comment. Representatives for the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "MAHA trademark pending",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican of Idaho, asked Kennedy if there was \"anything that you are aware of in your background that might present a conflict of interest within the duties of the office to which you have been nominated?\"",
      "Kennedy replied \"No, Mr. Chairman.\"",
      "As part of the confirmation proceedings, Kennedy in December disclosed earning $100,000 from variations of his slogan, \"Make America Healthy Again\" and its abbreviation \u2014 MAHA \u2014 on stickers, hats and hoodies. Kennedy had in recent months applied for trademark protection for the phrase, setting the stage for marketing supplements, vitamins, essential oils and cryptocurrency, according to documents filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",

    "title": "Is Trump about to lead the U.S. into a trade war? Here's what to know.",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Jan 2025 14:13:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Less than two weeks into his second term, President Trump is poised to deploy steep tariffs against key U.S. trading partners.",
    "story": [
      "On the day of his inauguration, President Trump threatened steep new tariffs against key U.S. trading partners. Now he is primed to deliver.",
      "\"The president will be implementing tomorrow 25% tariffs on Mexico, 25% tariffs on Canada and a 10% tariff on China, for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country, which has killed tens of millions of Americans,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said at a Jan. 31 press briefing.",
      "Leavitt's confirmation of the tariffs comes after Trump on Thursday reiterated his earlier threat this month that he could announce 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1, telling reporters from the Oval Office that the duties \"may or may not rise with time.\" He had previously warned China could face a 10% tariff.",
      "Economists have warned that stiff tariffs\u00a0could reawaken U.S. inflation on a range of consumer goods and slow economic growth. Here's what experts have to say.",
      "Why is Trump threatening to hit countries with tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened tariffs against multiple nations for a range of reasons. He said he is specifically\u00a0targeting Canada, Mexico\u00a0\u2014 the U.S.' biggest trading partners \u2014 along with China, with tariffs to compel them to halt the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S., as well as to narrow their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit with Canada has surged from $31 billion in 2019 to $72 billion in 2023, largely reflecting growing American imports of Canadian energy. Over that same period, the gap with Mexico has grown from $106 billion in 2019 to $161 billion as the U.S. curtails imports from China and brings more electronic items, shoes and other products from south of the border.",
      "Before Mr. Trump returned to power, he also had threatened tariffs of up to\u00a060% on Chinese goods\u00a0imported into the U.S., a measure experts say is intended to advance American interests in negotiating better trade terms with Beijing, as well as throttle the illegal entry of fentanyl into the country.",
      "In a show of how his administration uses tariff threats to pressure countries on other issues, Mr. Trump last week proposed potential 25% levies against Colombia unless it agreed to receive deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Colombia ultimately agreed to receive the immigrants,\u00a0and the tariffs were withheld.",
      "Colombia's about-face suggests that Canada and Mexico could also reach agreement with the U.S. and avert a painful trade war. To that end, Howard Lutnick, Mr. Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, said at his confirmation hearing Wednesday that Canada and Mexico could avoid tariffs by closing their borders to fentanyl.",
      "\"As far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff,\" Lutnick told senators.",
      "Even so, Mr. Trump's brandishing of potential tariffs \u2014 even if they are never imposed \u2014 highlights his willingness to use tough trade measures to punish even the country's closest allies unless they make concessions.",
      "\"As we have previously noted, trade policy will be transactional over the next four years with protectionist measures used to extort trade, immigration and other political concessions,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "What exactly is Trump planning?",
      "Along with targeting Canada and Mexico, the Trump administration has floated the possibility of a blanket tariff on a range of countries in Asia, South America, Europe and other regions.",
      "\"I think we have to proceed on the assumption that some kinds of tariffs are going to be imposed on the United States' major trading partners,\" Brett House, professor of economics at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In the end, there is a lot that gets announced by the president on social media that does not come to pass. I don't take it as bluffing, so much as a storm of possibilities, and it's hard to tell which bit of that storm is going to be pursued most aggressively, and most immediately.\"",
      "What's clear, by contrast, is that the new administration is picking up where Mr. Trump left off in his first term in using trade policy as an instrument of both economic and foreign policy. That is likely to lead to a period of uncertainty and volatility, said John Lash, group vice president of product strategy at supply-chain software firm E2open.",
      "\"A lot of alternatives are still possible,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch in an interview. \"We don't know, but game theory would suggest the president would implement tariffs in some form against Mexico and Canada \u2014 not blanket tariffs, but on a select number of imports from both nations... because otherwise his bluff is going to be called.\"",
      "On how soon any tariffs could take effect, Daco notes that Mr. Trump could move quickly by claiming authority under a 1977 law known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "\"When he said he'll impose tariffs on Feb. 1, it is still an open question as to what means would be used. Do you want to implement tariffs immediately, as threatened against Colombia over the weekend, or are you threatening with a deadline to obtain concessions?\" Daco said.",
      "Would the U.S. face retaliation?",
      "Almost certainly, economists say. If Trump officials move ahead with tariffs on its northern neighbor, \"We anticipate Canada would then respond in kind by also implementing a 25% across-the-board tariff on U.S. imports,\" Satyam Panday, chief U.S. and Canada economist with S&P Global Ratings, said in an email.",
      "Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, previously vowed to remove U.S.-made alcoholic beverages from stores in the Canadian province, according to the Associated Press. Canada is the world's second-largest market for America's distilled spirits, behind European Union.",
      "Elijah Oliveros-Rosen, chief emerging markets economist at S&P Global Ratings, predicted Mexico also would fire back with targeted tariffs. \"In the case of Mexico, we think it's very unlikely the government would place tariffs on U.S.-manufactured imports, given most are intermediate goods eventually exported to the U.S. Therefore, we expect the Mexican government could impose tariffs on agricultural and food imports, but not manufacturing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that strengthening the U.S.' stance on trade issues will help protect American workers and lead to a resurgence of domestic manufacturing. Yet such policies could come at the cost of damaging critical relationships with other nations around the world, said Douglas Irwin, a U.S. trade policy expert and professor of economics at Dartmouth College.",
      "What is the risk to American consumers?",
      "Irwin and other economists say tariffs are all but certain to lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. That's because companies that end up on the hook typically pass added costs along to consumers in order to protect their bottom lines.",
      "\"The notion this administration has been adhering to is somewhat surprising \u2014 the idea that if you implement gradual tariffs over time, such as in 5% increments, that these are less inflationary,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This idea is misguided, because if you have incremental price increases month after month, if anything that leads to higher inflation expectations. It leads to higher inflation on a month-to-month basis.\"",
      "If Mr. Trump's tariffs are implemented in full, including a universal 10% tax on all goods, consumer price inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%, according to an analysis this week from Capital Economics. To be sure, analysts with the investment advisory firm expect Mr. Trump to stop short of imposing a blanket tariff and instead pick his targets.",
      "Matthew Holmes, chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, suggested that a volley of tariffs between the countries would also impact U.S. consumers.",
      "\"From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose,\" he said in an email.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Federal officials approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid\u200b medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal officials on Thursday approved a new type of pain drug designed to eliminate the risks of addiction and overdose associated with opioid medications like Vicodin and OxyContin.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved Vertex Pharmaceuticals' pill, Journavx, for short-term pain that often follows surgery or injuries.",
      "It's the first new pharmaceutical approach to treating pain in more than 20 years, offering an alternative to both opioids and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. But the medication's modest effectiveness and lengthy development process underscore the challenges of finding new ways to manage pain.",
      "Two studies in more than 870 patients with acute pain following foot and abdominal surgeries showed Vertex's drug provided more relief than a dummy pill but didn't outperform a common opioid-acetaminophen combination pill.",
      "\"It's not a slam dunk on effectiveness,\" said Michael Schuh of the Mayo Clinic, a pharmacist and pain medicine expert who wasn't involved in the research. \"But it is a slam dunk in that it's a very different pathway and mechanism of action, so I think that shows a lot of promise.\"",
      "Vertex began researching the drug in the 2000s, when drug overdoses were rocketing upward, principally driven by mass prescribing of opioid painkillers for common ailments like arthritis and back pain. Prescriptions have fallen sharply in the last decade and the current wave of the opioid epidemic is mainly due to illicit fentanyl, not pharmaceutical medicines.",
      "Opioids reduce pain by binding to receptors in the brain that receive nerve signals from different parts of the body. Those chemical interactions also give rise to opioids' addictive effects.",
      "Vertex's drug works differently, blocking proteins that trigger pain signals that are later sent to the brain.",
      "\"In trying to develop medicines that don't have the addictive risks of opioid medicines, a key factor is working to block pain signaling before it gets to the brain,\" Vertex's Dr. David Altshuler, told the Associated Press last year.",
      "Commonly reported side effects with the drug were nausea, constipation, itching, rash and headache.",
      "\"The new medication has side effect profiles that are inherently not only different, but don't involve the risk of substance abuse and other key side effects associated with opioids,\" said Dr. Charles Argoff of the Albany Medical Center, who consulted for Vertex on the drug's development.",
      "The initial concept to focus on pain-signaling proteins came out of research involving people with a rare hereditary condition that causes insensitivity to pain.",
      "Vertex has attracted interest from Wall Street for its ambitious drug pipeline that involves winning FDA approval for multiple drugs across several forms of chronic pain, which generally represents a bigger financial opportunity than acute pain.",
      "But the Boston drugmaker's share price plummeted in December when Vertex reported disappointing mid-stage results in a study of patients with chronic nerve pain affecting the lower back and legs. The drug didn't perform significantly better than placebo, the research found.",
      "\"We believe the data reflect a near worst-case scenario for this key pipeline program,\" biotechnology analyst Brian Abrahams said in a research note to investors, adding that the results jeopardized estimates that Vertex's pipeline could be worth billions across multiple forms of pain.",
      "Still, Vertex executives said they plan to move forward with a new, late-stage study of the drug, theorizing that a different trial design could yield better results and pave the way for FDA approval in chronic pain.",

      "Bondi's nomination for attorney general was approved by the upper chamber 54 to 46, with one Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans in voting to confirm her. She will take over as the nation's top law enforcement officer as Mr. Trump has pledged to end what he calls the weaponization of the Justice Department and threatened to target his critics.",
      "During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Bondi said she would \"not politicize\" the department and said \"justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country.\"",
      "\"If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"Under my watch, the partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "In the days since Mr. Trump began his second term in office, the Senate has been working to confirm his Cabinet picks. The GOP-led upper chamber installed the top members of his national security team first and now is moving to approve the remaining nominees who will lead federal departments.",
      "Bondi's nomination was first approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a 12-10 party-line vote before it was considered by the upper chamber.",
      "As attorney general, Bondi will oversee a sprawling department that includes numerous law enforcement components, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Both agencies have often been the target of attacks by Mr. Trump. The president selected another staunch defender, Kash Patel, to lead the FBI.",
      "Bondi will also have the power to investigate the federal probes involving Mr. Trump that were overseen by former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith resigned from the role before the president returned to office, and the two cases brought against Mr. Trump were dismissed because of longstanding Justice Department policy that precludes the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Now, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, his administration has been overseeing the ouster of certain Justice Department employees. Acting Attorney General James McHenry, selected by the president to temporarily lead the department, fired roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for Smith because \"he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official said.",
      "And department leadership directed the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, to terminate prosecutors who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to a Jan. 31 memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "At the FBI, which is a component of the Justice Department, the acting deputy attorney general ordered the acting head of the bureau to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "FBI supervisors have also received questionnaires for certain agents in their field offices that contain questions about their possible work on the Jan. 6 cases, such as whether they participated in a search, if they made any arrests or testified in court.",
      "Bondi has previously suggested that the Justice Department prosecutors who were involved in the cases against Mr. Trump would face their own investigation and has repeated the president's claim that there is a so-called deep state of career government employees working to undermine him.",
      "\"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them,\" she told Fox News after he was charged in 2023.",
      "Bondi takes the helm of the Justice Department without the federal prosecution experience that her predecessors have had. She served two terms as Florida's attorney general, during which her office led lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act and former President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "After leaving office in 2019, she worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for Ballard Partners, a Florida-based firm. During her tenure there, she represented corporations including General Motors, Amazon and Uber, and lobbied on behalf of the Qatari government, according to registration forms submitted to the federal government.",
      "Bondi briefly left her post at Ballard Partners to serve as a member of Mr. Trump's defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats in his first term. She defended Mr. Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which he pressured Zelenskyy to investigate former President Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democrat-led House, becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached, and acquitted by the Republican-led Senate following a trial, where Bondi was part of Mr. Trump's team.",
      "She also spearheaded legal efforts following the 2020 election to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and falsely asserted Mr. Trump won the battleground state. Bondi told the Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation hearing that she accepts the results of the election.",
      "Mr. Trump selected Bondi for attorney general after his first pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, withdrew his name from consideration. Gaetz had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, and he denied any wrongdoing.",

    "summary": "In a news conferrence with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump said the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and \"own it.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would \"take over the Gaza Strip\" and \"own it,\" continued to promote the idea that the Palestinian people should live elsewhere.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose comments came at a joint news conference with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu, said the Palestinians in Gaza \"should not go through a process of rebuilding\" and that they had \"lived a miserable existence there.\" Earlier in the afternoon, during a meeting with Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said the Palestinians should \"resettle permanently\" in \"nice homes\" somewhere else.",
      "\"The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings \u2014\u00a0 level it out. Create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and housing for the people of the area. Do a real job. Do something different.\"",
      "\"Just can't go back,\" he continued. \"If you go back, it's gonna end up the same way it has for a hundred years.\"",
      "On whether U.S. troops would be sent to Gaza, the president said, \"As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. If it's necessary, we'll do that.\"",
      "\"We're going to take over that piece,\" Mr. Trump added. \"We're going to develop it, create thousands and thousands of jobs, and it'll be something that the entire Middle East can be very proud of.\"",
      "The president was asked by a reporter what authority he has to take over a sovereign territory, and he replied that he's studied the matter closely for months.",
      "\"I do see a long-term ownership position, and I see it bringing great stability to that part of the Middle East, and maybe the entire Middle East,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president said his decision about taking over Gaza \"was not a decision\u00a0 made lightly,\" and he claimed he's received praise from other leaders in the Middle East, though he did not identify any by name. Netanyahu said Mr. Trump's team is considering the options.",
      "Leaders of several of the most powerful Arab nations previously said they strongly opposed any suggestion that residents of Gaza be resettled in other countries.",
      "In the past, Mr. Trump has voiced support for a \"realistic two-state solution.\" Gaza, a 139-square-mile strip of land that shares borders with Israel and Egypt, has been fought over for years. Palestinians have been refugees for decades, since Israel gained control of it in the 1967 Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria.",
      "Asked who would eventually live in Gaza once it's rebuilt, Mr. Trump said it should be an international place.",
      "\"I envision world people living there, the world's people,\" he said, adding that the residents should be \"representatives from all over the world, Palestinians, also.\" He said it would be \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"",
      "Netanyahu is the first foreign leader to visit Mr. Trump in his second term.",
      "Mr. Trump opened the news conference by reinforcing his warm relationship with Netanyahu, saying they had forged a successful partnership in his first term. He claimed that the last four years \u2014 under former President Joe Biden \u2014 had not seen as many successes.",
      "He claimed \"the grave damage around the globe that was done, including in the Middle East \u2026 the horrors of Oct. 7 would never have happened if I were president.\"",
      "In the wake of the massacre of Israeli civilians in 2023, however, Netanyahu praised Biden \"for his vital support for Israel.\"",
      "Netanyahu suggested Mr. Trump may be unconventional, but he has good ideas, and they work well together.",
      "\"After the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, 'You know, he's right,'\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters he found he had something else in common with Mr. Trump, too \u2014 he said Iran has tried to kill them both.",
      "Trump, Netanyahu meet in Oval Office before news conference",
      "Seated next to Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump repeatedly said he doesn't think Palestinians want to return to Gaza and said that he thinks Jordan, Egypt and other nations would accept Palestinians, even though they've said they won't.",
      "\"They are not gonna want to go back to Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that Palestinians would only \"end up dying\" there, and suggesting Palestinians should have a permanent settlement elsewhere.",
      "\"If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes and where they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death, like what's happening in Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And right now you have in Gaza a very dangerous situation in terms of explosives all over the place, in terms of tunnels that nobody knows who's in the tunnel. The whole thing is a mess.\"",
      "The president said other \"rich\" nations should pay for a new home for Palestinians, although he did not expand on this suggestion.",
      "Netanyahu largely allowed Mr. Trump to speak. One reporter asked the Israeli prime minister whether former President Joe Biden or Mr. Trump is more responsible for the hostage and ceasefire deal.",
      "\"I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort,\" Netanyahu replied.",
      "The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered in part by the U.S., continues to hold so far. Dual citizen Keith Siegel was the first American to be released since the implementation began last month, although other Americans have been released before.",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu said he would discuss \"victory over Hamas\" with Mr. Trump, as well as countering Iran and building on diplomatic relationships with Arab nations.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday that he has \"no guarantees that the peace is going to hold.\"",
      "The president's meeting with Netanyahu being his first with a foreign leader signals how the Trump White House views the U.S.-Israel relationship.",
      "\"Trump is going to continue his support for our great ally, Israel,\" national security adviser Mike Waltz said on Fox News Tuesday.",
      "Waltz said the U.S. and Israel have \"more to go\" in terms of returning Americans held hostage. And the national security adviser said the U.S. has to think \"realistically\" about rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"I would push back on the characterization of cleaning out Gaza,\" Waltz told reporters Tuesday. \"I think President Trump is looking at this from a humanitarian standpoint. You have these people that are sitting with literally thousands of unexploded ordnance and piles of rubble. You know, at some point we have to look realistically. How do you rebuild Gaza? What does that look like? What's the timeline? I think we, a lot of people, were looking at very unrealistic timelines. We're talking 10, 15, years, not the five years. And so that is what, that's what we have to work through. That's part of what we'll work through with Prime Minister Netanyahu.\"",
      "Netanyahu last met with Mr. Trump in July at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, while Mr. Trump was still a presidential candidate.",
      "Netanyahu congratulated former President Joe Biden on his win in 2020, something that Mr. Trump long held against him. But the two have worked to repair the relationship in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "One reporter noted their relationship has had its ups and downs.",
      "\"I think it's mostly ups,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",

    "summary": "China says it will counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust probe into Google and other trade measures.",
    "story": [
      "China said Tuesday it would counter President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products with tariffs of its own on multiple U.S. imports. It also announced an antitrust investigation into Google and other trade measures aimed at the U.S., ratcheting up trade tensions between the two economic heavyweights.",
      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",
      "Google didn't immediately comment.",
      "Mr. Trump paused his plans Monday to\u00a0implement steep tariffs\u00a0on imports from Mexico and Canada for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others. So ... they could put some significant harm on our economy,\" said Philip Luck, a former State Department official and director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Monday at a forum.",
      "The response from China appears calculated and measured, said Stephen Dover, chief market strategist and head of the Franklin Templeton Institute.",
      "\"I don't think they want the trade war escalating,\" he said. \"And they see (the) example from Canada and Mexico and probably they are hoping for the same thing.\"",
      "But, he adds, \"A risk is that this is the beginning of a tit-for-tat trade war, which could result in lower GDP growth everywhere, higher U.S. inflation, a stronger dollar and upside pressure on U.S. interest rates,\" Dover said.",

      "Vance has proven to be essential in getting President Trump's most controversial cabinet nominees cleared through committees to a full Senate confirmation vote. Multiple Republican senators who were on the fence about supporting some of the president's picks have said it was Vance, their former Senate colleague, who helped them get them to yes on some of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.",

And I worked with Vice President Vance, and he got me those the requested answers,\" Young told reporters.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, another prolific swing vote, has also complimented Vance and said she has spoken with him about policy.",
      "\"I think all of us who have served with JD have had conversations with him,\" she said. \"I've talked to him, for example, about the difference between our relationships with Canada, which is very important in my state, versus our relationship with Mexico and China.\"",
      "Vance introduced commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick at his confirmation hearing last month. And when it came to Trump's embattled nominee for defense secretary, Vance not only ginned up support for Pete Hegseth but also cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm him.",
      "Vance is particularly close to Senate Majority Whip John Barasso, who is responsible for counting votes and is considered an integral part of the team. While he only served in the Senate for two years before becoming vice president, Vance built key relationships in the chamber, and Republicans members view him a trusted colleague. He has been working the phones and talking to senators about their questions and concerns.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk's control of a federal payment system is raising concerns about funding for programs like Social Security and the safety of personal data.",
    "story": [
      "With Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gaining control of the Treasury Department's payment system, consumer advocates and Democratic lawmakers are raising alarms about the group's access to the federal government's financial spigot, as well as sensitive data such as the Social Security numbers of most taxpayers.",
      "DOGE, a Trump administration task force assigned to find ways to reduce federal spending, now has access to a Treasury unit called the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which disburses trillions in payments each year, including Social Security checks and federal salaries, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Musk's access to the payment system is raising concerns as it comes just days after the White House ordered a broad freeze\u00a0on federal grants and loans, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. That same day, state Medicaid programs said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "While the White House later rescinded the memo and a judge halted the freeze, DOGE's control of the Treasury's payment system raises questions about the Trump administration's ability to halt the flow of federal funds for programs including Medicare and Social Security. It's also causing concerns about DOGE's access to the personal and financial information of most taxpayers.",
      "\"There's no community of Americans that this system does not touch, and so I think the concern is that access to this system including personally identifiable information has been ceded to the president's billionaire friend for reasons that are passing understanding,\" Donald K. Sherman, executive director and chief counsel of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There are \"quite real risks\" that DOGE \"could potentially undermine that system and threaten millions of Americans from getting payments that they are due,\" he added.",
      "Musk's access to the Treasury payment system has sparked concern from Democratic lawmakers including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden, while a lawsuit was filed on Monday alleging \"unlawful ongoing, systematic, and continuous disclosure of personal and financial information\" to Musk and DOGE. The lawsuit, filed by two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, names U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and the Treasury as defendants.",
      "\"Controlling the system could allow the Trump Administration to 'unilaterally' \u2014 and illegally \u2014 cut off payments for millions of Americans, putting at risk the financial security of families and businesses based on political favoritism or the whims of Mr. Musk and those on his team who have worked their way inside,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, in a Feb. 2 letter to Bessent.",
      "She added, \"It could also give them access to millions of Americans' personal and financial information that is protected by law.\"",
      "The Treasury Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "However, CBS News obtained a letter sent from Jonathan Blum, a legislative affairs official with the Treasury Department, to members of Congress Tuesday, which claimed that DOGE will only have \"read-only\" access to the department's data.",
      "The letter stated that Tom Krause, a member of Musk's DOGE team who has been brought in as a Treasury Department employee, will \"have read-only access to the coded data of the Fiscal Service's payment systems\" as part of an \"operational efficiency assessment.\"",
      "\"This is similar to the kind of access that Treasury provides to individuals reviewing Treasury systems, such as auditors, and that follows practices associated with protecting the integrity of the systems and business processes,\" the letter read, describing Krause as a \"longtime technology executive.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.",
      "What is the Bureau of the Fiscal Service?",
      "The Treasury has long been the federal government's checkbook, tasked with handling payments for individual agencies based on funds appropriated by Congress. Its systems control the flow of over $6 trillion in payments to American families, businesses and other recipients each year.",
      "The Treasury Department's Bureau of the Fiscal Service handles most of those payments. About 90 cents of every $1 in federal payments are sent through the little-known division.",
      "In fiscal 2023, the unit disbursed nearly 1.3 billion payments totaling $5.4 trillion, according\u00a0to\u00a0the agency. Almost 97% of the payments were made electronically and all were made on time, it noted.",
      "How did DOGE get control of the payment system?",
      "The executive\u00a0order\u00a0signed by President Trump that created DOGE directed all agencies to make sure it was given \"full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems and IT systems.\" DOGE itself is not a federal department.",
      "Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla, gained control of the system after Treasury's acting Deputy Secretary, David Lebryk, resigned from his position after more than 30 years of service. Lebryk stepped down after Musk and his DOGE organization requested access to sensitive Treasury data, the Washington Post had reported.",
      "On Sunday, Musk\u00a0stated\u00a0that DOGE had stopped payments from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services to Lutheran Family Services, a faith-based charity that had been offering social services to refugees.",
      "Could this impact Social Security?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are raising concerns about the potential impact on government programs including Social Security, although neither Musk nor Mr. Trump have flagged Social Security as a target for cuts.",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump has said he will preserve Social Security, and while on the campaign trail he vowed to eliminate taxes on Social Security Income. But because the Bureau of the Fiscal Services sends monthly checks to more than 70 million Social Security beneficiaries, some advocates say they're worried.",
      "Musk and DOGE \"now have access to the personal information of every Social Security beneficiary \u2014 and the ability to stop payments for any federal programs they dislike,\" said Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the programs, in an email. \"Seniors, their families, and people with disabilities most certainly cannot trust Trump and Musk with their crucial federal benefits \u2014 or their personal data.\"",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a Jan. 31 letter to Bessent that he's concerned that Social Security checks could be impacted, \"whether intentional or unintentional.\"",
      "\"It appears that Musk's behavior is forcing out highly qualified and experienced career public servants in order to get his way and fulfill Trump's goal of eviscerating the federal budget, including potentially by cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits for millions of Americans who are already struggling to pay their bills or buy groceries,\" he wrote.",
      "Does Musk have access to taxpayers' personal data?",
      "Lawmakers and consumer advocates are also raising concerns about DOGE's access to personal data for millions of American taxpayers. Because the Bureau of the Fiscal Service distributes tax refunds and Social Security payments, it has access to the Social Security numbers and bank accounts of recipients.",
      "Kate Miller, who serves on an advisory board for DOGE, didn't respond to requests for comment but did\u00a0repost an Associated Press article on X\u00a0with the comment, \"No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances.\"",
      "Access to that personal information could pose risks to taxpayers, according to data safety experts.",
      "\"Traditionally, access to this information has been highly restricted and among the most secure information the U.S. government holds,\" said James E. Lee, the president of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"This is the kind of information that, if it found its way into the hands of a bad actor, could lead to a wide range of identity crimes \u2014 impersonation to open new accounts or access existing ones, theft of the funds in an existing banking account, applying for new state or federal government benefits, and filing false tax returns among other forms of identity fraud.\"",
      "The data is also sensitive because it could be useful to intelligence agencies in other nations, including the personal data of government employees or ties that businesses have with the U.S. government, Lee noted.",
      "That concern was echoed by Sen. Wyden, who in the Jan. 31 letter to Bessent questioned granting access to sensitive information to Musk due to significant business interests in China, noting that Tesla operates its largest factory in China. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 18:47:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, recording as many 1,000 arrests on some days.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is releasing some migrant detainees, in some cases dozens per day, as space in its detention system has exceeded maximum capacity amid a spike in arrests by the agency under President Trump, internal government statistics obtained by CBS News show.",
      "On Tuesday morning, space inside ICE detention facilities was at 109% capacity, with the agency holding close to 42,000 migrant detainees, despite having, on paper, a 38,521-bed capacity in its network of for-profit prisons and county jails, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security data. More than half of those in ICE custody were initially arrested along the southern border, the figures show.",
      "On Monday, ICE released roughly 160 migrants from its custody, the figures show, an indication that the Trump administration, faced with the same operational and legal challenges on immigration enforcement that have bedeviled Democratic and Republican presidents, is being forced to release some detainees. Those released can be fitted by ICE with ankle monitors, to track their movements.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, ICE acknowledged that its \"enhanced\" operations have yielded \"a significant number of arrests of criminal aliens that require greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"We are exploring every solution including working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and our state and local law enforcement partners, asking Congress for increased funding, and scrutinizing case files to quickly remove criminal aliens with executable final orders of removal from Department of Justice immigration judges,\" the agency said.",
      "ICE also said some immigration laws require it to release certain migrants, noting that those released remain under the agency's supervision.",
      "Earlier this week, NBC News reported ICE had released some migrants recently arrested under the Trump administration.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, ICE has increased arrest operations across the country, recording as many 1,000 arrests on some days, compared to the 312 daily average during former President Joe Biden's last year in office. The Trump administration has rescinded several Biden-era limits on ICE arrests, giving the agency a broad mandate to go after most of those in the U.S. illegally, including unauthorized migrants without criminal records.",
      "But those arrested by ICE often have to be detained for days and weeks \u2014 and in some cases, months \u2014 before the agency completes all the paperwork and legal process necessary to deport them. Sometimes, those migrants can't be deported because their home countries do not accept them, and the Supreme Court has limited detention in those cases. In other cases, judges grant them relief from deportation.",
      "Because of the limited space at existing holding facilities, ICE is planning to dramatically expand its detention capacity as it seeks to fulfill what Mr. Trump has promised will be the largest mass deportation campaign in U.S. history.",
      "On one hand, the agency is seeking to expand its own network of detention centers. An internal government memo last month indicated that ICE was eyeing 14 new detention sites that could hold as many as 1,000 detainees each, as well as four larger facilities with 10,000 beds each.",
      "But ICE is also turning to other agencies to augment its detention capabilities. The Department of Defense has already authorized ICE to detain migrants at a Space Force base in Colorado, and the Guantanamo Bay Naval base received its first group of migrant detainees on Tuesday after Mr. Trump directed officials to convert facilities there into a massive immigration detention center.",
      "Over the weekend, Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, asked county sheriffs to help federal immigration officers arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants, Reuters reported.",
      "The Trump administration has also considered holding ICE detainees inside large tent sites, known as \"soft-sided\" facilities, that were set up by Border Patrol along the southern border to temporarily house and process migrant families and children, two officials familiar with the proposal told CBS News.",
      "It's unclear whether that plan will be implemented. It could face significant operational and safety challenges as soft-sided facilities were designed for short-term processing and are not as secure as ICE detention centers.",
      "But, unlike ICE, Border Patrol's detention space is well under capacity. On Tuesday morning, Customs and Border Protection had fewer than 2,000 migrants in its custody, using roughly 9% of its 21,000-person detention capacity, according to the internal DHS data.",
      "That is mainly due to the relative calm at the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings are nearing a five-year low. In January, Border Patrol processed nearly 30,000 migrants who crossed the southern border illegally, the lowest level since May 2020, internal government figures show.",

      "Two groups of anonymous FBI agents who worked on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot investigation and other federal probes tied to President Trump are suing the federal government over the Justice Department's plans to review the FBI's workforce and scrutinize agents who may have worked on the sensitive investigations, according to two separate lawsuits filed monday.",
      "The agents and the FBI Agents Association \u2014 an organization that represents thousands of current and former agents \u2014 are suing the Justice Department and its interim head, Acting Attorney General James McHenry, to prevent the public release of the names of the agents facing scrutiny.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuits are the latest salvo in an ongoing rift between career FBI employees and Justice Department leadership over the Trump administration's potential personnel changes within the bureau.",
      "On Friday, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 investigation \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In response, on Sunday, agents across the country were asked to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "According to a U.S. official familiar with the process, the FBI subsequently turned over the requested agent and personnel information to Justice Department leadership on Tuesday afternoon. Information like employee ID numbers and titles of 5,000 individuals were on the list, the official said.",
      "There is no indication yet about what actions the Justice Department may take against anyone on the compiled lists and so far, a handful of senior career officials have been fired, while rank-and-file agents remain on the job.",
      "The nine unnamed FBI agents who filed the first lawsuit on Tuesday alleged, \"The purpose for this list is to identify agents to be terminated or to suffer other adverse employment action.\"",
      "Their attorneys asked for a jury trial and wrote that the agents feared \"this list might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution.\"",
      "The second group of agents and the FBI Agents Association alleged social media activity indicated some charged during the Jan. 6 probe who have since been pardoned by the president, \"link to each other in posts promoting violence and insurrection against law enforcement agents.\"",
      "The Justice Department has not \"made any reasonable efforts to ensure that the maintenance and public release of the records at issue in this case are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for agency purposes,\" the lawsuit said, adding later, \"This bell cannot be unrung, and once the Plaintiffs' personal information is released it will be eternally available on social media.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "McHenry also recently instructed the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., to fire certain prosecutors who had been\u00a0 assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a separate memo dated Jan. 31, and reviewed by CBS News. That decision, which mostly affected contract lawyers brought in on an interim basis to prosecute Jan. 6 cases, is not subject to the new lawsuit.",
      "And last week, eight executives at FBI headquarters and the heads of various field offices including in Washington, D.C., were forced to resign, retire or face termination.",
      "James Dennehy, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office, wrote in a memo to 1,200 agents and support personnel on Friday: \"Today we find ourselves in the middle of a battle of our own as good people are being walked out of the FBI and others are being targeted because they did their jobs in accordance with the law and FBI policy.\"",
      "The personnel moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Soon after taking office, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. government is moving quickly to implement President Trump's order to turn facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base into a large-scale immigration detention center, sending the first group of migrant detainees there on Tuesday.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to dramatically expand detention space inside the naval base to detain as many as 30,000 \"high-priority\" unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Since then, officials from across the government, including the Departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, have scrambled to implement the president's directive.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a plane carrying 10 migrant detainees departed the Fort Bliss Army base near the Texas border for Guantanamo Bay, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. Two officials said the migrants were classified as \"high-threat\" detainees who would be held in cells inside the naval base. One of the officials said they were Venezuelan men with affiliations to Tren De Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela's prisons.",
      "A U.S. official said those likely to be sent to the naval base in the future would be unauthorized immigrants arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the agency at the center of the president's vow to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history. The agency has ramped up immigration operations across the country under Mr. Trump, averaging between 800 and 1,000 daily arrests in the past week \u2014 up from the 312 average in former President Joe Biden's final year in office.",
      "Over the past several days, there has been an internal debate about whether the Pentagon or DHS would have legal and physical custody over the migrant detainees, and what sort of legal rights they would have.",
      "For decades, the Guantanamo base has included a facility, known as the Migrant Operations Center, where U.S. immigration officials have screened some asylum-seekers intercepted at sea. That area is separate from Guantanamo Bay's detention center, the post-9/11 military prison where the U.S. still holds more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "A relatively small number of migrants are housed in barrack-like facilities while they undergo interviews with asylum officers. Asylum-seekers who passed those initial interviews have been referred for resettlement in third countries like Australia and Canada. The U.S. has long had a policy of not allowing those caught at sea to seek asylum in the U.S. in order to deter maritime migration.",

    "summary": "A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that challenges President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The suit\u00a0was filed in federal district court in Maryland on behalf of two 12 year-olds who identify as transgender and five transgender teenagers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, along with LGBTQ advocacy groups. They allege that Mr. Trump's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status.",
      "\"The Executive Orders were issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of preventing transgender people from expressing a gender identity different from their sex designated at birth \u2014 and expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people who, by definition, have a gender identity that does not align with their sex designated at birth,\" lawyers for the families wrote in their complaint.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure follows executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to promote gender ideology and declares U.S. policy as recognizing two sexes, male and female.",
      "Half of the states have in recent years passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July. The Trump administration is likely to reverse the government's position in the case.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the seven transgender individuals argues that Mr. Trump's executive orders involving gender identity are unlawful and unconstitutional because he is usurping Congress' authority by unilaterally seeking to withhold funding from medical institutions, providers and researchers that have already received congressional approval.",
      "\"Under our Constitution, it is Congress, not the president, who is vested with the power of the purse,\" they argued in their filing. \"The president does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously authorized by Congress and signed into law, and the president does not have the power to impose his own conditions on the use of funds when Congress has not delegated to him the power to do so.\"",
      "The challengers warn that Mr. Trump's directive to cut off federal funding for medical providers that offer gender-affirming care has already had \"concrete and immediate effects.\" In one instance, Children's National based in Washington, D.C., announced last week \u2014 on the heels of the president's order \u2014 that it would be pausing its provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth.",
      "In another instance, one of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old from Virginia identified in filings as W.G., was set to continue receiving hormone therapy from doctors at Virginia Commonwealth University Health and Children's Hospital, but had her appointment canceled. The hospital receives more than $100 million in federal grants, according to the complaint, and announced it would be suspending gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 19 in response to Mr. Trump's order.",
      "NYU Langone Health in New York City, which received more than $5.6 million in federal grants over the last 12 months, treats several of the transgender youth involved in the lawsuit but canceled planned procedures for two of them, according to the filing.",
      "\"By directing agencies to withhold all federal funding from entities that 'promote gender ideology' and provide gender affirming medical care to patients under nineteen, the Gender Identity and Denial of Care Orders threaten the ability of medical institutions and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to provide essential health care to their communities, train the next generation of physicians, and support research to address this country's greatest health challenges,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote.",
      "They are asking the court to declare Mr. Trump's orders are unlawful and block their enforcement.",
      "The president has issued a slew of executive orders in his first weeks back in the White House covering a wide range of issues, from immigration to energy to gender identity. Many have already been the subject of court challenges, and more are expected as federal agencies begin taking steps to implement Mr. Trump's directives.",

      "Republicans on the panel who were seen as potential \"no\" votes began to drop their objections Monday, with Sen. Susan Collins of Maine saying that Gabbard had addressed her concerns and shared her vision of downsizing the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana announced Tuesday he would back Gabbard after he secured \"commitments that will advance our national security.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's choice to lead the intelligence community was seen as one of the most vulnerable nominees heading into her confirmation hearing on Jan. 30, when she was grilled on a number of controversial positions she has taken over the years. She faced skepticism from senators over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her comments about Russia's war in Ukraine and her past opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
      "The most contentious moments of the hearing came as she was repeatedly pressed by Republican and Democratic senators on whether she would characterize Snowden as a \"traitor.\"",
      "Gabbard declined to directly answer the question, responding each time that \"Edward Snowden broke the law.\" She never said that he was a \"traitor\" and at one point seemed to defend his actions, telling the panel that he had exposed \"egregious illegal and unconstitutional programs\" that led to reforms. During the 2020 presidential campaign, Gabbard vowed to pardon Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and later Russia, where he lives in exile, after the leak.",
      "\"I do not agree with or support all of the information and intelligence that he released, nor the way in which he did it,\" Gabbard told senators.",
      "Gabbard also sought to alleviate concerns about her criticisms of FISA Section 702, which allows the U.S. to collect foreign communications without a warrant. U.S. officials say it's crucial to protecting national security because it helps disrupt terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and espionage activities. It does not allow U.S. citizens to be targeted, but their communications can be swept up when they are in contact with a targeted foreigner.",
      "Gabbard told senators during her confirmation hearing last week it was \"essential\" to national security, years after she tried to repeal the controversial law.",
      "\"There are a number of areas that we would be blind from a national security perspective without this capability,\" she said. \"It also must exist next to having safeguards in place to ensure Americans' civil liberties are protected.\"",
      "The former congresswoman from Hawaii has also faced criticism for her comments about the war in Ukraine and meeting with Assad, then doubting that his regime used chemical weapons against civilians.",
      "At her hearing, Gabbard conceded that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"started the war in Ukraine\" and that her skepticism of the chemical weapons attack was based on \"conflicting information and evidence\" that she was given at the time.",

      "\"We must take care of our brave men and women in uniform, and Doug will be a great advocate for our active duty servicemembers, veterans, and military families to ensure they have the support they need,\" Mr. Trump said in a November statement announcing Collins' nomination.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs manages a more than $350 billion budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals nationwide. It also manages national cemeteries and works closely with the Defense Department on personnel matters.",
      "Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans.",

Collins said that he understand the challenges facing veterans today who \"went time and time again, deployment after deployment\" to conflict zones.",
      "Collins served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. He has been an outspoken conservative since his time in the Georgia state legislature and was a close Trump ally during the president's first term. He ran for Senate in 2020 but lost the Republican primary to Kelly Loeffler, a major GOP donor who Trump has tapped to lead the U.S. Small Business Association.",

    "summary": "The Senate Finance Committee advanced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee advanced Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination Tuesday, moving forward with his confirmation to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after a pair of fiery hearings last week that left his approval on shaky ground.",
      "The committee voted 14 to 13 to advance Kennedy in a party-line vote.",
      "Though the bulk of Republicans on the committee were expected to support advancing Kennedy's nomination, Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and medical doctor, expressed concern over the president's pick for HHS secretary during RFK Jr.'s confirmation hearings.",
      "Cassidy said last week that he had been \"struggling\" with Kennedy's nomination because he fears RFK Jr., who has raised doubts about vaccines in the past, could undermine faith in vaccines. Cassidy spoke to Kennedy on Sunday, according to a person familiar with their conversation, though the Louisiana senator did not disclose how he planned to vote following their conversation.",
      "But Cassidy, who is up for reelection in 2026, ultimately opted to support advancing Kennedy's nomination on Tuesday.",
      "Moments ahead of the vote, Cassidy announced that he would support Kennedy in a post on X, saying he had \"very intense conversations with Bobby and the White House over the weekend and even this morning,\" while thanking Vice President JD Vance for his \"honest counsel.\"",
      "\"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Kennedy appeared before the finance committee for a confirmation hearing last week, before testifying to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions the following day. During both appearances, Democrats on the committees \u2014 and even some Republicans \u2014 grilled the longtime environmental lawyer and activist on his stances on vaccines, abortion, and other issues.",
      "President Trump's pick for HHS secretary has faced scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans, alike. Though Kennedy, 71, initially sought the Democratic presidential nomination and has close ties to the party as the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy, he dropped out of the presidential race to endorse Mr. Trump in August, and has long been the recipient of the Democratic establishment's ire.",
      "Amid the pushback, some had looked to possible support from Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent. But Sanders said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that he was \"not particularly happy\" with Kennedy's presentation before the Senate committees last week.",
      "Without support from Democrats on the committee, which has a one-member GOP advantage, Cassidy's opposition threatened to tank a favorable recommendation for advancing Kennedy's nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, two Democrats on the committee, Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, raised alarm about possible conflicts of interest in recent days, penning a letter to Kennedy concerning his potential to profit from vaccine-related litigation. Paired with his long-held stances on vaccine safety, the senators said the possible conflicts give them \"grave concern\" about his ability to serve as HHS secretary.",
      "Kennedy has earned referral fees from a Los Angeles personal injury law firm, Wisner Baum, for years. The firm is currently suing Merck concerning warnings about the safety of the HPV vaccine. Kennedy agreed to divest his interests in the cases he has referred to Wisner Baum to a \"non-dependent, adult family member.\" The senators noted in their letter that Kennedy in his written response to committee questions indicated he was divesting the interest to one of his adult sons \u2014 a detail which they called \"troubling.\"",
      "\"The arrangement outlined in your Ethics Agreement Amendment is plainly inadequate, as it would appear to allow an immediate family member to benefit financially from your position as Secretary,\" the senators wrote, adding that \"vaccine-related decisions\" that Kennedy could make as HHS secretary \"could result in significant financial compensation for your family.\"",
      "The Democrats also asked Kennedy to commit in writing to recuse himself from all vaccine-related communications and decisions and pledge not to litigate cases involving vaccines or have a financial interest in the cases for at least four years after leaving office. Kennedy said during Wednesday's hearing that he would \"comply with all the ethical guidelines.\"",
      "With the advancement out of committee, the fight over Kennedy's confirmation will move to the Senate floor, where his approval isn't guaranteed. Republicans can afford to lose just three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.",
      "The developments come as Senate Republicans have pushed to quickly confirm Mr. Trump's nominees to his Cabinet and top administration posts, with appointees like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sailing to confirmation, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth eked by with a 51-50 vote on his confirmation.",
      "The president decried pushback from Democrats regarding his nominees in a post on Truth Social Sunday, saying \"no matter how good and well qualified someone is, they are taking maximum time for approval \u2014 and laughing about it.\"",
      "\"Republicans must GET TOUGH \u2014 AND MUST GET TOUGH VERY FAST,\" Trump said. \"We need our Nominees NOW, for the Safety and Good of our Country!\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 09:52:32 -0500",
    "summary": "After meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, El Salvador's president has offered to house U.S. deportees and even American inmates in his country's \"mega-prison.\"",
    "story": [
      "San Salvador, El Salvador \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept and incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including criminals with American citizenship currently imprisoned in the U.S. President Nayib Bukele confirmed the offer in a social media post, saying El Salvador was willing to rehouse deportees and American prisoners in a two-year-old \"mega-prison\" he had built as potent symbol of his crackdown on criminal gangs.",
      "Bukele \"has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\" Rubio said after meeting the Salvadoran leader at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said of migrants of all nationalities detained in the United States. \"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "Bukele confirmed the offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.\"",
      "He said his country would accept only \"only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee\" that he said \"would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire working with Mr. Trump to remake the federal government, responded on his X platform, \"Great idea!!\"",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens, and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "CBS News reported\u00a0last month that El Salvador had agreed to accept U.S. deportations of \"criminal illegal migrants from any country,\" including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet President Trump's demands for a major crackdown on\u00a0immigration.",
      "The State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as \"harsh and dangerous.\" On its current country information webpage it says, \"In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.\"",
      "Unlike many of the country's prisons, however, the massive facility known as CECOT that Bukele referred to after his talks with Rubio remains more than half-empty, according to the French news agency AFP, with capacity for 40,000 inmates but only about 15,000 currently estimated to be incarcerated there.",
      "Formally called the Terrorism Confinement Center, CECOT is surrounded by high concrete walls and it sits on the edge of a jungle about 45 miles southeast of San Salvador. According to AFP, inmates at the prison are only permitted to leave their cells for court hearings, which are conducted via video link, or for 30 minutes of daily exercise in an enclosed hall.",
      "Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. His tour is taking place at a time of turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency.",
      "The Trump administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \"safe third country\" agreement. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \"safe third country\" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington's \"backyard to dump the garbage.\"",
      "After meeting with Bukele, Rubio signed a memorandum of understanding with his Salvadoran counterpart to advance U.S.-El Salvador civil nuclear cooperation. The document could lead to a more formal deal on cooperation in nuclear power and medicine that the U.S. has with numerous countries.",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it's not good for anyone.\"",
      "Monday's deportation flight came as Mr. Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after Musk announced Mr. Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades - although its new status will likely be challenged in court - and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Mr. Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Mr. Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\"I understand that it's a delicate issue in Panama,\" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \"We don't want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\" he said. \"I don't believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it'll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\"",
      "But back in Washington, Mr. Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long and that's the way it has to be.\"",
      "\"We either want it back, or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And China will be dealt with.\"",

      "The Education Department said in a news release that investigations respond to the \"explosion of antisemitism on American campuses following the Hamas massacre of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023.\" It cited Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which protects individuals from discrimination based on national origin and applies to schools and institutions of higher learning that receive federal funding.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order last week calling for aggressive action against antisemitism on college campuses, vowing to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be \"Hamas sympathizers.\" The order drew criticism from civil rights groups, who said the protests were mostly peaceful, included students of all backgrounds, including Jewish students, and that the president's directive violates the First Amendment.",
      "The department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, accused the Biden administration of failing to hold institutions responsible for tolerating \"widespread antisemitic harassment and the illegal encampments that paralyzed campus life last year.\"",

      "At\u00a0Berkeley, as has been the case at a number of universities, protesters have demanded the university divest from Israel and an end to the war in Gaza.",
      "Tensions have remained high at Columbia University over the Israel-Hamas war and the school's response to protests on campus that have been taking place since early last year. At the end of last year's term, the NYPD disbanded an encampment on the quad and dozens of student protesters were arrested. Columbia would end up canceling its graduation ceremony.",
      "Presidents of Columbia and Northwestern were among those called to testify on Capitol Hill last year as Republicans sought accountability for allegations of antisemitism. Several university presidents, including\u00a0Columbia's Minoche Shafik, resigned amid criticism of their handling of the protests.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Chicago, Northwestern said it had taken several actions to address antisemitism on campus, including updating its student code of conduct and its disciplinary procedures.",
      "\"There is no place for antisemitism or any form of identity-based discrimination or hate at Northwestern University,\" the school said in its statement. \"Free expression and academic freedom are among our core values, but we have made clear that these values provide no excuse for behavior that threatens the well-being of others.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former USAID Global Health director  Dr. Atul Gawande criticized the Trump administration's plan to merge the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department and the funding freezes that are putting key aid programs in jeopardy. Asked about the changes, he said, \"It's not an overhaul. It's a destruction.\"",
      "Gawande, a surgeon, medical professor and best-selling author, told CBS News on Monday that the \"destruction\" began a week ago after the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance. The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but programs appear to still be halted or in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status [of USAID] is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",
      "Other former USAID workers expressed similar concerns.",
      "Maura Reap, who was a USAID contractor with the Bureau for Global Health until last week, had just arrived on a two-week assignment in Ethiopia when Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0ordered a pause\u00a0on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. During the first week of the assignment, Reap was supposed to be focused on designing a project supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Reap, whose expertise is in mental health, said the program had been planned for months.",
      "\"We had some meetings over the weekend, and there was just a lot of uncertainty,\" Reap said in an interview with CBS News. \"It was like a slow train wreck.\"",
      "Eventually, she got an email saying she had to return to Washington, D.C. While she was in the air, she and her two colleagues had received termination notices.",
      "\"This terrible waste of a [temporary duty travel] with all the planning and investment that had gone into it, and it was for nothing,\" she said.",
      "Gawande also hit back at Mr. Trump and\u00a0billionaire Elon Musk's comments, who have both slammed the agency, with Mr. Trump recently saying the USAID is \"run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\" Musk said the agency \"is not an apple with a worm in it, what we have actually, just a ball of worms.\"",
      "Gawande countered, \"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to cut the size of the federal government, and USAID has been a recent target of his and Musk's, who is tasked with leading the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Earlier Monday, the White House released a list of examples of what it deemed wasteful spending by USAID in recent years. Democratic lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Reap expressed dismay that \"somebody who's not even elected can come in and just take this 60-year-old institution that has accomplished so much ... and to have so much disregard and to take it and to turn it and to throw it on his back and to say, this is not \u2014 this is, we're throwing it out.\"",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger?\" Gawande said.",
      "Reap also argued that the work USAID does saves lives and supports policies that benefit the United States.",
      "\"Because, I mean, there's so many things related to the work we do,\" Reap said. \"Stopping outbreaks, reducing the push and pull factors for migration at our southern \u2014 at our borders. The work we do counters extremism, and it leads \u2014 it contributes to stable communities by the work we're doing by keeping people healthy so they can contribute to their communities.\"",
      "Gawande noted, \"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process. There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",

      "The Senate on Monday confirmed fossil fuel executive Chris Wright to serve as energy secretary, a key post to promote President Trump's efforts to achieve U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market.",
      "Wright, CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, has been one of the industry's loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He says more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe and has promised to help Mr. Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\"",
      "The Senate approved his nomination, 59-38.",
      "The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill,\" and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats' \"green new scam\" in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal that emit planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "\"President Trump shares my passion for energy,\" Wright said at his confirmation hearing last month, promising that if confirmed, he would \"work tirelessly to implement [Mr. Trump's] bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\"",
      "That includes oil and natural gas, coal, nuclear power and hydropower, along with wind and solar power and geothermal energy, Wright said.",
      "Mr. Trump's energy wishes are likely to run into real-world limits, including the fact that U.S. oil production is already at record levels. The federal government cannot force companies to drill for more oil, and production increases could lower prices and reduce profits.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican, called Wright an innovator who \"tells the truth about energy production.\"",
      "While Wright \"acknowledges that climate change is real, he knows more American energy is the solution \u2014 not the problem,'' Barrasso said, calling Wright's \"energy realism\" welcome news.",

      "Sen. Michael Bennet called Wright a successful Colorado entrepreneur with deep expertise in energy innovation and technology. He pledged to work with Wright to \"ensure Colorado continues to lead the country in energy production and innovation.\"",
      "While acknowledging that climate change is real, Wright said at his hearing that he believes \"there isn't dirty energy or clean energy.\" Rather, he said, there are different sources of energy with different tradeoffs.",
      "Wright, 60, has been chair\u00a0and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no prior experience in government. He grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",

      "As energy secretary, Wright will join Interior Secretary Doug Burgum as a key player on energy policy. Both will serve on a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The panel will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \"cutting red tape\" and boosting domestic energy production, Mr. Trump said. The council's mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by former President Joe Biden, who made fighting climate change a top priority.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday ordered the Trump administration to temporarily stop its freeze on federal assistance, allowing aid to continue flowing to nonprofit organizations and other entities after the funding was targeted by the White House budget office last week.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan of the federal district court in Washington, D.C., formally granted the request from a coalition of nonprofits that had challenged the directive from the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB. She said the administration's actions \"run roughshod over a 'bulwark of the Constitution' by interfering with Congress's appropriation of funds.\"",
      "Issued nearly one week ago, the OMB memo directed all agencies to temporarily pause all federal assistance that may be implicated by certain executive orders issued by President Trump in his first days in office.",
      "While OMB acting Director Matthew Vaeth rescinded the memo after it led to widespread confusion as to which entities would be affected by the funding freeze, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pause on federal assistance would remain in place and just the memo was being revoked.",
      "In a 30-page opinion granting the challengers' request to block the funding freeze, AliKhan wrote that a review of the programs that should or should not receive federal dollars \"could be conducted without depriving millions of Americans access to vital resources.\"",
      "She notes that the administration's memo potentially covered up to $3 trillion in financial assistance, a \"breathtakingly large sum of money to suspend practically overnight.\"",
      "\"Rather than taking a measured approach to identify purportedly wasteful spending, defendants cut the fuel supply to a vast, complicated, nationwide machine \u2014 seemingly without any consideration for the consequences of that decision,\" AliKhan, who was nominated for her current seat by former President Biden in 2023, wrote.",
      "The judge also cited Leavitt's statements, writing that \"OMB and the various agencies it communicates with appear committed to restricting federal funding.\"",
      "\"By rescinding the memorandum that announced the freeze, but 'NOT . . . the federal funding freeze; itself, it appears that OMB sought to overcome a judicially imposed obstacle without actually ceasing the challenged conduct. The court can think of few things more disingenuous,\" she wrote, quoting a social media post from the White House press secretary.",
      "The initial memo from Vaeth brought on legal challenges from the nonprofit groups in Washington and from 22 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, which was filed in Rhode Island. The federal judge overseeing the states' case temporarily blocked the Trump administration from freezing federal assistance Friday after concluding that OMB's actions were likely unlawful.",
      "AliKhan's decision came just before an earlier order that temporarily halted the freeze and maintained the status quo was set to expire at 5 p.m. Monday. She held a hearing earlier in the day to consider the request from the nonprofits to issue a temporary restraining order and suggested then that she would grant their motion.",
      "AliKhan had warned that the harm to groups that receive federal assistance could be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "The White House budget office's directive targeting federal assistance is one of several measures taken by the new Trump administration that have upended the federal government. Mr. Trump has pledged to shrink the federal workforce and spending and tapped billionaire Elon Musk to oversee those efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency, which the president established on his first day back in the White House.",
      "Since then, the Trump administration paused new funding for nearly all foreign aid and has targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development for a potential reorganization.",
      "The moves from the Trump administration pausing the flow of federal assistance have left organizations in the U.S. and abroad reeling. Domestically, groups that provide meals to the elderly and school-aged children, universities and small businesses were left scrambling to determine whether they would lose access to funding that has already been approved by Congress. Overseas, humanitarian and development groups that receive assistance from the State Department or USAID were forced to furlough workers.",

      "Human brains contain higher concentrations of microplastics than other organs, according to a new study, and the amount appears to be increasing over time.",
      "In the study, published Monday in the journal\u00a0Nature Medicine, University of New Mexico Health Sciences researchers found microplastics in human brains have increased 50% over the past 8 years. They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",
      "The lead researcher, toxicologist Matthew Campen, said the rate of accumulation they found mirrors the increasing amounts of plastics waste on the planet. And he said in the news release that their findings should trigger alarm about the potential impact on human health.",
      "\"I have yet to encounter a single human being who says, 'There's a bunch of plastic in my brain and I'm totally cool with that,'\" he said.",
      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",
      "Campen suspects most microplastics in the body are ingested through food, particularly meat.",
      "\"The way we irrigate fields with plastic-contaminated water, we postulate that the plastics build up there,\" he said. \"We feed those crops to our livestock. We take the manure and put it back on the field, so there may be a sort of feed-forward biomagnification.\"",
      "The team also found high concentrations of plastic in meat bought at grocery stores.",
      "As for the higher levels found in the brains of dementia patients, the researchers noted the study was not designed to prove whether that was the cause of symptoms \u2014 it may be the reverse, that the disease process allows more accumulation to happen.",

      "Starliner astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore took a stroll outside the International Space Station on Thursday, marking their 239th day in orbit by carrying out a task originally planned for a spacewalk last summer. In the process, Williams became the world's most experienced female spacewalker, logging more than 62 hours outside the lab over nine excursions across multiple missions.",
      "Her latest outing began at 7:43 a.m. EST when she and Wilmore switched their spacesuits to battery power and headed out to retrieve a faulty S-band antenna assembly mounted on an external storage platform. Two earlier attempts to retrieve the unit were unsuccessful.",
      "The device wasn't designed for spacewalk retrieval and it took Williams and Wilmore longer than had been planned to get the job done. But thanks to improvisation and muscle power, the third time was the charm.",
      "\"The team has just been incredible,\" Williams radioed from the Quest airlock when the five-hour 26-minute EVA came to an end. \"I know we were not the first, we weren't even the second crew to do this, but somehow, with all of their great work, we were able to get it done.\"",
      "Added Wilmore: \"This is probably the most involved spacewalk that probably every discipline in the ISS program was sweating as much as Suni and I were. Fantastic job, coming up with the next plan, and the next plan, and the next plan. And it worked! So, outstanding.\"",
      "After the antenna retrieval, Wilmore collected swabs from nearby vents to help researchers determine if any microbial life from inside the station had managed to make it outside and survive in the space environment. A third task, prepping a spare robot arm joint for possible use if arm repairs are ever needed, was deferred to a future spacewalk.",
      "Going into Thursday's spacewalk, or EVA, Williams had logged 56 hours and 40 minutes outside the station during eight previous outings while Wilmore had chalked up 25 hours and 35 minutes of EVA time during four excursions.",
      "With her latest spacewalk, Williams moved past retired astronaut Peggy Whitson's mark of 60 hours and 21 minutes of spacewalk time to become the world's most experienced female spacewalker, moving up to number four overall.",
      "Stuck aboard the station since last June because of NASA concerns about the safety of their Starliner capsule, Williams and Wilmore are now planning to return to Earth around the end of March aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship that carried two other station fliers \u2014 Crew 9 commander Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 to the lab last September.",
      "That Crew Dragon was launched with two empty seats specifically to carry Williams and Wilmore back to Earth at the end of the Crew 9 mission, originally planned for late February. But an extra month was tacked on later to give SpaceX more time to complete pre-flight checks of the Crew 10 Dragon, which will be making its maiden flight.",
      "President Trump earlier this week blamed their long stay in space on the Biden administration and said that he'd asked SpaceX owner Elon Musk to bring Williams and Wilmore back home as soon as possible.",
      "But the astronauts are not stranded. Their ride home has been docked to the station since last September and could bring them back to Earth in short order if NASA so ordered.",
      "But that would cause major disruptions to U.S. research aboard the lab because only a single NASA astronaut \u2014 Don Pettit \u2014 would remain aboard the station with two Russian crewmates until the Crew 10 fliers arrive around the end of March.",

Just four years old at the time, the \"Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code\" was made to help students in nontechnical fields get started with computer programming. One of its attributes was that it used commands, such as GOTO, IF, THEN, and RUN, that made sense to humans. BASIC is what hooked me and made me want to come back.",

Immediately, I learned that the computer was a dumb machine that I had to tell every single step it should take, under every single circumstance that could occur. When I wrote imprecise code, the computer couldn't infer or guess what I meant. I made a lot of errors trying to figure that out. When I finally got it right, the sense of accomplishment far outstripped the result. A game of tic-tac-toe is so simple, even kids learn it quickly. But it felt like a triumph to get a machine to do it.",
      "I loved how the computer forced me to think. It was completely unforgiving in the face of mental sloppiness. It demanded that I be logically consistent and pay attention to details. One misplaced comma or semicolon and the thing wouldn't work.",
      "It reminded me of solving mathematical proofs. Programming doesn't require math skills (beyond the basics), but it does demand the same kind of rigorous, logical approach to problem-solving, breaking problems down into smaller, more manageable parts. And like solving a problem in algebra, there are different ways to write programs that work\u2014some more elegant and efficient than others\u2014but infinite ways to make a program that fails. And mine failed all the time. Only after persevering, forcing myself to think smart, could I coax a program to run flawlessly.",
      "Another early program I wrote was a lunar lander game. The problem: safely touch down a lunar lander on the moon without crashing and before you run out of fuel. From that I had to break the problem down into steps. I had to solve how the game player moved the lander left and right, up and down, how much fuel it had, how fast it burned. I also had to describe what it looked like and how to display the ship in dashes and asterisks on the screen.",
      "Not long after Lakeside installed the terminal, Mr. Stocklin wrote a program that contained an infinite loop, meaning it ran continuously before someone eventually stopped it\u2014but not before it burned through over a hundred dollars of our precious rummage-sale budget. I'm not sure he showed his face again in that room. It was a lesson to all of us.",
      "To avoid racking up charges, I'd write out as much of my program as I could with pen and paper before elbowing into my place at the machine. With the machine offline to avoid time charges, I'd type it in and the program would print on a roll of inch-wide paper tape. That was step one. Then I'd dial the phone\u2014the rotary dial on the side of the terminal\u2014and wait for the buzz of the modem to confirm that I'd connected. I'd then feed my tape in, and chug-chug-chug, the program would input at a blistering ten characters per second. Finally, I'd type \"RUN.\" Typically there was a gaggle of other kids waiting for the computer, so if my program didn't work, I'd have to log off and find a spot to sort through where I went wrong, then wait my turn to get back on the teletype.",
      "This feedback loop was addictive. The feeling of getting better and better was a rush. Writing programs flowed from a combination of skills that came easy to me: logical thinking and an ability to focus intensely for long periods. Programming also stoked the persistent need I had to prove myself.",
      "The atmosphere of that computer room was a (mostly) healthy mix of cooperation and competition. We were a mosh pit of teenage boys all trying to outdo one another. A gap of only two or three years isn't much in the grand scheme of things but feels like a lot when you're thirteen, small for your age, with some indeterminate time until your growth spurt. Kent and I were among the youngest kids in that group. The assumed superiority of some of the older kids bothered us.",
      "I was an eighth-grader confident in my brain power and convinced that my intensity meant I could do anything the older guys could do\u2014if not better, then at least faster. I was determined to not let anyone get anything on me. Kent also hated being put-upon by someone else. Maybe even more than me.",
      "A sophomore named Paul Allen picked this up immediately, and he exploited it beautifully. \"Bill, you think you're so smart, you figure this thing out.\" Those are some of the first words said to me by the person who I would go on to cofound Microsoft with years later.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Pam Bondi as attorney general, installing a key ally of President Trump's to take the helm of the Justice Department.",
      "Bondi's nomination for attorney general was approved by the upper chamber 54 to 46, with one Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joining all Republicans in voting to confirm her. She will take over as the nation's top law enforcement officer as Mr. Trump has pledged to end what he calls the weaponization of the Justice Department and threatened to target his critics.",
      "During her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Bondi said she would \"not politicize\" the department and said \"justice will be administered evenhandedly throughout this country.\"",
      "\"If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"Under my watch, the partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "In the days since Mr. Trump began his second term in office, the Senate has been working to confirm his Cabinet picks. The GOP-led upper chamber installed the top members of his national security team first and now is moving to approve the remaining nominees who will lead federal departments.",
      "Bondi's nomination was first approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee in a 12-10 party-line vote before it was considered by the upper chamber.",
      "As attorney general, Bondi will oversee a sprawling department that includes numerous law enforcement components, including the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Both agencies have often been the target of attacks by Mr. Trump. The president selected another staunch defender, Kash Patel, to lead the FBI.",
      "Bondi will also have the power to investigate the federal probes involving Mr. Trump that were overseen by former special counsel Jack Smith. Smith resigned from the role before the president returned to office, and the two cases brought against Mr. Trump were dismissed because of longstanding Justice Department policy that precludes the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Now, with Mr. Trump back in the White House, his administration has been overseeing the ouster of certain Justice Department employees. Acting Attorney General James McHenry, selected by the president to temporarily lead the department, fired roughly a dozen Justice Department employees who worked for Smith because \"he did not believe these officials could be trusted to faithfully implement the president's agenda because of their significant role in prosecuting the president,\" a Justice Department official said.",
      "And department leadership directed the acting U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., Edward Martin, to terminate prosecutors who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, according to a Jan. 31 memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "At the FBI, which is a component of the Justice Department, the acting deputy attorney general ordered the acting head of the bureau to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned to the investigation into the Jan. 6 attack for review to \"determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "FBI supervisors have also received questionnaires for certain agents in their field offices that contain questions about their possible work on the Jan. 6 cases, such as whether they participated in a search, if they made any arrests or testified in court.",
      "Bondi has previously suggested that the Justice Department prosecutors who were involved in the cases against Mr. Trump would face their own investigation and has repeated the president's claim that there is a so-called deep state of career government employees working to undermine him.",
      "\"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them,\" she told Fox News after he was charged in 2023.",
      "Bondi takes the helm of the Justice Department without the federal prosecution experience that her predecessors have had. She served two terms as Florida's attorney general, during which her office led lawsuits challenging the Affordable Care Act and former President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "After leaving office in 2019, she worked as a lawyer and lobbyist for Ballard Partners, a Florida-based firm. During her tenure there, she represented corporations including General Motors, Amazon and Uber, and lobbied on behalf of the Qatari government, according to registration forms submitted to the federal government.",
      "Bondi briefly left her post at Ballard Partners to serve as a member of Mr. Trump's defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats in his first term. She defended Mr. Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which he pressured Zelenskyy to investigate former President Biden.",
      "Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democrat-led House, becoming the third U.S. president to be impeached, and acquitted by the Republican-led Senate following a trial, where Bondi was part of Mr. Trump's team.",
      "She also spearheaded legal efforts following the 2020 election to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and falsely asserted Mr. Trump won the battleground state. Bondi told the Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation hearing that she accepts the results of the election.",
      "Mr. Trump selected Bondi for attorney general after his first pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, withdrew his name from consideration. Gaetz had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, and he denied any wrongdoing.",

    "story": [
      "The ownership of the Proud Boys' trademark is now in the hands of a Black church that the group vandalized in 2020.",
      "The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., was granted ownership of the group's trademark in a Feb. 3 ruling from Judge Tanya M. Jones Bosier of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. The decision also gives the Metropolitan AME Church a lien on the trademark and the power to block the Proud Boys from using the trademark or selling licensed goods, like T-shirts or hats, without the church's approval.",
      "Reached for comment, former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio pointed to a statement he\u00a0posted on X. In it, he said the judge should be impeached and the church's nonprofit status revoked. The court's decision had been\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by the New York Times.",
      "Tarrio, who had been serving a 22-year sentence for seditious conspiracy tied to his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol building, was pardoned by President Trump after his Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "The ruling on the Proud Boys' copyright stems from an incident on Dec. 12, 2020, when members of the all-male right-wing group attended a \"stop the steal\" event in Washington, D.C., and also attacked the Metropolitan AME Church by climbing over a fence to get onto church property, where they destroyed a \"Black Lives Matters\" sign, according to court documents. A court ordered the Proud Boys to pay the church $2.8 million, money that the group has failed to pay, the documents note.",
      "As a result, the court gave the Metropolitan AME Church ownership of the trademark, providing them with the right to deny use of the group's name and yellow-and-black laurel wreath symbol.",
      "\"This is our time to stand up, to be very clear to the Proud Boys and their ilk that we came here fighting, that we have never ever capitulated to the violent whims of white supremacist groups,\" Rev. William H. Lamar IV, pastor of the Metropolitan AME Church, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they thought we would be afraid, they were wrong. There are many people with us and who stand with us.\"",
      "The Metropolitan AME Church, which was founded in 1838 and has hosted speakers including Frederick Douglass and Eleanor Roosevelt, can now collect funds from sales of Proud Boys merchandise as well as its membership dues, people familiar with the case said. The church can also block the Proud Boys from using the trademark, they said.",
      "The notoriety of the Proud Boys' name likely helped the group in recruitment, which means blocking use of its trademark could both hurt the group's ability to sell merchandise and recruit new members, they added.",
      "\"From our point of view, it's fitting that the money the Proud Boys raised in sales and dues will go to fund the good work of the Metropolitan AME,\" Kaitlin Banner, who represented the church in the case and serves as deputy legal director at the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, told CBS.",

    "summary": "Republican senators cite Vice President JD Vance as a key negotiator in moving President Trump's nominees out of committee and reassuring wavering senators.",
    "story": [
      "The vice presidency may have taken JD Vance out of the Senate, but his brief service there has turned out to be instrumental in the early weeks of the Trump administration.",
      "Vance has proven to be essential in getting President Trump's most controversial cabinet nominees cleared through committees to a full Senate confirmation vote. Multiple Republican senators who were on the fence about supporting some of the president's picks have said it was Vance, their former Senate colleague, who helped them get them to yes on some of President Trump's most controversial Cabinet nominees.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana and a key swing vote, was uncommitted about voting for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department until he had \"intense\" conversations with the White House over the weekend.",
      "\"I want to thank VP JD specifically for his honest counsel,\" Cassidy said in a post on X as he and fellow members of the Senate Finance Committee assembled for their vote Tuesday. \"With the serious commitments I've received from the administration and the opportunity to make progress on the issues we agree on like healthy foods and a pro-American agenda, I will vote yes.\"",
      "Sen. Todd Young, a Republican from Indiana, also said he had extensive conversations with the vice president about confirming former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be the director of national intelligence.",
      "\"We identified \u2014 after looking at her hearing transcript, after a personal visit in the office, after a lot of answers to questions for the record \u2014 some gaps, and there was certain language I wanted her to embrace and her answers to reassure me that those national security gaps would be filled. And I worked with Vice President Vance, and he got me those the requested answers,\" Young told reporters.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, another prolific swing vote, has also complimented Vance and said she has spoken with him about policy.",
      "\"I think all of us who have served with JD have had conversations with him,\" she said. \"I've talked to him, for example, about the difference between our relationships with Canada, which is very important in my state, versus our relationship with Mexico and China.\"",
      "Vance introduced commerce secretary nominee Howard Lutnick at his confirmation hearing last month. And when it came to Trump's embattled nominee for defense secretary, Vance not only ginned up support for Pete Hegseth but also cast the tie-breaking vote to confirm him.",
      "Vance is particularly close to Senate Majority Whip John Barasso, who is responsible for counting votes and is considered an integral part of the team. While he only served in the Senate for two years before becoming vice president, Vance built key relationships in the chamber, and Republicans members view him a trusted colleague. He has been working the phones and talking to senators about their questions and concerns.",
      "But Vance is also not afraid to exert public pressure, too. He put Republican senators on notice last Wednesday after Kennedy and Gabbard testified before the committees that would vote on advancing their nominations.",
      "\"In their own way, both Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr. represent parts of the new coalition in our party. To say they're unwelcome in the cabinet is to insult those new voters,\" Vance wrote in a post on X. \"To reject their confirmation is to reject the idea that President Trump decides his cabinet.\"",
      "Sources close to Vance say he won't have a traditional portfolio like other vice presidents, who are often tasked with taking on less desirable initiatives. Mr. Trump previously assigned former Vice President Mike Pence to lead the coronavirus task force in late February 2020 before the pandemic swept over the country.",
      "Instead, Vance is expected to be a jack of all trades, rather than serving in any specific area. An adviser close to Vance stressed that he is going to be a \"generalist\" focusing on all areas of policy and carrying out Mr. Trump's plans.",
      "Most importantly, Vance will serve as the node between the White House and Capitol Hill, focused on making sure no one is slowing down the Trump agenda in Congress.",

      "Remains from all 67 victims of the midair collision\u00a0over Washington, D.C., that sent an American Airlines regional plane and an Army Black Hawk helicopter crashing into the Potomac River have been recovered, officials said Tuesday.",
      "Officials overseeing recovery efforts from the deadliest U.S. air crash in more than two decades said in a statement that 66 of the remains have been positively identified.",
      "Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board\u00a0said data from air traffic controllers' screens showed the Black Hawk was at an altitude of about 300 feet at the time of Wednesday night's collision. The data is rounded to the nearest 100 feet.",
      "Investigators have said black box data indicated the airliner was flying at around 325 feet, above the\u00a0200-feet ceiling set by the Federal Aviation Administration for helicopter traffic in that area.",
      "The developments come as parts of the plane's cockpit, tail and fuselage and another engine were removed from the water while crews continue the lengthy process of recovering the wreckage from both aircraft.",
      "The pieces of wreckage recovered Tuesday were lifted by a crane and placed onto a barge with other parts recovered from the flight that took off from Wichita, Kansas, for Washington's Reagan National Airport with 60 passengers and four crew members on board. One of the pieces recovered earlier in the day showed a portion of the American Eagle logo.",

Crews were expected to continue pulling out large pieces of the plane through Tuesday evening and shift to recovering the Black Hawk wreckage later in the week.

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Drug policy researcher Jonathan Caulkins said there were 21 large fentanyl seizures at the Mexican border for every one along the Canadian border.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said part of his motivation for imposing now-paused tariffs on Canada was to force the country to crack down on illicit fentanyl trafficking \u2014 but very little of the synthetic opioid enters the U.S. through its northern border.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said\u00a0the tariffs, announced Feb. 1 on Mexico, Canada and China, were \"for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.\" Mr. Trump said in a statement that it was \"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been paused for at least one month following negotiations, while a 10% tariff on China remains in place.",
      "The tariffs were also meant to compel the countries to take further action to stop undocumented immigrants from entering the U.S. and to narrow their trade surplus.",
      "Here's what to know about fentanyl and other drug trafficking over the United States' northern border.",
      "How much fentanyl is seized at Canadian border?",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized just 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last year, according to statistics released publicly by the agency. Meanwhile, about 21,100 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the Mexican border.",
      "Drug policy researcher Jonathan Caulkins conducted an analysis looking at large fentanyl seizures \u2014 those of more than a kilogram of powder or of 1,000 pills or more \u2014 and found such incidents in just two counties bordering Canada. One county is home to the city of Detroit, and Caulkins said the drug seizures conducted there are proportionate to its population. Only one area \u2014 Whatcom County, Washington \u2014 had an amount of drug seizures disproportionate to its population, Caulkins said.",
      "In general, Canada sees far fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl than the United States.",
      "About 49,100 people died from opioid overdoses in Canada between 2016 and 2024, with most of those deaths involving fentanyl, Canadian officials said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0estimated there were more than 74,000 fentanyl-related deaths in 2023 alone.",
      "How is fentanyl entering the United States?",
      "Most fentanyl enters the United States through Mexico, CBS News has previously reported. The\u00a0U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0has said Mexican cartels are \"at the heart\" of the United States' fentanyl crisis.",
      "Caulkins' analysis found 21 large fentanyl seizures along the Mexican border for every such seizure along the Canadian border.",
      "Often, illicit drugs are transported over the southern border by U.S. citizens passing through CBP checkpoints, Caulkins said. The U.S. citizens are usually hired by smuggler groups, which have in turn been hired by cartels and drug manufacturers.",
      "\"In general, it's not like it's a Sinaloa cartel employee walking across the border,\" Caulkins said. U.S. citizens are less likely to be seen as suspicious, he said, and they face fewer obstacles during the actual border crossing.",
      "Precursor chemicals at the border",
      "Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients used to make illicit drugs, have been seized in both Canada and Mexico, as well as within the United States. Precursor chemicals are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, again typically in Mexico, and brought into the United States for distribution.",
      "In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of chemical precursors and fentanyl.",
      "In November 2024, Canadian police said they had dismantled the most sophisticated drug \"super lab\"\u00a0that they had ever seen in the country. They said they seized a \"massive\" amount of precursor chemicals from the facility in British Columbia, as well as 54 kilograms, or about 110 pounds, of fentanyl, along with other drugs.",
      "Police said they believed the lab was a mass production site where fentanyl and methamphetamine were made so they could be distributed in Canada and internationally. Officials did not say what countries the drugs may have been exported to.",
      "In December 2024, Canada said its health agency would create a \"Chemical Precursor Risk Management Unit\" that could \"provide better insight into\" the chemicals and their distribution channels. The unit would also be able to \"enhance monitoring and surveillance\" and allow for \"timely law enforcement action\" in connection to these chemicals. The unit was just one of several ways Canada said it would be fighting the fentanyl crisis.",
      "Health Canada is also set to accelerate its regulatory process for banning precursors \"so that border and law enforcement can take swift action to prevent their illegal importation and use.\"",

      "Two groups of anonymous FBI agents who worked on the Jan. 6 Capitol riot investigation and other federal probes tied to President Trump are suing the federal government over the Justice Department's plans to review the FBI's workforce and scrutinize agents who may have worked on the sensitive investigations, according to two separate lawsuits filed monday.",

      "On Friday, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered Acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll to compile a list of all current and former FBI employees who were assigned \"at any time\" to the Jan. 6 investigation \"to determine whether any additional personnel actions are necessary,\" according to a memo reviewed by CBS News.",
      "In response, on Sunday, agents across the country were asked to complete questionnaires about their involvement in the Jan. 6 and Trump probes as part of a Justice Department evaluation of the workforce.",
      "According to a U.S. official familiar with the process, the FBI subsequently turned over the requested agent and personnel information to Justice Department leadership on Tuesday afternoon. Information like employee ID numbers and titles of 5,000 individuals were on the list, the official said.",
      "There is no indication yet about what actions the Justice Department may take against anyone on the compiled lists and so far, a handful of senior career officials have been fired, while rank-and-file agents remain on the job.",
      "The nine unnamed FBI agents who filed the first lawsuit on Tuesday alleged, \"The purpose for this list is to identify agents to be terminated or to suffer other adverse employment action.\"",
      "Their attorneys asked for a jury trial and wrote that the agents feared \"this list might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution.\"",
      "The second group of agents and the FBI Agents Association alleged social media activity indicated some charged during the Jan. 6 probe who have since been pardoned by the president, \"link to each other in posts promoting violence and insurrection against law enforcement agents.\"",
      "The Justice Department has not \"made any reasonable efforts to ensure that the maintenance and public release of the records at issue in this case are accurate, complete, timely, and relevant for agency purposes,\" the lawsuit said, adding later, \"This bell cannot be unrung, and once the Plaintiffs' personal information is released it will be eternally available on social media.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "McHenry also recently instructed the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C., to fire certain prosecutors who had been\u00a0 assigned to investigate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to a separate memo dated Jan. 31, and reviewed by CBS News. That decision, which mostly affected contract lawyers brought in on an interim basis to prosecute Jan. 6 cases, is not subject to the new lawsuit.",
      "And last week, eight executives at FBI headquarters and the heads of various field offices including in Washington, D.C., were forced to resign, retire or face termination.",

      "The personnel moves make good on a Trump campaign promise to clean house at the Justice Department. Soon after taking office, the president signed an executive order to take on the \"weaponization of the federal government.\"",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk is categorized as a \"special government employee\" through his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative created by President Trump to find ways to trim federal spending.",
      "Musk's employee status was confirmed by White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt on Monday, although she added that she wasn't sure whether the Tesla CEO has gained security clearance.",
      "DOGE, which isn't a federal department, has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers and sparked several lawsuits since Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, with some claiming Musk's DOGE is violating various laws. For instance, two unions and the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy group for older people and retirees, sued on Feb. 3 over DOGE's access to the Treasury Department's payment systems \u2014 which handle everything from tax refunds to Social Security payments \u2014 alleging that the move breaches privacy regulations.",
      "That lawsuit pointed out that, at the time of its filing, Musk's status with the federal government was unclear.",
      "\"The Trump administration has not publicly revealed whether Mr. Musk has been made an officer or employee of the U.S. government or remains a private citizen,\" the lawsuit states. \"The Trump administration also has not publicly revealed the employment status of other individuals who are part of DOGE.\"",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"Elon Musk is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the \"special government employee\" designation.",
      "What is a special government employee?",
      "A special government employee, or SGE, is someone who\"who works, or is expected to work, for the government for 130 days or less in a 365-day period,\" according to the Department of Justice.",
      "The role was created in 1962 as a way to enable the government to tap outside expertise, according to the publication Government Executive. A special government employee can be paid or unpaid, the Justice Department notes.",
      "Which rules must SGEs adhere to?",
      "SGEs \"are subject to most rules, although sometimes in a less restrictive way,\" including ethics and conflict of interest rules, the Justice Department states.",
      "But SGEs also are prohibited from working on issues that impact their financial interests, as well as their spouses, children or organizations in which they work or serve as a director or trustee. Some of Musk's businesses rely on the federal government's contracts, including SpaceX, which was awarded 100 contracts in 2023 worth $3 billion, according to the New York Times.",
      "Musk's potential conflict of interests were highlighted by Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, in a Jan. 31 letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the Tesla CEO's access to the department's payment system.",
      "\"I am concerned Musk's enormous business operations in China \u2014 a country whose intelligence agencies have stolen vast amounts of sensitive data about Americans, including U.S. government employee data by hacking U.S. government systems \u2014 endangers U.S. cybersecurity and creates conflicts of interest that make his access to these systems a national security risk,\" Wyden wrote.",
      "However, an SGE can get a waiver \"if your interest is not large,\" the Justice Department notes. \"If you do not qualify for a waiver, you will have to disqualify yourself from participating in any matter that affects your financial interests.\"",
      "Musk's $418 billion fortune is largely tied up in his stakes in SpaceX, worth $136 billion, and Tesla, valued at $158 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Does Musk need to make disclosures as an SGE?",
      "Special government employees are only required to make a public financial disclosure report if they earn above the GS-15 government pay rate, or about $123,000. If they make below that, they can file on a confidential basis.",
      "It's not clear whether Musk is being paid for his work or if he's participating on a volunteer basis, although DOGE has recruited full-time salaried employees.",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. government is moving quickly to implement President Trump's order to turn facilities at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base into a large-scale immigration detention center, sending the first group of migrant detainees there on Tuesday.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump instructed his administration to dramatically expand detention space inside the naval base to detain as many as 30,000 \"high-priority\" unauthorized immigrants with criminal records. Since then, officials from across the government, including the Departments of Defense, State and Homeland Security, have scrambled to implement the president's directive.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, a plane carrying 10 migrant detainees departed the Fort Bliss Army base near the Texas border for Guantanamo Bay, multiple U.S. officials told CBS News. Two officials said the migrants were classified as \"high-threat\" detainees who would be held in cells inside the naval base. One of the officials said they were Venezuelan men with affiliations to Tren De Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela's prisons.",
      "A U.S. official said those likely to be sent to the naval base in the future would be unauthorized immigrants arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the agency at the center of the president's vow to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history. The agency has ramped up immigration operations across the country under Mr. Trump, averaging between 800 and 1,000 daily arrests in the past week \u2014 up from the 312 average in former President Joe Biden's final year in office.",
      "Over the past several days, there has been an internal debate about whether the Pentagon or DHS would have legal and physical custody over the migrant detainees, and what sort of legal rights they would have.",
      "For decades, the Guantanamo base has included a facility, known as the Migrant Operations Center, where U.S. immigration officials have screened some asylum-seekers intercepted at sea. That area is separate from Guantanamo Bay's detention center, the post-9/11 military prison where the U.S. still holds more than a dozen terrorism suspects.",
      "A relatively small number of migrants are housed in barrack-like facilities while they undergo interviews with asylum officers. Asylum-seekers who passed those initial interviews have been referred for resettlement in third countries like Australia and Canada. The U.S. has long had a policy of not allowing those caught at sea to seek asylum in the U.S. in order to deter maritime migration.",
      "After Mr. Trump's recent directive, U.S. officials have been setting up tent facilities to hold migrants in Guantanamo Bay outside of the Migrant Operations Center, as the new detainees are not expected to be held in that facility.",
      "In the early 1990s, the Clinton administration held thousands of Haitian migrants inside the Guantanamo base, including in a notorious camp for those diagnosed with HIV, who were banned from entering the U.S. at the time.",
      "While visiting the southwest border on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Guantanamo Bay \"the perfect place\" to hold \"hardened criminals.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A group of transgender minors and their families filed a lawsuit on Tuesday that challenges President Trump's executive action restricting access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
      "The suit\u00a0was filed in federal district court in Maryland on behalf of two 12 year-olds who identify as transgender and five transgender teenagers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, along with LGBTQ advocacy groups. They allege that Mr. Trump's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status.",
      "\"The Executive Orders were issued for the openly discriminatory purpose of preventing transgender people from expressing a gender identity different from their sex designated at birth \u2014 and expressing governmental disapproval of transgender people who, by definition, have a gender identity that does not align with their sex designated at birth,\" lawyers for the families wrote in their complaint.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure follows executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to promote gender ideology and declares U.S. policy as recognizing two sexes, male and female.",
      "Half of the states have in recent years passed laws restricting access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July. The Trump administration is likely to reverse the government's position in the case.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the seven transgender individuals argues that Mr. Trump's executive orders involving gender identity are unlawful and unconstitutional because he is usurping Congress' authority by unilaterally seeking to withhold funding from medical institutions, providers and researchers that have already received congressional approval.",
      "\"Under our Constitution, it is Congress, not the president, who is vested with the power of the purse,\" they argued in their filing. \"The president does not have unilateral power to withhold federal funds that have been previously authorized by Congress and signed into law, and the president does not have the power to impose his own conditions on the use of funds when Congress has not delegated to him the power to do so.\"",
      "The challengers warn that Mr. Trump's directive to cut off federal funding for medical providers that offer gender-affirming care has already had \"concrete and immediate effects.\" In one instance, Children's National based in Washington, D.C., announced last week \u2014 on the heels of the president's order \u2014 that it would be pausing its provision of puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender youth.",
      "In another instance, one of the plaintiffs, a 17-year-old from Virginia identified in filings as W.G., was set to continue receiving hormone therapy from doctors at Virginia Commonwealth University Health and Children's Hospital, but had her appointment canceled. The hospital receives more than $100 million in federal grants, according to the complaint, and announced it would be suspending gender-affirming care for patients under the age of 19 in response to Mr. Trump's order.",
      "NYU Langone Health in New York City, which received more than $5.6 million in federal grants over the last 12 months, treats several of the transgender youth involved in the lawsuit but canceled planned procedures for two of them, according to the filing.",
      "\"By directing agencies to withhold all federal funding from entities that 'promote gender ideology' and provide gender affirming medical care to patients under nineteen, the Gender Identity and Denial of Care Orders threaten the ability of medical institutions and healthcare providers throughout the U.S. to provide essential health care to their communities, train the next generation of physicians, and support research to address this country's greatest health challenges,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote.",
      "They are asking the court to declare Mr. Trump's orders are unlawful and block their enforcement.",
      "The president has issued a slew of executive orders in his first weeks back in the White House covering a wide range of issues, from immigration to energy to gender identity. Many have already been the subject of court challenges, and more are expected as federal agencies begin taking steps to implement Mr. Trump's directives.",

      "Collins has promised to cut regulations across the department and elevate the quality of care for veterans.",
      "The challenges facing the department have evolved in recent years, with a younger generation of veterans bringing new health challenges from their service in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.",
      "\"I'm an Iraq War veteran. I understand burn pits because I slept next to one for many months,\" Collins said in his opening remarks during his January confirmation hearing. Collins said that he understand the challenges facing veterans today who \"went time and time again, deployment after deployment\" to conflict zones.",
      "Collins served in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2021. He has been an outspoken conservative since his time in the Georgia state legislature and was a close Trump ally during the president's first term. He ran for Senate in 2020 but lost the Republican primary to Kelly Loeffler, a major GOP donor who Trump has tapped to lead the U.S. Small Business Association.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, called Collins a \"friend\" who has \"an engaging personality that attracts people to what he's working on.\"",
      "\"It's not that they're better doctors or better psychiatrists or better nurses or technicians. It's that they're empathetic,\" Cramer said. \"While they appreciate access to community care, they appreciate the empathy of a fellow veteran, and Doug brings that. But, guys, he's a chaplain. I mean, come on, how perfect is that?\"",
      "Collins' nomination sailed through the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee in a 18-1 vote. The lone dissenter, Sen. Mazie Hirono, a Democrat from Hawaii, said she was concerned that Collins would limit access to reproductive care like IVF or abortion for veterans.",
      "Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, said she had a productive conversation with Collins during his confirmation hearing but pressed him on whether he'd commit to working with Congress to \"strengthen and refine\" the department \"rather than resorting to privatization.\"",
      "Collins said he would be focused on addressing wait times and increasing preventative care.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 11:41:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The number of monarch butterflies spending winter in the western U.S. dropped dramatically this year, despite moves to extend protections for the insect.",
    "story": [
      "The number of monarch butterflies spending the winter in the western United States has dropped to its second-lowest mark in nearly three decades as pesticides, diminishing habitat and climate change take their toll on the beloved pollinator.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Endangered species",
      "Monarch butterflies, known for their distinctive orange-and-black wings, are found across North America. Monarchs in the eastern United States spend their winters in Mexico and are counted by the World Wildlife Fund, which has yet to release data for this year. Monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains typically overwinter along the California coast.",
      "They were officially designated an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in 2022, when estimates suggested populations could have dropped as much as 72% over the course of a decade.",
      "The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation has been counting western overwinter populations along the California coast, northern Baja California and inland sites in California and Arizona for the last 28 years. The highest number recorded was 1.2 million in 1997. The organization announced Friday that it counted just 9,119 monarchs in 2024, a decrease of 96% from 233,394 in 2023. The total was the second-lowest since the survey began in 1997. The record-low was 1,901 monarchs in 2020.",
      "The survey noted that a site owned by The Nature Conservancy in Santa Barbara that saw 33,200 monarchs last winter hosted only 198 butterflies this year.",
      "Mounting threats",
      "Monarchs across the continent face mounting threats, chief among them vanishing milkweed, the host plant for the insect's caterpillars. The plant has been disappearing before a combination of drought, wildfires, agriculture and urban development, according to Monarch Joint Venture, a group that works to protect monarchs. Pesticides have contaminated much of the remaining plants, according to the Xerces Society.",
      "At a festival last September in Minneapolis meant to celebrate the monarch butterflies' migration before winter, some monarch enthusiasts noted that the insects' prevalence seemed to have dwindled compared with previous years, CBS News Minnesota reported.",
      "\"It seems like people are seeing fewer and fewer monarchs than they have in the past,\" Wendy Caldwell, the executive director of Monarch Joint Venture, a St. Paul-based nonprofit organization focused on monarch conservation, told the station.",
      "It's unclear what caused such a sharp drop-off in the western population in just one year, said Emma Pelton, an endangered species biologist with the Xerces Society. The monarch population is already small, she said, and triple-digit heat in the western states last year may have slowed breeding.",
      "Monarchs are threatened by warming temperatures linked to climate change, Elise Zipkin, an associate professor at Michigan State University's environmental science and policy program, told CBS News Detroit last April. Zipkin noted that the insects \"need a very specific kind of temperature and precipitation conditions to develop from an egg all the way into a butterfly, and if those change during certain times of the years, they may not be able to survive quite as successfully or be able to reproduce as successfully.\"",
      "These butterflies suffer when the mercury gets up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit and any temperatures above 108 degrees Fahrenheit are lethal to the insects, Pelton said. The western states saw a heat wave in July that drove temperatures in some areas well past 100 degrees. Palm Springs, for example, hit a record 124 degrees Fahrenheit on July 5. Another heat wave cooked northern California in early October, with multiple cities breaking heat records.",
      "Hopefully a wake-up call\"",
      "Pelton said that it's too early to tell what long-term impact the dramatic losses might have on the overall western monarch population. Insects do have the potential for exponential growth, Pelton said. After bottoming out at 1,901 butterflies in 2020, the population rebounded to 247,246 insects the following year, an increase of nearly 13,000%. The year after that the survey recorded 335,479 monarchs.",
      "\"This is bad news,\" Pelton said of the 2024 population drop. \"But we have seen incredible recovery. this doesn't mean we're not going to have western monarchs. It's hopefully a wake-up call that a bad year can set them back pretty significantly.\"",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced\u00a0in December 2024 that it was working to list monarchs as threatened, a move that would prohibit anyone from killing, transporting them or making changes that would render their property permanently unusable for the species, such as eradicating all milkweed from the land. The listing also would protect 4,395 acres in seven coastal California counties that serve as overwinter sites for western monarchs, meaning federal agencies would be prohibited from destroying or modifying those habitats. Designating the sites as protected doesn't shield against development across the board, but landowners with federal licenses or permits to carry out projects in the area would need to coordinate with the wildlife service to reduce the risks of damage.",
      "\"The iconic monarch butterfly is cherished across North America, captivating children and adults throughout its fascinating life cycle,\" U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Director Martha Williams said in a statement at the time. \"Despite its fragility, it is remarkably resilient, like many things in nature when we just give them a chance. Science shows that the monarch needs that chance, and this proposed listing invites and builds on unprecedented public participation in shaping monarch conservation efforts.\"",
      "A public comment period on the proposal is set to end in March. The agency has until December to officially list the monarch as threatened if officials decide to move forward.",
      "Earthjustice, an environmental law firm, petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2024 to mandate testing pesticide effects on insects such as bees, moths and butterflies.",

They also found that people with dementia had up to 10 times as much plastic in their brains as everyone else.",
      "Microplastics are tiny fragments of degraded polymers that are found in the environment, including our air, water and soil, a news release explained. Previous studies have already shown these substances have made their way into the human body.",

      "The study compared liver, kidney and brain tissue samples from autopsies conducted in 2016 and 2024, and found \"substantially higher concentrations\" in the 2024 brain tissue. The researchers also conducted similar analysis on older and more recent autopsies for people who died with confirmed dementia diagnoses, and found \"far greater\" concentrations.",
      "While it's unclear how particles are actually being transported into the brain, Campen said the size of the micro- and nanoplastics, measuring 200 nanometers or less, are not much larger than viruses and therefore small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier.",
      "In the study, researchers detected 12 different polymers, the most common of which was polyethylene, widely used for packaging and containers, including bottles and cups, the release noted.",

The whole thing is a mess.\"",
      "The president said other \"rich\" nations should pay for a new home for Palestinians, although he did not expand on this suggestion.",

      "U.S. tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico were also set to go into effect Tuesday but Mr. Trump paused his plans to\u00a0implement them\u00a0for at least a month after talks with the leaders of both countries, who vowed to step up efforts to combat the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders with the U.S. He planned to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the next few days.",
      "China said Tuesday it would implement a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products as well as a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. The tariffs would take effect next Monday.",
      "\"The U.S.'s unilateral tariff increase seriously violates the rules of the World Trade Organization,\" the statement from a Ministry of Finance office said. \"It is not only unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also damages normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing said it would file a complaint with the WTO over the \"malicious\" levies, Agence France-Presse reports.",
      "China is the world's largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with its top suppliers being Australia, Qatar and Malaysia. The U.S., which is the biggest exporter of LNG globally, does not significantly export LNG to China.",
      "In addition, China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tuesday it is investigating Google on suspicion of violating antitrust laws. The announcement didn't mention the tariffs but came just minutes after Mr. Trump's 10% tariffs on China were to take effect.",
      "It's unclear how the probe will affect Google's operations. Google has a limited presence in China, and its search engine is blocked in the country like most other Western platforms. Google exited the Chinese market in 2010 after refusing to comply with censorship requests from the Chinese government and following a series of cyberattacks on the company.",

      "In addition to the tariffs and Google probe, China announced export controls on several elements critical to the production of modern high-tech products. They include tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum and indium, many of which are designated as critical minerals by the U.S. Geological Survey, meaning they're essential to U.S. economic or national security and have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "The export controls are in addition to ones China placed in December on key elements such as gallium, which is used in manufacturing.",
      "The Commerce Ministry also placed two American companies on an \"unreliable entities\" list: PVH Group, which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and Illumina, a biotechnology company with offices in China. The listing bars them from engaging in China-related import or export activities and from making new investments in the country.",
      "Beijing began investigating PVH Group in September last year over \"improper Xinjiang-related behavior\" after the company allegedly boycotted the use of Xinjiang cotton.",
      "Possible ramifications",
      "Analysts said China's retaliatory measures would not only cause adverse effects on the U.S. economy but would impact the rest of the world.",
      "This isn't the first round of tit-for-tat actions between the two countries. China and the U.S. had engaged in a trade war in 2018 when Trump raised tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded in kind.",
      "This time, analysts said, China is much better prepared to counter.",
      "\"They have a much more developed export control regime. We depend on them for a lot of critical minerals: gallium, germanium, graphite, a host of others.

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 17:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Drug policy researcher Jonathan Caulkins said there were 21 large fentanyl seizures at the Mexican border for every one along the Canadian border.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has said part of his motivation for imposing now-paused tariffs on Canada was to force the country to crack down on illicit fentanyl trafficking \u2014 but very little of the synthetic opioid enters the U.S. through its northern border.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said\u00a0the tariffs, announced Feb. 1 on Mexico, Canada and China, were \"for the illegal fentanyl they have sourced and allowed to distribute into our country.\" Mr. Trump said in a statement that it was \"because of the major threat of illegal aliens and deadly drugs killing our Citizens, including fentanyl.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been paused for at least one month following negotiations, while a 10% tariff on China remains in place.",
      "The tariffs were also meant to compel the countries to take further action to stop undocumented immigrants from entering the U.S. and to narrow their trade surplus.",
      "Here's what to know about fentanyl and other drug trafficking over the United States' northern border.",
      "How much fentanyl is seized at Canadian border?",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents seized just 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last year, according to statistics released publicly by the agency. Meanwhile, about 21,100 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the Mexican border.",
      "Drug policy researcher Jonathan Caulkins conducted an analysis looking at large fentanyl seizures \u2014 those of more than a kilogram of powder or of 1,000 pills or more \u2014 and found such incidents in just two counties bordering Canada. One county is home to the city of Detroit, and Caulkins said the drug seizures conducted there are proportionate to its population. Only one area \u2014 Whatcom County, Washington \u2014 had an amount of drug seizures disproportionate to its population, Caulkins said.",
      "In general, Canada sees far fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl than the United States.",
      "About 49,100 people died from opioid overdoses in Canada between 2016 and 2024, with most of those deaths involving fentanyl, Canadian officials said. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0estimated there were more than 74,000 fentanyl-related deaths in 2023 alone.",
      "How is fentanyl entering the United States?",
      "Most fentanyl enters the United States through Mexico, CBS News has previously reported. The\u00a0U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration\u00a0has said Mexican cartels are \"at the heart\" of the United States' fentanyl crisis.",
      "Caulkins' analysis found 21 large fentanyl seizures along the Mexican border for every such seizure along the Canadian border.",
      "Often, illicit drugs are transported over the southern border by U.S. citizens passing through CBP checkpoints, Caulkins said. The U.S. citizens are usually hired by smuggler groups, which have in turn been hired by cartels and drug manufacturers.",
      "\"In general, it's not like it's a Sinaloa cartel employee walking across the border,\" Caulkins said. U.S. citizens are less likely to be seen as suspicious, he said, and they face fewer obstacles during the actual border crossing.",
      "Precursor chemicals at the border",
      "Precursor chemicals, or the ingredients used to make illicit drugs, have been seized in both Canada and Mexico, as well as within the United States. Precursor chemicals are largely manufactured in China and shipped overseas, usually to Mexico. The fentanyl is then produced, again typically in Mexico, and brought into the United States for distribution.",
      "In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have announced several major seizures of chemical precursors and fentanyl.",
      "In November 2024, Canadian police said they had dismantled the most sophisticated drug \"super lab\"\u00a0that they had ever seen in the country. They said they seized a \"massive\" amount of precursor chemicals from the facility in British Columbia, as well as 54 kilograms, or about 110 pounds, of fentanyl, along with other drugs.",
      "Police said they believed the lab was a mass production site where fentanyl and methamphetamine were made so they could be distributed in Canada and internationally. Officials did not say what countries the drugs may have been exported to.",
      "In December 2024, Canada said its health agency would create a \"Chemical Precursor Risk Management Unit\" that could \"provide better insight into\" the chemicals and their distribution channels. The unit would also be able to \"enhance monitoring and surveillance\" and allow for \"timely law enforcement action\" in connection to these chemicals. The unit was just one of several ways Canada said it would be fighting the fentanyl crisis.",
      "Health Canada is also set to accelerate its regulatory process for banning precursors \"so that border and law enforcement can take swift action to prevent their illegal importation and use.\"",

    "summary": "The FBI issued seeking information posters for two Iranian intelligence officers believed to be responsible for the 2007 abduction of Robert Levinson.",
    "story": [
      "Federal authorities have released a pair of seeking information posters for two Iranian intelligence officers accused of authorizing the 2007 abduction of retired FBI special agent Robert Levinson. The posters come as part of a decades-long investigation into Levinson's disappearance, the FBI's Washington field office said Tuesday, noting their \"commitment to resolving the case for his long-suffering family.\"",
      "Since Levinson vanished, the United States has maintained the view that he was abducted during an unauthorized CIA mission in Iran and held wrongfully by the Iranian government. The former agent was thought to be alive until U.S. officials said in 2020 that intelligence suggested he may have been dead for \"some time.\"",
      "The posters include images of Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai, the Iranian senior intelligence officers believed to be responsible for Levinson's abduction, subsequent detention and probable death. The men are described as high-ranking officers in Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, according to the FBI.",
      "Levinson has not been seen or heard from since March 9, 2007, one day after the retired agent traveled to the Iranian island of Kish, according to the FBI. U.S. officials say Levinson's family received video and photographs of Levinson in anonymous emails several years later, in 2010 and 2011, which showed him in captivity. They ultimately released the footage and an image publicly but could not trace the emails back to their senders.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Baseri and Khazai under the Trump administration in 2020, the first time the country formally blamed Iran for Levinson's disappearance. At the time, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that Iranian officials \"authorized Levinson's abduction and detention and launched a disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the regime.\"",
      "His statement identified Baseri and Khazai by name.",
      "The U.S. has also accused Iran of sanctioning the scheme that resulted in Levinson's abduction and claimed its government knew the missing agent's location and lied about it for nearly 18 years.",
      "Federal officials claim Baseri has been involved in counterespionage activities within and outside of Iran, in addition to sensitive investigations related to Iranian national security, and \"has worked directly with intelligence officials from other countries to harm U.S. interests.\" Khazai has allegedly led Iranian intelligence and security delegations to other countries, the FBI said.",
      "The State Department is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information that leads to Levinson's recovery and return, while the FBI put forward a prize of up to $5 million for the same.",
      "\"The FBI remains steadfast in our commitment to return Bob to his family,\" said Sanjay Virmani, special agent in charge of the counterterrorism division at the FBI's Washington field office, in a statement.\u00a0\"Our extensive investigation continues to develop new leads and intelligence, and we will pursue all options to hold every Iranian official involved in his abduction accountable.\"",

    "summary": "Swedish police say about 10 people have been killed in a shooting at a school for adults in the city of Orebro, including the suspected gunman.",
    "story": [
      "Police in Sweden said Tuesday that \"about 10 people\" were killed in a shooting earlier in the day at a school for adults in the city of Orebro, west of Stockholm. The police offered\u00a0very little information on the incident throughout the most of the day, saying only that five people were wounded, including the suspected shooter, before suddenly confirming the initial death toll at about 6 p.m. local time (noon Eastern).",
      "The shooting occurred at the Campus Risbergska school, which, according to its website, is for students over the age of 20. The Reuters news agency said the adult education center is on campus that includes children's schools.",
      "Local police chief Roberto Eid Forest told reporters that the suspected shooter was among those who had died, but he stressed that the ongoing investigation was complicated and they were still working to identify the victims and confirm the death toll. The national police force said in a separate message that the \"total number of injured\" remained uncertain.",
      "Officials said the motive remained unknown, but at present, there were not believed to be any additional perpetrators. However, in a news statement later in the evening, police said they \"cannot rule out more perpetrators connected to the incident.\"",
      "Before the fatalities were confirmed Forest said the \"the investigation is somewhat unclear,\" according to The Associated Press, including \"whether the shooting took place inside the school (building) or whether there may be more perpetrators.\"",
      "\"One of the injured persons is a person whom we suspect may be the assailant,\" Forest said at a news conference with medical officials, as the massive police operation continued more than three hours after the attack. \"We can't rule out other suspects, and that's something we are continuing to work on in this intensive phase now \u2014 why it happened and if there are other possible suspects.\"",
      "Medical officials said four of five wounded people had undergone surgery, including one whose injuries were serious. The AP cited a regional medical director as saying two others were in stable condition and a third was only slightly wounded. No police officers were shot, the force confirmed.",
      "A statement attributed to National Police Chief Petra Lundh said, \"Our thoughts go out to the victims and their families.\"",
      "\"A major operation is currently underway at a school in V\u00e4sthaga, Orebro,\" the police said in an earlier statement posted online, urging members of the public \"to stay away from the V\u00e4sthaga area\" or, if not possible, to remain inside their homes.",
      "\"The operation concerns threats of deadly violence,\" the police said.",
      "\"The extent of the injuries is unclear,\" the police said, adding a reference to charges of \"attempted murder, arson and aggravated weapons offense.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Feb 2025 09:52:32 -0500",
    "summary": "After meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio, El Salvador's president has offered to house U.S. deportees and even American inmates in his country's \"mega-prison.\"",
    "story": [
      "San Salvador, El Salvador \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late Monday that El Salvador's president has offered to accept and incarcerate deportees from the U.S. of any nationality, including criminals with American citizenship currently imprisoned in the U.S. President Nayib Bukele confirmed the offer in a social media post, saying El Salvador was willing to rehouse deportees and American prisoners in a two-year-old \"mega-prison\" he had built as potent symbol of his crackdown on criminal gangs.",
      "Bukele \"has agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world,\" Rubio said after meeting the Salvadoran leader at his lakeside country house outside San Salvador for several hours.",
      "\"We can send them and he will put them in his jails,\" Rubio said of migrants of all nationalities detained in the United States. \"He's also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're U.S. citizens or legal residents.\"",
      "Bukele confirmed the offer in a post on X, saying El Salvador has \"offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system.\"",
      "He said his country would accept only \"only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee\" that he said \"would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire working with Mr. Trump to remake the federal government, responded on his X platform, \"Great idea!!\"",
      "After Rubio spoke, a U.S. official said the Trump administration had no current plans to try to deport American citizens, but said Bukele's offer was significant. The U.S. government cannot deport American citizens, and such a move would be met with significant legal challenges.",
      "CBS News reported\u00a0last month that El Salvador had agreed to accept U.S. deportations of \"criminal illegal migrants from any country,\" including members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "Rubio was visiting El Salvador to press a friendly government to do more to meet President Trump's demands for a major crackdown on\u00a0immigration.",
      "The State Department describes El Salvador's overcrowded prisons as \"harsh and dangerous.\" On its current country information webpage it says, \"In many facilities, provisions for sanitation, potable water, ventilation, temperature control and lighting are inadequate or nonexistent.\"",
      "Unlike many of the country's prisons, however, the massive facility known as CECOT that Bukele referred to after his talks with Rubio remains more than half-empty, according to the French news agency AFP, with capacity for 40,000 inmates but only about 15,000 currently estimated to be incarcerated there.",
      "Formally called the Terrorism Confinement Center, CECOT is surrounded by high concrete walls and it sits on the edge of a jungle about 45 miles southeast of San Salvador. According to AFP, inmates at the prison are only permitted to leave their cells for court hearings, which are conducted via video link, or for 30 minutes of daily exercise in an enclosed hall.",
      "Rubio arrived in San Salvador shortly after watching a U.S.-funded deportation flight with 43 migrants leave from Panama for Colombia. That came a day after Rubio delivered a warning to Panama that unless the government moved immediately to eliminate China's presence at the Panama Canal, the U.S. would act to do so.",
      "Migration, though, was the main issue of the day, as it will be for the next stops on Rubio's five-nation Central American tour of Costa Rica, Guatemala and the Dominican Republic after Panama and El Salvador. His tour is taking place at a time of turmoil in Washington over the status of the government's main foreign development agency.",
      "The Trump administration prioritizes stopping people from making the journey to the United States and has worked with regional countries to boost immigration enforcement on their borders as well as to accept deportees from the United States.",
      "The agreement Rubio described for El Salvador to accept foreign nationals arrested in the United States for violating U.S. immigration laws is known as a \"safe third country\" agreement. Officials have suggested this might be an option for Venezuelan gang members convicted of crimes in the United States should Venezuela refuse to accept them, but Rubio said Bukele's offer was for detainees of any nationality.",
      "Human rights activists have warned that El Salvador lacks a consistent policy for the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees and that such an agreement might not be limited to violent criminals.",
      "Manuel Flores, the secretary general of the leftist opposition party Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, criticized the \"safe third country\" plan, saying it would signal that the region is Washington's \"backyard to dump the garbage.\"",
      "After meeting with Bukele, Rubio signed a memorandum of understanding with his Salvadoran counterpart to advance U.S.-El Salvador civil nuclear cooperation. The document could lead to a more formal deal on cooperation in nuclear power and medicine that the U.S. has with numerous countries.",
      "The deportation flight Rubio watched being loaded in Panama City was carrying migrants detained by Panamanian authorities after illegally crossing the Darien Gap from Colombia. The State Department says such deportations send a message of deterrence. The U.S. has provided Panama with financial assistance to the tune of almost $2.7 million in flights and tickets since an agreement was signed to fund them.",
      "Rubio was on the tarmac for the departure of the flight, which was taking 32 men and 11 women back to Colombia. It's unusual for a secretary of state to personally witness such a law enforcement operation, especially in front of cameras.",
      "\"Mass migration is one of the great tragedies in the modern era,\" Rubio said, speaking afterward in a nearby building. \"It impacts countries throughout the world. We recognize that many of the people who seek mass migration are often victims and victimized along the way, and it's not good for anyone.\"",
      "Monday's deportation flight came as Mr. Trump has been threatening action against nations that will not accept flights of their nationals from the United States, and he briefly hit Colombia with penalties last week for initially refusing to accept two flights. Panama has been more cooperative and has allowed flights of third-country deportees to land and sent migrants back before they reach the United States.",
      "His trip comes amid a sweeping freeze in U.S. foreign assistance and stop-work orders that have shut down U.S.-funded programs targeting illegal migration and crime in Central American countries. The State Department said Sunday that Rubio had approved waivers for certain critical programs in countries he is visiting, but details of those were not immediately available.",
      "While Rubio was out of the country, staffers of the U.S. Agency for International Development were instructed Monday to stay out of the agency's Washington headquarters after Musk announced Mr. Trump had agreed with him to shut the agency.",
      "Thousands of USAID employees already had been laid off and programs shut down. Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting administrator of USAID but had delegated that authority so he would not be running its day-to-day operations.",
      "The change means that USAID is no longer an independent government agency as it had been for decades - although its new status will likely be challenged in court - and will be run out of the State Department by department officials.",
      "In his remarks, Rubio stressed that some and perhaps many USAID programs would continue in the new configuration but that the switch was necessary because the agency had become unaccountable to the executive branch and Congress.",
      "On his weekend discussion with Panama's president on the Panama Canal, Rubio said he was hopeful that the Panamanians would heed his and Mr. Trump's warnings on China. Panamanians have bristled at Mr. Trump's insistence on retaking control of the American-built canal, which the U.S. turned over in 1999, although they have agreed to pull out of a Chinese infrastructure and development initiative.",
      "\"I understand that it's a delicate issue in Panama,\" Rubio told reporters in San Salvador. \"We don't want to have a hostile and negative relationship with Panama,\" he said. \"I don't believe we do. And we had a frank and respectful conversation, and I hope it'll yield fruits and result in the days to come.\"",
      "But back in Washington, Mr. Trump was less diplomatic, saying: \"China's involved with the Panama Canal. They won't be for long and that's the way it has to be.\"",
      "\"We either want it back, or we're going to get something very strong, or we're going to take it back,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And China will be dealt with.\"",

    "summary": "Citing an expert review of the prosecution's arguments, a lawyer for nurse Lucy Letby says there's \"overwhelming evidence\" she was wrongly convicted of murder.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 A panel of experts has disputed the medical evidence used to convict British nurse Lucy Letby of murdering seven newborns and trying to kill seven others, a doctor who led the examination said Tuesday. Dr. Shoo Lee, a retired neonatologist from Canada, said the group of 14 doctors concluded the newborns either died of natural causes or from bad medical care.",
      "\"In summary then, ladies and gentlemen, we did not find murders,\" Lee said at a London news conference.",
      "Letby, 35, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murder and attempted murder while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "Defense lawyer Mark McDonald said there was now \"overwhelming evidence\" that Letby was wrongly convicted.",
      "It was the second news conference held in part by McDonald to challenge the conclusions of Dr. Dewi Evans, who was the prosecution's key expert witness.",
      "Prosecutors said Letby left little trace when she killed babies and in some cases had injected air into their bloodstreams or stomach, causing an embolism. But Lee said Evans had misinterpreted his 1989 academic paper on embolism.",
      "Lee said he assembled a prestigious group of international medical experts who volunteered to review the records of 17 babies Letby was accused of injuring or killing.",
      "Evans diagnosed the babies with air embolism in the absence of finding another cause of death, Lee said. But Lee said embolism is very rare and the skin discoloration described at trial was not consistent with what is seen when there is an embolism.",
      "\"The notion that these babies can be diagnosed with air embolism because they collapsed and had these skin discolorations has no evidence in fact,\" Lee said.",
      "Letby has already lost two bids for an appeal. Her lawyer submitted an application on Monday to get the Criminal Case Review Commission to examine her conviction, which could lead to another shot at an appeal.",
      "A separate public inquiry into failures at the hospital that led babies to repeatedly be harmed is due to conclude next month. That probe is not examining evidence used to convict Letby but is aimed at accountability of hospital staff and management and looking at how parents were treated.",
      "During her trial, Senior Prosecutor Nicola Wyn Williams alleged that Letby had removed one baby's breathing support and that a doctor found her standing by doing nothing as the child struggled,",
      "Williams alleged that Letby then removed the breathing tube two more times over the next few hours, \"in an attempt to cover her tracks and suggest that the first dislodgment was accidental.\"",
      "Dr. Ravi Jayaram, a pediatrician at the hospital, told jurors he saw \"no evidence\" that Letby had done anything to help the baby when he walked in and saw her standing next to the newborn's incubator.",
      "Letby told the jury in that case that she had no recollection of any such event, and she has always denied committing any of the offenses she had been convicted of.",

      "A violin made by the famed Antonio Stradivari in 1714 has the potential to become the most expensive musical instrument ever sold when it goes up for auction Friday at Sotheby's in New York.",
      "The auction house is estimating the value of the \"Joachim-Ma Stradivarius\" at $12 million to $18 million. If it sells at the top end of that range, it could best the $15.9 million paid in 2011 for another Stradivarius, the \"Lady Blunt,\" made in 1721 and named by Guinness World Records as the most expensive instrument ever sold at auction.",
      "Mari-Claudia Jimenez, Sotheby's Americas president and head of global business, said Stradivari made the violin during his \"Golden Period,\" which began around 1700 and was marked by an improvement in his craftmanship.",
      "\"So this is the peak of his output,\" Jimenez said. \"This is the best violin of this era.\"",
      "Sotheby's says the violin's preservation is remarkable and its ownership history extraordinary.",
      "It's named for two of its famed owners - violin virtuosos Joseph Joachim of Hungary, who lived from 1831 to 1907, and Si-Hon Ma, who was born in China in 1926, moved to the U.S. in 1948 and died in 2009.",
      "It's believed that legendary composer Johannes Brahms was influenced by the Joachim-Ma when he wrote his \"Violin Concerto in D Major\" because of its rich, resonant tone, and that Joachim played that violin during the concerto's 1879 premiere, according to Sotheby's.",
      "Ma acquired the violin in 1969 and his estate gifted it to the New England Conservatory in Boston after his death. Ma attended the conservatory, where he earned a master's degree in 1950. The conservatory is now putting the violin up for auction, with all the proceeds going to student scholarships.",

    "story": [
      "More than 80 years after a Brazilian warship was sunk by a German submarine during World War II, the vessel's location has finally been confirmed, Brazil's navy has revealed. The historic vessel was positively identified over a decade after a fisherman's net became ensnared on the shipwreck, without him realizing what the obstacle was.",
      "On the night of July 19, 1944, the \"Vital de Oliveira\" was torpedoed by a Nazi German sub. It was the only Brazilian military ship to be sunk by enemy forces during World War II, the navy said in a news release. About 100 of the ship's crew of approximately 270 were killed.",
      "The ship had mainly been used to transport soldiers and supplies along the coast, and according to Brazil's O Globo newspaper, the crew included teenagers who worked as cabin boys.",
      "The site of the wreck was initially found in 2011 by a pair of brothers after a fisherman's net got stuck at the bottom of the sea, the navy said. Ultimately, a deep-sea diver named Domingos Afonso J\u00f3rio discovered that the net was stuck on a cannon, and he reported the wreck site to the navy. But officials could not confirm any shipwreck at the time.",
      "The navy said Friday that the location of the hull of the sunken ship was finally confirmed last month, about 40 miles off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.\u00a0 The discovery was confirmed during a survey by an oceanographic research vessel, also called \"Vital de Oliveira.\"",
      "Archaeologists used sophisticated equipment to gather data about the position and condition of the vessel, the navy said. A multibeam echo sounder was used to create 3-D models of the ocean floor, and a side scan sonar generated high-resolution acoustic images of the wreck.",
      "\"The equipment used allowed us to obtain unprecedented images of the hull,\" the navy said in a statement.",
      "The images obtained during the survey will be used to create three-dimensional models of the shipwreck, the navy said.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Dr. Atul Gawande said denigrating USAID is \"dangerous for the country\" and shuttering its programs could make Americans less safe.",
    "story": [
      "Former USAID Global Health director  Dr. Atul Gawande criticized the Trump administration's plan to merge the United States Agency for International Development into the State Department and the funding freezes that are putting key aid programs in jeopardy. Asked about the changes, he said, \"It's not an overhaul. It's a destruction.\"",
      "Gawande, a surgeon, medical professor and best-selling author, told CBS News on Monday that the \"destruction\" began a week ago after the White House Office of Management and Budget released a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance. The memo was walked back days later and the ordered freeze has been halted by a federal court, but programs appear to still be halted or in limbo.",
      "\"You're talking about 20 million people in the global HIV program\u00a0that has reduced HIV around the world, they are going without medication that keeps them alive,\" Gawande said. \"You're talking about disease outbreaks that are not being stopped, like bird flu, where monitoring has been turned off in 49 countries.\"",
      "\"There is a great deal of harm being done, and this change to take away the independent status [of USAID] is just a nail in the coffin after a purge of personnel that has decimated the agency,\" Gawande said.",
      "Other former USAID workers expressed similar concerns.",
      "Maura Reap, who was a USAID contractor with the Bureau for Global Health until last week, had just arrived on a two-week assignment in Ethiopia when Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0ordered a pause\u00a0on all new U.S. foreign assistance programs funded by the State Department and USAID. During the first week of the assignment, Reap was supposed to be focused on designing a project supporting survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Reap, whose expertise is in mental health, said the program had been planned for months.",
      "\"We had some meetings over the weekend, and there was just a lot of uncertainty,\" Reap said in an interview with CBS News. \"It was like a slow train wreck.\"",
      "Eventually, she got an email saying she had to return to Washington, D.C. While she was in the air, she and her two colleagues had received termination notices.",
      "\"This terrible waste of a [temporary duty travel] with all the planning and investment that had gone into it, and it was for nothing,\" she said.",
      "Gawande also hit back at Mr. Trump and\u00a0billionaire Elon Musk's comments, who have both slammed the agency, with Mr. Trump recently saying the USAID is \"run by a bunch of radical lunatics.\" Musk said the agency \"is not an apple with a worm in it, what we have actually, just a ball of worms.\"",
      "Gawande countered, \"What we're talking about are disaster relief workers, we're talking about health workers and people who are doing good and protecting America around the world.\"",
      "The Trump administration is expected to announce details in the coming days about the disruption to the USAID, a 60-year-old organization that provides humanitarian aid to more than 100 countries. The agency provides humanitarian assistance abroad, particularly to countries recovering from disaster and trying to escape poverty. In fiscal year 2023, USAID managed more than $40 billion in appropriations, the Congressional Research Service said, a figure that is less than 1% of the federal budget.",
      "Mr. Trump has vowed to cut the size of the federal government, and USAID has been a recent target of his and Musk's, who is tasked with leading the newly created\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Earlier Monday, the White House released a list of examples of what it deemed wasteful spending by USAID in recent years. Democratic lawmakers, however, have warned that any attempt to change USAID's structure and funding would require an act of Congress.",
      "Reap expressed dismay that \"somebody who's not even elected can come in and just take this 60-year-old institution that has accomplished so much ... and to have so much disregard and to take it and to turn it and to throw it on his back and to say, this is not \u2014 this is, we're throwing it out.\"",
      "Gawande said it's \"dangerous for the country to denigrate\" the agency, saying it's the country's \"largest civilian operational capacity for advancing\" the work of the U.S. abroad.",
      "\"We're talking about world-class expertise. For example, the malaria program. Two-thirds have been fired, and the activity shutdown includes one of the global experts in malaria for us. How does that make us safer? How does that make us stronger?\" Gawande said.",
      "Reap also argued that the work USAID does saves lives and supports policies that benefit the United States.",
      "\"Because, I mean, there's so many things related to the work we do,\" Reap said. \"Stopping outbreaks, reducing the push and pull factors for migration at our southern \u2014 at our borders. The work we do counters extremism, and it leads \u2014 it contributes to stable communities by the work we're doing by keeping people healthy so they can contribute to their communities.\"",
      "Gawande noted, \"Every administration goes through an overhaul that says they want to change policy, they want to change some direction, but you don't decimate and demolish the institution in the process. There was no need to close down all of its functions, which is harming people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Almost 96% of new cars registered in Norway in January were electric, an unparalleled proportion in the world and close to the country's goal of selling only zero-emission vehicles as of this year. A total of 9,343 new cars were sold in January, of which 8,954 were all-electric, the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) said.",
      "Of the 50 most-sold models, only two were non-electric, the first of which came in 33rd place, the OFV said.",
      "By comparison, the share of electric cars sold in Europe was just 13.6% in the full-year 2024 \u2014 a decline for the first time since 2020, according to the car manufacturers' lobby ACEA. Even that far out-paces EV sales in the U.S., where, according to MotorTrend data from last year, only about 6% of new vehicles sold were electric.",
      "With President Trump now in office after vows to reduce incentives on EV sales brought in under his predecessor, a continued downward trend in U.S. uptake is entirely possible.",
      "\"We've never seen this before... If the rest of the year continues like this, we will very soon be close to the 2025 goal,\" OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement. \"But if we want to cross the finish line with 100 percent electric cars, it will be necessary to maintain the incentives that make it profitable to choose an electric car over other models.\"",
      "Despite being a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\" starting in 2025, which is 10 years ahead of the goal set by the European Union, of which Norway is not a member.",
      "In contrast to Brussels' plans, Oslo has not banned the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, having instead opted for a system of generous tax breaks that have made them competitive against heavily taxed internal combustion cars.",

      "\"Another reason was of course the benefits that come with them,\" he said, describing himself as a \"climate enthusiast.\"",

      "\"It's less complicated now that the network is so well-developed. You don't have to plan your trip as much as before,\" he said, adding that he uses the 15-20 minute charging breaks needed to make it up to the mountains to shop for food.",
      "Even if EV sales fail to meet the 100% mark this year, experts say that Norway can be seen as having met its goal.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Feb 2025 10:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "America's closest neighbors and allies are racing to respond, or bracing for impact as Trump orders big tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Canadian sports fans, angry at President Trump's unilateral imposition of 25% tariffs on virtually everything imported from Canada, reacted icily to the Star-Spangled Banner as it was sung at hockey and basketball games over the weekend. Many booed the U.S. national anthem in an uncharacteristic show of frustration after more than 150 years of peaceful, friendly relations along the vast border separating the neighbors.",
      "The reaction was representative of hurt feelings both north and south of the U.S. mainland's borders on Monday. Top officials in Canada and Mexico, which both faced 25% tariffs\u00a0with the stroke of Mr. Trump's pen on Saturday, were expected to hold conversations with the White House on the way forward in a new trade war that Mr. Trump had threatened for months. Both countries vowed to respond with their own trade measures.",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum announced in a brief statement Monday on social media that, after a phone call with Mr. Trump, the tariffs imposed on her country were \"on pause for one month from now.\" She said Mr. Trump had agreed to put the measures on hold after she committed to reinforcing Mexico's border with the U.S. \"with 10,000 members of the National Guard to prevent drug trafficking from Mexico to the United States.\"",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed the pause in his own social media post, saying the newly deployed Mexican forces \"will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Mr. Trump had \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "China was also hit by a new raft of tariffs and has warned that it, too, will respond in kind. America's major allies and trade partners in Europe, meanwhile, have been warned by Mr. Trump that the European Union is next on his list, while the United Kingdom appears to have a chance to negotiate a trade deal, but will find itself torn between its next-door neighbors and its storied \"special relationship\" with the U.S. if it hopes to dodge the same fate.",
      "Canada is the biggest export market for products coming from 36 U.S. states, according to the Reuters news agency, while Mexico is broadly considered the U.S.' largest trading partner overall.",
      "Below is a look at some of the reaction from the countries now facing new U.S. tariffs, which will come into effect on Tuesday, and those which might still be hoping to avoid them.",
      "Canada:",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government had no choice but to strike back with 25% tariffs of its own on more than $150 billion worth of U.S.-made imports.",
      "\"First, I want to speak directly to Americans, our closest friends and neighbors,\" said Trudeau. \"This is a choice that, yes, will harm Canadians, but beyond that, it will have real consequences for you, the American people.\"",
      "\"Like the American tariffs, our response will also be far reaching and include everyday items such as American beer, wine and bourbon. Fruits and fruit juices including orange juice, along with vegetables, perfume, clothing and shoes. It will include major consumer products like household appliances, furniture and sports equipment, and materials like lumber and plastics, along with much, much more.\"",
      "\"Now is the time to choose products made right here in Canada,\" Trudeau added to his own constituents in a post on social media. \"Check the labels. Let's do our part. Wherever we can, choose Canada.\"",
      "The first round of Canada's tariffs will kick in at the stroke of midnight on Monday evening \u2013 on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods. In 21 days, the remainder of the tariffs, covering an additional $125 billion worth of products, will kick in unless some new agreement is reached between the countries. The delay, said Trudeau, was aimed at giving Canadian companies time to seek supply chain options to soften the financial blow.",
      "Speaking to ABC News on Sunday, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman said many people in her country \"just don't understand where this is coming from... and probably, there's a little bit of hurt.\"",
      "Mexico:",
      "Canada's government is now looking south of the U.S. border, hoping to band together and increase trade ties with Mexico to help both nations absorb the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. The two countries have agreed \"to enhance the strong bilateral relations\" they share and officials have had extensive bilateral meetings with their counterparts.",
      "President Sheinbaum, who haD already mocked Mr.Trump's move to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, said on social media before the pause was announced that countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs would soon be implemented.",
      "\"I've instructed my economy minister to implement the plan B we've been working on, which includes tariff and non-tariff measures in defense of Mexico's interests,\" Sheinbaum said, without specifying which U.S. goods her government might target, or whether she would seek to match the 25% retaliatory tariffs set to be imposed by Canada.",
      "Mexican goods exported to the U.S. are wide-ranging, and include vehicles and other auto industry components, crude oil, natural gas, avocados, tomatoes, pork and cheese.",
      "China:",
      "For Beijing, it was deja-vu. During Mr. Trump's first term, he slapped 25% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, then 10% on an additional $300 billion worth of imports, which meant virtually everything Chinese was tariffed.",
      "China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement over the weekend saying Beijing was \"strongly dissatisfied and firmly opposes\" the new 10% tariffs, that the U.S.'s \"unilateral increase in tariffs seriously violates WTO rules,\" and that China \"will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take corresponding countermeasures,\" which implies Beijing will impose 10% retaliatory tariffs on select U.S.-made goods.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "Analysts say China better prepared than ever for trade war with U.S.",
      "In a Sunday statement, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't drop any hints as to what measures might be coming, but it said called \"on the United States to correct its wrongdoings, maintain the hard-won positive dynamics in the counternarcotics cooperation, and promote a steady, sound and sustainable development of China-U.S. relationship.\"",
      "The ministry said the U.S. should \"view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way,\" rather than \"threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was imposing the new 10% tariff on Chinese goods in part due to what he considers Beijing's failure to stem the flow of fentanyl and chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The foreign ministry in Beijing said China was \"one of the world's toughest countries on counternarcotics, both in terms of policy and its implementation.\"",
      "The European Union:",
      "Mr. Trump said over the weekend that tariffs on the European Union were coming, but he did not say when or how steep they would be.",
      "\"It will definitely happen with the European Union. I can tell you that because they've really taken advantage of us,\" the U.S. president told reporters Sunday. \"They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm products. They take almost nothing and we take everything from them.\"",
      "European leaders were meeting Monday in Brussels, where they were discussing how to collectively address the threat.",
      "\"We were listening carefully to those words, and of course we are preparing also on our side,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Monday in Brussels, adding a warning that \"there are no winners in trade wars.\"",
      "If the Trump administration \"starts a trade war [with Europe], then the one laughing on the side is China,\" said Kallas. \"We are very interlinked.\"",
      "Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the leader of Europe's biggest economy, Germany, said the EU was strong enough to take the blow and respond to any U.S. tariffs, but added that \"the goal should be that things result in cooperation\" within Europe.",
      "For a quick fact check on Mr. Trump's criticism: He's not wrong about the lop-sided trade relationship between the U.S. and its close allies across the Atlantic. Through November 2024, the EU ran a trade deficit of $78 billion with the U.S., according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and reports indicate that's on track to be a new record.",
      "The question many economic analysts and politicians across the world will keep asking, however, is whether huge tariffs taxing that trade are likely to help balance the books.",
      "The United Kingdom:",
      "Speaking to reporters early on Monday, Mr. Trump said \"the U.K. is out of line but\u2026 I think that one can be worked out,\" suggesting his administration was at least willing to negotiate with London over a new bilateral trade deal.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Sunday that he had spoken with Mr. Trump and stressed that he wants \"a strong trading relationship\" with the U.S., but the U.K. leader, five years after the \"Brexit\" withdrawal from the European Union, may now find himself caught between the formidable trade forces of the EU on his doorstep and Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs on the EU and his looming, if tempered threat to hit Britain with the same will complicate Starmer's nascent efforts to \"reset\" U.K. trade ties with the EU. He's at the helm of the U.K.'s first Labour Party government in a decade and a half, and it was the former Conservative leadership that ushered in Brexit and soured the long-standing close ties with Europe.",
      "Starmer has moved cautiously as he sets out to mend fences with the EU, wary of riling up conservative voters who supported Brexit and who, to some degree, now support populist politicians such as the Trump-aligned, anti-immigration leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage.",
      "The prime minister has ruled out rejoining the EU customs union or its single currency market, and he's so far resisted pressure from the continent to ease post-Brexit restrictions on U.K. and EU citizens living and working on either side of the border, at least for young people.",
      "But he still needs to get U.K.-EU trade moving again, and the extent to which he chooses to keep the bloc next door at arm's length, or to try to reinstate the close trade ties of before Brexit, could directly impact his chances of nailing down a favorable new trade agreement with Washington.",
      "Speaking Monday, a spokesperson for Starmer's government called the U.K.'s trade relationship with the U.S. \"fair and balanced,\" calling Washington \"an indispensable ally and one of our closest trading partners.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former British soldier convicted of spying for Iran after an audacious three-day escape from a London prison was sentenced Monday to more than 14 years behind bars for betraying his country.",
      "Daniel Khalife, 23, was convicted in November of violating the Official Secrets Act and Terrorism Act for providing restricted and classified material to Iran.",
      "\"As a young man you had the makings of an exemplary soldier, however, through the repeated violations of your oath of service, you showed yourself to be instead a dangerous fool,\" Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said.",
      "\"You are an attention seeker and you enjoyed the notoriety you attracted following your escape from prison,\" the judge added, according to the BBC.",
      "Jurors in Woolwich Crown Court had rejected his testimony that he was trying to work for the U.K. as a double agent.",
      "Khalife's spying case had not received much attention until he broke out of Wandsworth Prison on the underbelly of a food delivery truck. He was on the run for three days before police arrested him on a bicycle by a canal in London.",
      "Khalife pleaded guilty to the escape during his trial, but continued to contest the spying charges.",
      "Khalife's lawyer, who argued his acts were more like a plot from \"Scooby Doo\" than a James Bond thriller, said his client had only passed along imprecise information, including \"laughably fake\" documents that caused no actual damage.",
      "\"There's no way that what Mr. Khalife did is going to wind up being a lesson for budding spies,\" attorney Gul Nawaz Hussain said. \"His intentions were neither sinister nor cynical.\"",
      "The court also heard a number of mitigating factors, including a psychological report from 2023 diagnosing him with Antisocial Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder, the BBC reported.",
      "But prosecutors said Khalife had in fact played a \"cynical game\" by claiming he wanted to be a spy after he had delivered a large amount of restricted and classified material to the Iranian intelligence service, including the names of special forces officers.",
      "Khalife testified that he had been in touch with people in the Iranian government but that it was all part of a ploy to ultimately work as a double agent for Britain, a scheme he developed from watching the TV show \"Homeland.\"",
      "The BBC reported that he was cleared of perpetrating a\u00a0bomb hoax at his army barracks at RAF Stafford\u00a0in 2023, after three wired cannisters were left at the base where he lived and worked.",
      "Authorities said he presented a true risk to national security because of the threat that Iran poses. Police noted that the U.K. has disrupted 20 plots by Iran, including assassination plans.",
      "British security services were not aware of Khalife's contacts with the Iranians until he contacted MI6, the U.K.'s foreign intelligence service, to offer to work as a double agent.",
      "He reached out to MI6 anonymously, saying he had earned the trust of his Iranian handlers and that they had rewarded him by leaving $2,000 cash ($1,578 pounds) in a dog poo bag in a north London park.",
      "Khalife joined the army at 16 and was assigned to the Royal Corps of Signals, a communications unit that is deployed with battlefield troops, as well as special forces and intelligence squads.",
      "He was told he could not join the intelligence service because his mother is from Iran.",
      "At 17, he reached out to a man connected with Iranian intelligence and began passing along information, prosecutors said. He was given NATO secret security clearance when he took part in a joint exercise at Fort Cavazos in Texas in early 2021.",
      "The judge noted that his security breaches while on U.S. soil could have caused diplomatic damage.",
      "Khalife's escape from the Victorian-era prison drew attention to larger failures in the nation's aging and overcrowded correctional system. An inquiry is currently underway into how Khalife was able to escape and whether others helped.",
      "An audit found 81 security failings at the prison, the BBC reported. It also resulted in upgrades being made to CCTV cameras which had not worked for more than a year, the prison's Independent Monitoring Board said.",

And she had already previously dealt with a fire. And so we were kind of looking forward to the water, and it ended up happening again.\"",
      "\"And I actually followed up with her, and she'd acknowledged that before this fire occurred, a pipe had burst and water had flooded down over her bed shortly after she met with me,\" Henry continued. \"So I was like, \u2018The prophecy is fulfilled, right?\u2019 She's had a fire in the past. She's got the water. Well, then this happened, and it was very much attributed as a prediction, even if it wasn't exactly that. But it definitely was tuning into events that occurred.\"",

      "\"She has such a humble and resilient, altruistic approach,\" Henry said of Lake. \"And I was just so taken aback. I mean, this is something that she put her blood, sweat and tears in \u2014 her home. She went to so much effort to make hers and then to see that gone in an instant. I would not have been as strong as she was.\"",
      "\"She truly is so inspiring,\" he continued. \"And, you know, she is focused on the future, which I think is really, at this point, all we can do. This experience widely has spoken to what we can control and what we can't. And these readings demonstrate, you know, we can only really focus on what we can control and have to pray for the ability to discern the difference.\"",

But it is very difficult sometimes to not break down, to not, you know, kind of freak out. And it just brings up so many questions \u2014 existential questions.

      "He added, \"That said, Affleck is deliberate in his public appearances\u2014in some cases to support his friends and long-time collaborators, like Matt Damon, but in other cases to avoid controversy and conjecture, due to an unintended red carpet cross-over with his ex, Jennifer Lopez.

      "Eldridge also noted that as a woman, Lopez may be under more pressure to appear in public than her ex. \"Additionally, in a very archaic way, an actress must remain visible, in order to remain viable, in Hollywood,\" he explained. \"When was the last time you saw [Chris] Hemsworth, [Tom] Hardy or Harrison Ford, walking a red carpet for a project they weren't tied to?

      "He added, \"Let\u2019s keep the cameras rolling and the economy growing\u2014because everything\u2019s bigger (and better) in Texas!\"",
      "Productions like the Taylor Sheridan-created series \"Yellowstone\" and its spinoffs \"1883,\" \"1923\" and \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves,\" starring Quaid, have all filmed in Texas, as well as his latest series, \"Landman,\" starring Thornton, with its story set in the state\u2019s oil industry.",
      "Last week, the Texas senate announced that it had filed a budget that includes $498 million to revamp the state\u2019s film incentives, \"making Texas the movie capital of the world\" per the office of Lt. Governor Dan Patrick\u2019s press release. The budget consists of \"$48 million in grants for small films and TV commercials, and up to $450 million in new tax credits, including Texas residency requirements for workers.\"",

      "Filming in Los Angeles dropped to a historic low in 2024, down 5.6 percent from the previous year, per a report from FilmLA, the city\u2019s film office, making it the least productive year on their record, second only to 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns. The report cited, \"combined effects of runaway production, industry contraction and slower-than-hoped-for post-strike recovery\" as the reason for the low numbers.",
      "The devastating fires that broke out in early January have also contributed to worry about the state of production in the city, prompting a petition called \"Stay in LA.\"",

The fires have made a desperate situation worse. We are terrified that the city we love so much may lose its most vital resource:\u00a0its people. We need a flood of new work to help our beloved city rebuild itself and ensure LA's future viability as a place where craftspeople, film workers, and businesses thrive,\" the organization, started by Alexandra Pechman and Sarah Adina Smith, states on their page.",
      "The petition asks state government leadership to uncap tax incentives for the next three years for productions filming in Los Angeles County and asks studios and streamers to pledge to film 10% more in the city over that same time period. It also praised Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s proposal to increase California\u2019s own tax incentives for filming to $750 million.",
      "Among those are celebrities like Keanu Reeves, Kevin Bacon, Olivia Wilde and many, many more being added every day, according to Deadline.",

There [are] just a lot of prohibitive regulations and things in the way that I think could be lifted. . . . But I think it can be fixed.\"",
      "\"I know Newsom gave some tax incentives, but maybe not enough, because it's still not working. There are other things that offset that,\" he added later."

      "Super Bowl LIX is set to take place this Sunday at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans and is expected to draw a record-breaking audience of 116.8 million viewers. While this massive event generates excitement, it also attracts cybercriminals looking to exploit unsuspecting fans. Here are four common ways hackers target football fans leading up to the big game.",

      "Scam tactic #1: Mobile phishing and payment app scams",
      "Cybercriminals will try to exploit the Super Bowl's reliance on digital ticketing and mobile apps. Fans may receive text messages or social media alerts that appear to be from official payment apps, urging them to \"confirm\" their information for last-minute ticket upgrades or exclusive merchandise deals. These phishing attempts could lead to fake websites designed to steal banking details.",
      "HOW TO SCORE A GREAT DEAL ON A TV BEFORE THE SUPER BOWL",
      "Scam tactic #2: Pay-to-play scams",
      "Scammers create fake \"exclusive raffles\" or contests, claiming fans have a chance to win VIP tickets or unique experiences if they pay a small entry fee. These scams often rely on urgency and the fear of missing out. The Better Business Bureau has warned about fraudulent sports betting apps encouraging users to place \"guaranteed bets on upcoming games.\"",

      "Scoring last-minute Super Bowl tickets can feel like a victory until you find out they are fake. Sketchy ticket resellers flood search results and social media with deals that seem too good to be true. Online ticket fraud is becoming increasingly common. While some tickets may be legitimate, many are not, with fans spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars for nothing.",
      "Scammers often utilize automation and artificial intelligence to identify and target potential victims based on the language used in their posts. For instance, scammers search for popular buzzwords and hashtags that people use when looking to buy tickets, such as #SuperBowl, #SuperBowlTickets or #LookingForTickets. They then respond to these posts with messages that contain links to other platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram or Cash App, where they attempt to finalize fraudulent deals.",

      "If a social media ad is offering free NFL tickets or merchandise, there is a catch. These scams appear everywhere, promising fans exclusive giveaways if they cover a small shipping fee or provide personal details. The posts look official, sometimes even using fake endorsements from players or teams, making them easy to fall for.",
      "Scammers also use cross-platform operations to evade detection and bans by social media platforms. They will identify and initiate communications with you on one social media platform before requesting you switch to another. This is likely an attempt to prevent one social media platform from gaining full insight into fraudulent activity and banning accounts.",
      "The moment you enter your information or payment details, you have handed cybercriminals access to your bank account. And those free tickets or jerseys never arrive. Scammers rely on the excitement of game day to push people into acting without thinking. The truth is simple. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.",
      "Scam tactic #5: Offering massive discounts",
      "Finally, scammers may offer massive discounts for Super Bowl tickets to entice you to buy quickly. They may state they just want to sell the tickets \"last minute\" to justify large, attractive discounts, such as 50% off or more. They may also claim to have a personal or professional reason for not being able to attend the event, such as a family emergency or a work conflict. Scammers often use these excuses to pressure victims into making hasty decisions and transferring money without verifying the tickets.",

      "MOST TALKED ABOUT SUPER BOWL ADS",
      "Safeguarding your Super Bowl experience from cyber threats",
      "While scammers will try to prey on Super Bowl fans, you are not completely helpless. Dave Lewis, Global Advisory CISO at\u00a01Password, shared some tips on staying safe leading up to the games. These are not complicated strategies, just simple cybersecurity practices that are easy to follow.",
      "1) Buy tickets from trusted sources:\u00a0Only purchase from official sites/apps and other reputable channels. Double-check URLs to avoid lookalike sites (which are designed to mimic legitimate event pages). Platforms like Facebook Marketplace, Eventbrite and Nextdoor are also hot spots for scams, so be cautious of sellers \"requiring a deposit\" through peer-to-peer financial apps like Cash App, Venmo or Zelle.",
      "2) Watch out for event-related phishing attacks: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Cybercriminals often time their phishing attacks around large events like the Super Bowl, offering fake discount tickets, VIP experiences, free food vouchers, etc. Always verify offers through the event\u2019s official website or app and never agree to anything over the phone. Double-check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over links before clicking to ensure they lead to legitimate event sites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Keep your phone software and apps updated:\u00a0Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system (i.e., iOS, macOS, Windows, Android, others). \"While constant notifications can be an annoyance at the moment, these updates are essential for keeping your devices secure,\" Lewis said. If you\u2019re not sure how to get started,\u00a0check out this extensive guide on how to update all your devices.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Create complex passwords for all your accounts, especially those related to ticket purchases or event information. Use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store these securely. Enable\u00a02FA wherever possible, particularly for email and payment accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. For the Super Bowl, this is especially crucial for any official NFL or ticketing apps you might be using.",
      "5) Be wary of QR codes:\u00a0While convenient, QR codes can be exploited by hackers for malicious purposes. Only scan QR codes from trusted sources, such as the official event organizer. If unsure, check for signs of tampering, like stickers placed over legitimate codes or poor print quality. When in doubt, don\u2019t scan it. As a precaution, always keep your antivirus software running to prevent malware infections from scanning a scam QR code.\u00a0If you don\u2019t have antivirus software, check out my top recommendations here.",
      "6) Beware of scammers using social engineering techniques: For example, they may encourage you to transfer money immediately as they allegedly have other prospective buyers. They may also use emotional appeals, such as sympathy, guilt or urgency, to manipulate you into making a decision. Scammers often use these tactics to pressure victims into paying before verifying the tickets.",
      "7) Be wary of individuals showing receipts or proof of purchase: This is not a guarantee that an individual is in possession of a ticket, and it can be easily faked.\u00a0Scammers can use fake receipts to convince victims that they bought the tickets from legitimate sources, such as Ticketmaster, StubHub or SeatGeek.",
      "8) Exercise caution when interacting with individuals asking for you to \"name your price\" or are selling below ticket value: This may be a sign that they are trying to lure you into a scam with a too-good-to-be-true offer. Scammers often use this strategy to attract victims who are looking for cheap or affordable tickets.",
      "9)\u00a0Be cautious when interacting with people claiming to sell tickets on behalf of a friend or family member: This may provide an excuse for scammers using compromised bank accounts with the account holder's name different from the social media account being used. Scammers often use this pretext to explain the discrepancy between the names on the accounts.",
      "10)\u00a0Review the account\u2019s recent history: Some scammers may claim to be selling tickets to multiple high-profile events, such as sports games, music concerts and conferences at one time. This may indicate that they are running a large-scale scam operation and are not genuine sellers. Scammers often post multiple ads for different events on the same or different platforms, using the same or similar images and descriptions.",
      "11) Exercise caution and validate ownership: Do this even when purchasing items from friends or friends of friends on social media. A family member or friend\u2019s account can be compromised and used by a scammer. Friends of the victim can vouch for the account user as a legitimate seller, not realizing the account had been hacked.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are always looking for new ways to take advantage of football fans, especially during major events like the Super Bowl. Whether it is fake ticket sales, phishing scams or bogus giveaways, the risks are real. You can easily avoid becoming a victim of these types of attacks by staying vigilant and being cautious of emails and links that ask for personal information.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Feb 2025 10:00:55 -0500",
    "summary": "A new scam using Elon Musk&apos;s name is making the rounds, promoting &quot;energy-saving&quot; devices and falsely linking the Tesla and SpaceX leader to the products.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says cybercriminals are exploiting iMessage phishing protection, tricking users to reactivate links.",
      "Elon Musk, known for leading companies like Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and xAI and buying and rebranding Twitter as X, often finds his name linked to innovation and futuristic ideas. But his reputation also makes him a prime target for scammers.",
      "In the past, fraudsters have used Musk\u2019s name in cryptocurrency schemes. Now, a new scam is making the rounds. This time, scammers are promoting bogus \"energy-saving\" devices, falsely associating Musk with these products to gain credibility. These devices, which don\u2019t work as advertised, are being marketed as revolutionary solutions, duping people into spending money on what is essentially a scam.",
      "We received this email from Rick in Wilkesboro, North Carolina: \"I\u2019ve been receiving emails offering an energy-saving device developed by Elon Musk. It claims the device can reduce energy bills by 50%. I never attempted to contact anyone associated with Elon Musk, nor have I done any internet searches for such a device. Are these emails legit or another attempt by scammers hoping I click on their links?\"",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "Rick, it sounds like those emails are likely scams. There have been numerous reports of scammers using Elon Musk's name to promote fake energy-saving devices. These scams often claim that the device can drastically reduce energy bills, but there is no evidence that Elon Musk or any of his companies are involved in such products.",
      "Let's dive into how this scam works and share some ways you can stay safe.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does Elon Musk's energy-saving scam work?",
      "The Elon Musk energy-saving scam works by using flashy online ads, unsolicited emails and other deceptive tactics to lure victims. Scammers promote so-called \"revolutionary\" devices through social media, pop-ups, emails and even search engine ads, claiming the products are backed by Musk.",
      "These ads often include fake customer reviews, exaggerated claims of slashing electricity bills by 50% or more and time-limited discounts to create urgency. Names of devices advertised in these scams include the Power Pro Save, Heunwa Power Save, Stop Watt, Miracle Watt, True Watt, Real Watt, Watt Rescue, Esaver Watt, Pro Power Save, Voltmod and more.",
      "Clicking on these ads leads you to sales websites designed to look legitimate. They feature fake logos, doctored before-and-after photos and bogus celebrity endorsements to build trust. The sites throw around pseudo-scientific jargon like \"stabilizing electrical currents\" or \"rebalancing loads\" to sound convincing. They also use tactics like showing inflated \"regular\" prices crossed out to make the current offer seem like a huge bargain.",
      "If you look closely, though, the red flags are clear. These sites lack basic details like a company address, contact number or business registration information. Instead, they push you to place an order through an online form, demanding full payment upfront via credit card or PayPal.",
      "After paying, customers might receive a cheap, non-functional plastic device, or sometimes nothing at all. These devices don\u2019t reduce electricity usage. They might even waste more power. But by the time you realize it, the scammers have already pocketed your money.",
      "Elon Musk scam email ads (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON\u2019T CLICK THAT LINK! HOW TO SPOT AND PREVENT PHISHING ATTACKS IN YOUR INBOX",
      "The truth about energy-saving devices",
      "Over the years, plenty of power-saving scams have promised to cut down or even eliminate your electricity bill by simply plugging in their devices. The reality is that there\u2019s no device you can plug in that will actually reduce your electricity usage or lower your household bill.",
      "These products often claim to \"stabilize voltage\" or \"reduce power waste.\" While voltage stabilization can be useful in industrial settings, it doesn\u2019t make much difference for typical home appliances. Most household appliances are already designed to run efficiently without the issues these devices claim to fix.",
      "If you\u2019re serious about saving on electricity, focus on\u00a0practical solutions like upgrading to energy-efficient appliances, using smart home devices or adjusting your energy usage schedule.",

      "Too good to be true: Claims of reducing energy bills by 50% or more are often exaggerated and unrealistic.",
      "Unsolicited emails: Receiving emails out of the blue, especially when you haven't shown interest in such products, is a common tactic used by scammers.",
      "Use of celebrity names: Scammers frequently use well-known names like Elon Musk to lend credibility to their schemes.",
      "Suspicious links: Be cautious of clicking on links in unsolicited emails. They can lead to phishing sites designed to steal your personal information. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "10 ways to stay safe from such scams",
      "1. Verify the email: Phishing emails are a common tool scammers use to trick people into buying fake products or giving away personal information. These emails often look like they\u2019re from legitimate sources, but they contain links that lead to fraudulent websites or prompt you to download malicious attachments. Always check the sender's email address and look for signs of a fake message, like poor grammar or urgent calls to action.",
      "2. Verify claims: If you're curious about a product, do some research from reputable sources before taking any action.",
      "3. Do not click links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from these emails. Instead, hover over the link to see its true destination. This can help you identify if it leads to a legitimate site or a malicious one.",
      "4. Have strong antivirus software actively running on your devices: Ensure you have reliable antivirus software installed on your devices. Antivirus software helps protect your devices from malware, viruses and other security threats. Regularly update the software to ensure it can detect and remove the latest threats. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Examine the website carefully: Scammers often create websites that look professional, but they\u2019re easy to spot with a few simple checks. Look for missing or suspicious information, like the absence of a business address, phone number or business registration details. If there are fake testimonials or celebrity endorsements, that\u2019s a red flag.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "6. Don\u2019t fall for \"too good to be true\" deals:\u00a0Scammers rely on offering deals that seem too good to pass up, like massive discounts or a \"limited time offer.\" If an ad claims you can save 50% or more on a product, be skeptical. Real, quality products usually don\u2019t come with such extreme savings, and high-tech devices like those promoted by scammers rarely live up to the hype. If it feels like too good a deal, it probably is.",
      "7. Watch out for unusual payment methods: One of the easiest ways to spot a scam is by how the scammers ask you to pay. If a website asks for payment upfront via credit card or PayPal with no option to verify or ship the product first, it's a major red flag. Scammers take your money upfront and have no intention of sending you anything of value. Stick to reputable payment methods that offer buyer protection and avoid sites that ask for payment without proper verification.",
      "8. Mark spam email as junk or spam: Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "9. Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources: This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable email or email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "10. Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Impersonation scams are a common way scammers steal your money. They often use well-known names like Elon Musk or big companies like Microsoft and Walmart to make you trust them, then trick you into giving away your financial details. To stay safe, avoid unsolicited emails or texts that promote products or offers. If you need to buy something, stick to trusted sellers like Amazon, Best Buy or other reputable platforms. Always double-check the legitimacy of any offer before making a purchase, especially if it comes from an unfamiliar source.",

In contrast, Android\u2019s openness allows users to install apps from various sources, and updates are often rolled out at different times, making it more vulnerable to attacks.",
      "However, iPhones aren\u2019t immune to security flaws. Hackers occasionally find ways to exploit them, as seen in Apple\u2019s latest advisory. The company recently discovered that a vulnerability in iOS had been exploited for over a year.

      "Apple has\u00a0uncovered hackers exploiting a vulnerability in iOS that appears to have been lingering for more than a year. The vulnerability is a \"zero-day\" flaw, meaning criminals may have already exploited it, according to the latest security advisory from the company. Zero-day flaws like this are especially dangerous because they are exploited before developers can issue fixes. Apple confirmed this marks its first zero-day patch of 2025. The vulnerability affects iPhones dating back to 2018\u2019s XS model, as well as newer iPads, Macs, and even the Vision Pro headset.",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24085, resides in Apple\u2019s Core Media framework, a software layer responsible for processing multimedia files. A \"use after free\" memory corruption error enabled hackers to manipulate the system into executing unstable code, granting them elevated privileges to bypass security protocols. Apple\u2019s advisory suggests hackers weaponized the flaw through malicious apps disguised as legitimate media players. These apps likely abused the Core Media framework by triggering corrupted files, enabling attackers to infiltrate devices.",
      "The attacks reportedly targeted iOS versions predating 17.2, released in December 2023, meaning the vulnerability may have been active since late 2022. Security experts speculate that hackers focused on high-value individuals \u2014 such as activists, executives or journalists \u2014 to avoid detection.

      "2. Download apps only from the App Store: To minimize the risk of installing malware, only download apps from the official App Store. Apple\u2019s strict app review process helps prevent malicious apps from being published, but some threats can still slip through. Always verify app details, check reviews and be cautious about app permissions before installation.",
      "3. Enable lockdown mode for extra protection: For those of you who may be at higher risk, such as journalists or executives,\u00a0Lockdown Mode provides an additional layer of security. This feature limits certain device functionalities to prevent sophisticated cyberattacks. It can be turned on via\u00a0Settings >\u00a0Privacy & Security >\u00a0Lockdown Mode and is especially useful for those concerned about targeted threats.",
      "4. Enable message filtering: Use your device's built-in filtering options to sort messages from unknown senders. This feature allows you to automatically sort messages from unknown senders, easily filter unread messages\u00a0and manage your message inbox more efficiently. Here are steps:",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Review your security and privacy settings: Regularly reviewing your iPhone\u2019s security settings can help you maintain strong protection. You should also review app permissions in\u00a0Settings > Privacy & Security to restrict access to sensitive data, such as location or contacts. Enable\u00a0Face ID or Touch ID for secure access and turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) for Apple ID and other accounts.\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message or authentication app, in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: By reducing your online footprint, you make it harder for cybercriminals to obtain your contact information, potentially preventing them from sending you deceptive phishing texts and emails in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

If you\u2019re using an iPhone from 2018 or later, make sure you\u2019ve updated to iOS 17.2 or later as soon as possible.

They [the U.S.] are already there, and they can have more possibilities. And at the same time, we are willing to scale up from the Kingdom of Denmark. And I think NATO is the same.

      "\"Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s historic visit to Washington will mark a significant moment in Israel-U.S. relations, setting a tone of close cooperation and friendship between the Israeli government and the Trump administration,\" Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told Fox News Digital.",

      "Leiter, appearing on \"America's Newsroom\" last week, told Dana Perino that Iran would be front and center during the Trump-Netanyahu meeting. \"We will make the point that to allow Tehran to maintain its nuclear capabilities, which they can raise very quickly toward nuclear weapons, is simply unacceptable,\" he stated.",
      "Netanyahu was last at the White House on July 25, 2024, with then-President Biden having only invited the Israeli leader some 20 months after his re-election. This was widely viewed as a snub by Biden, whose party has increasingly distanced itself from traditional bipartisan support for the Jewish state.",
      "Netanyahu told reporters ahead of his departure that it was \"telling\" Trump chose to meet him first, describing it as \"a testimony to the strength of the American-Israeli alliance.\"",
      "\"This meeting will deal with important issues, critical issues facing Israel and our region, victory over Hamas, achieving the release of all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian terror axis and all its components \u2013 an axis that threatens the peace of Israel, the Middle East and the entire world,\" he said.",
      "There are currently 79 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including six dual US-Israeli citizens. \"Regarding agenda terms, Trump will want Netanyahu to proceed to the second phase of the truce agreement with Hamas. This is very difficult for Israel, since this basically leaves the terror group in power in Gaza,\" former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Michael Oren told Fox News Digital.",

      "While Trump has said he was \"not confident\" the ceasefire deal would hold, his Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff visited Israel last week and reportedly pushed for the implementation of all three phases. According to Netanyahu, Trump has committed to supporting the resumption of the war if negotiations with Hamas prove \"futile.\"",
      "\"There may also be discussion about the future of the Palestinian issue and ways in which the Trump peace plan unveiled during his first term can be revived, as well as how a normalization push between Israel and Saudi Arabia can be concluded,\" Oren said. \"I think the major pressure point would be the \u2018P\u2019 word, which refers to the Saudis insisting on a pathway to Palestinian statehood. Parts of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and even some within his own party will not discuss the \u2018P\u2019 word.\"",

      "\"If not, the Iranians will be subject to a major operation that may be through an American-led coalition or different structures with or without Israel,\" he added, while referencing an Axios report last month that the U.S. president might \"either support an Israeli military strike against Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities\u2026 or even order a U.S. strike.\" However, Ayalon said Trump will express a preference for a diplomatic solution, possibly placing him at odds with Netanyahu.",

      "\"A potential economic corridor from Asia to Europe through Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, maybe even the Palestinian Authority, works very well with Trump\u2019s agenda of countering aggressive Chinese expansionism through the Belt and Road Initiative,\" Ayalon said.",
      "Other agenda items might include a possible U.S.-backed push to apply Israeli sovereignty over parts of the West Bank, also known by Israel as Judea and Samaria \u2013 a prospect Netanyahu shelved during Trump\u2019s first term in favor of forging the Abraham Accords \u2013 and expanding overall defense ties, including by advancing the American president\u2019s goal of developing an Iron Dome-like missile shield for the United States.",

Trump sees the problem of Gaza in a wider perspective\" that includes the Saudis, Qataris, Egyptians and other regional players, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Hannan Gefen, the former commander of IDF's elite Unit 8200, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Trump, in his second term, is repeating his willingness to withdraw from the Kurdish-controlled northeastern part of Syria, which may contrast with Israel\u2019s interest,\" he explained. \"In Lebanon, there might be a disagreement if Israel sees Hezbollah [violating the ceasefire and] regaining power, and wants to strike terror bases.

      "Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital, \"It is clear that Hezbollah has had a massive opposition to its military presence in Lebanon at least since May 2008 when they invaded half of the capital and parts of the mountain to bring down the government of the \u2018Cedars revolution\u2019 after the Syrian withdrawal in 2005.\"",

      "Many have linked his situation to Trump\u2019s and blamed the government for jailing the popular former prime minister. Khan\u2019s plight has also been highlighted by longtime Trump ally and adviser Richard Grenell, who took to social media late last year when he tweeted, \"Free Imran Khan!\"",
      "A Pakistani court sentenced Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to 14 and seven years in jail after finding them guilty of corruption. They were convicted for allegedly accepting land as a bribe through the Al-Qadir Trust, which they had set up while Khan was in office.

      "In response to Fox News Digital questions about Khan's conviction, Pakistan's federal minister for information and broadcasting, Ata Ullah TararIn, defended Khan's conviction. \"The 190 million pound case is one of the biggest corruption cases in the history of Pakistan, and it is a mega scam in which former Prime Minister Imran Khan, and his wife, Bushra Bibi, have been found to be guilty. There is irrefutable evidence that they not only used the official position to grant illegal favor to a property tycoon, but they also received gratification and formed a sham trust in order to grant this favor to a property tycoon.\"",
      "He continued, \"This is corruption of the highest order, and the former prime minister has been convicted on the basis of irrefutable evidence of corruption and this, this scam, which is the biggest scam in the history of Pakistan, has reached its legal conclusion.\"",

Khan noted the parallels between himself and Trump, saying the two shared similar experiences. \"The world today needs steadfast leadership that champions peace, democracy, and human rights, and I hope that his leadership can contribute to that vision\".",
      "Trump's and Khan's experiences with the authorities share are a key similarity, but their stories mirror each other in ways that go beyond just that.",
      "While Trump transformed the U.S. political scene with his \"Make America Great Again\" movement, Khan energized Pakistanis with his \"Naya Pakistan\" (New Pakistan) vision. And in a manner similar to Trump, Khan did away with the elitism of politics, focusing on the average person instead.",

Since Trump's return to office, the South Asian nation has been buzzing with speculation and hope over whether he will force Khan's release. The two have a friendly relationship, with Trump calling Khan \"a very good friend of mine\" at a 2020 forum in Davos. The two first met in Washington in July 2019, which at the time was considered a reset for U.S.-Pakistan relations.",

      "\"Economic diplomacy will be central to my approach. Pakistan is rich in natural resources, yet we have barely scratched the surface of our potential in agriculture, industrialization, and IT,\" Khan stated. \"These sectors hold immense promise, both domestically and globally.\"",

      "Explaining his aspirations, Khan concluded, \"Rather than relying on handouts, we must focus on self-sufficiency and leveraging our strengths to build sustainable economic relationships.

      "Khan's message to his supporters and foes alike, \"The people of Pakistan have never been more awake or more determined. They see with clarity what is happening to their nation, and they understand the forces at play.\u00a0I firmly believe that truth and justice will ultimately prevail. And as long as I have breath, I will continue to fight for this cause and for a Pakistan that reflects the will and aspirations of its people.\"",

      "The site also reached Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association, who learned about it Tuesday evening when a federal health worker sent it to him.",
      "\u201cThis is a scare tactic to try to intimidate people who are trying to do their work and do it admirably,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear racism.\u201d",
      "A government worker said they found out theirs was among the names on the website Tuesday afternoon after a former co-worker sent them the link on social media.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unnerving,\u201d said the person, who requested anonymity because of safety concerns. \u201cMy name and my picture is there, and in 2025, it\u2019s very simple to Google and look up someone\u2019s home address and all kinds of things that potentially put me at risk.\u201d",

HHS oversees federal health agencies, including the CDC and\u00a0the National Institutes of Health.",

    "summary": "A federal judge weighed in Tuesday on a long-brewing legal feud between billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman over OpenAI, suggesting she\u2019s unlikely to halt the company\u2019s plan to restructure for now.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge weighed in Tuesday on a long-brewing legal feud between billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman over OpenAI, the company they co-founded, suggesting she\u2019s unlikely to halt the company\u2019s plan to restructure for now.",
      "Musk, a top ally to President Donald Trump and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is looking to stop the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence AI developer from becoming a for-profit company. He has accused OpenAI of becoming a \u201cclosed source, profit-maximizer,\u201d and he sued the company last year, first in a California court and later in federal court.",
      "In a courtroom in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that \u201cit is a stretch [for Musk] to claim irreparable harm in this case,\u201d adding that it\u2019s a battle of \u201cbillionaires versus billionaires.\u201d",
      "Musk is requesting a preliminary injunction, which would stall OpenAI\u2019s conversion. Gonzalez Rogers didn\u2019t immediately rule on the matter.",
      "Musk, who didn\u2019t appear at the hearing Tuesday, was among a handful of co-founders of OpenAI in 2015. He invested $45 million in the startup between then and 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday. But he and Altman had a falling out, with much of their feud publicly playing out online. In 2023, Musk launched xAI \u2014 his own rival to OpenAI \u2014 further escalating the tension between them. Musk added xAI as a plaintiff in the case last year.",
      "U.S. companies continue to rush to invest in AI infrastructure and development, alongside recent innovations from China that have shaken AI developers and investors alike. Last month, Altman joined Trump at the White House, where Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed \u201cStargate.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Musk accused OpenAI and Microsoft of improperly agreeing to limit competition, effectively creating monopoly-like conditions that would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act.\u00a0OpenAI\u2019s attorneys denied the existence of any such agreement.",
      "OpenAI is \u201ca charity where a tiny trickle goes to the charity. It all goes to the for-profit enterprise,\u201d Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said. \u201cWhen you look at that, it\u2019s a cumulative effect in a nascent industry where OpenAI \u2014\u00a0already with 70% of the market, in conjunction with Microsoft \u2014 is seeking to strangle their competitors in the crib.\u201d",
      "OpenAI began its operations as a nonprofit research lab before it transitioned to a so-called capped profit model in 2019, which allowed it to function more like a startup, with the nonprofit arm controlling its for-profit arm.",
      "In December, the company announced it would pivot toward a new for-profit structure this year, which entails creating a public benefit corporation \u2014 a type of for-profit company that aims to make a \u201cpositive impact\u201d on society \u2014 to raise more capital to compete with the \u201chundreds of\u2060 billions of\u2060 dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development.\u201d",
      "For OpenAI, that \u201cpublic benefit\u201d mission is the pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or the possibility of building AI that can essentially think for itself.",
      "Still, others in tech have also expressed opposition to OpenAI\u2019s conversion to a for-profit entity. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, reportedly sent California Attorney General Rob Bonta a letter in December asking the state to block it from doing so,\u00a0according to The Wall Street Journal. In December, the nonprofit AI safety organization\u00a0Encode backed Musk\u2019s suit in a statement.",
      "Sarah Eddy, an attorney for OpenAI, stood by the company\u2019s decision, telling the judge that it would be \u201ceconomically irrational for investors to invest only in OpenAI, even if that were happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are plenty of reasons ... for investors to be selecting one investment vehicle rather than the other,\" she said Tuesday.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s attorneys also argued that Musk previously supported its becoming a for-profit entity.",
      "Last year, OpenAI alleged that Musk agreed in late 2017 that the \u201cnext step for the mission was to create a for-profit entity,\u201d adding that he wanted \u201cmajority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO.\u201d Later, when Musk sued OpenAI, it released emails that purport to show Musk telling Altman and several others: \u201cEven raising several hundred million won\u2019t be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it.\u201d",
      "Musk hasn\u2019t publicly addressed OpenAI\u2019s allegations.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers said Musk can present his arguments to a jury when the case goes to trial.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened, but I certainly am not throwing something out on a motion to dismiss when it is plausible that what Mr. Musk is saying is true,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out, he\u2019ll sit on the stand, he\u2019ll present it to a jury. A jury will decide who is right. So something\u2019s going to trial.\u201d"

      "Gaiman, a British writer now living in Wisconsin, has written nearly 50 books, many of which have been adapted for film and TV, including \u201cThe Sandman\u201d and \u201cCoraline.\u201d Palmer, who lives in upstate New York, made her mark as part of the punk cabaret duo The Dresden Dolls. The two announced they were getting divorced in 2022.",
      "Gaiman previously denied allegations made by accusers in a\u00a0statement on his website last month. \u201cI\u2019m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever,\u201d he wrote.",
      "He said he regrets being \u201cobviously careless with people\u2019s hearts and feelings,\u201d calling it \u201cselfish.\u201d But \u201c[s]ome of the horrible stories now being told simply never happened, while others have been so distorted from what actually took place that they bear no relationship to reality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Before the lawsuit was filed, Palmer posted on Instagram that she could not comment, \u201cas there are ongoing custody and divorce proceedings.\u201d The couple, who married in 2011, have one child together.",
      "Gaiman and Palmer did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Neither has publicly commented on the recent lawsuits.",
      "The lawsuit says: \u201cGaiman engaged in many nonconsensual sex acts with Scarlett. Those acts were abusive and demeaning. ... Scarlett endured those acts because she would lose her job, housing, and promised future career support if she did not.\u201d",
      "Palmer played a role in \u201cprocuring and presenting\u201d Pavlovich to her husband, according to court documents. \u201cMore than a dozen women, including several former employees, had previously come to Palmer about abusive sexual encounters with Gaiman,\u201d\u00a0the lawsuit says.",
      "Pavlovich \u201chad nowhere to go\u201d and would have been homeless if she left, according to the lawsuit, which describes Pavlovich as the couple\u2019s \u201ceconomic hostage.\u201d",
      "\u201cScarlett knew that she had only two choices: she could either submit to Gaiman\u2019s coercion and violence or she could try to escape,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "When Pavlovich met the couple, it says, she was penniless and \u201csleeping on the beach.\u201d Pavlovich, who is lesbian, was also grappling with \u201csubstantial mental health difficulties.\u201d Pavlovich had also been raped at age 15 by a middle-age man, the suit says.",
      "Palmer was aware of her history, Pavlovich said in the court documents.",
      "Pavlovich said she was at Gaiman\u2019s house in New Zealand when the first sexual assault happened on Feb. 4, 2022. She said that Gaiman, who was 61 at the time, called her his \u201cslave\u201d and that the assaults continued until she told Palmer she would kill herself and was hospitalized.",
      "\u201cSome incidents took place in the presence of Gaiman and Palmer\u2019s child,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "After Pavlovich was released from the hospital, the papers say, Gaiman paid her for the babysitting she had done and helped cover her rent for a few months.",
      "Pavlovich alleged that when she reported the rapes to the police, she thought Palmer would back up her charges, because she \u201chad expressed disgust for what Gaiman had done, calling him \u2018Weinstein\u2019 and predicting he would be inevitably \u2018MeTooed\u2019.\u201d",
      "\u201cHer hope was in vain,\u201d the papers say. \u201cThe police took no action because Palmer refused to talk to them.\u201d",
      "Gaiman has experienced some professional fallout since the allegations surfaced last year. Dark Horse Comics said on X last month that it would no longer publish his works. A planned movie adaptation of one of his books was reportedly put on pause."

      "Maitland police officers came upon a blue Lamborghini stuck in railroad tracks near Greenwood Drive and Mechanic Street at about 1:14 a.m., according to an affidavit supporting Jordan's arrest.",
      "The officers were told that the car had fled from an attempted traffic stop by Seminole County sheriff's deputies minutes earlier, the court document said.",
      "\u201cI stood at the window and immediately detected the odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the vehicle,\u201d an arresting officer wrote in the affidavit. \u201cThe defendant kept saying he made a wrong turn and needed assistance getting his vehicle off the railroad tracks.

      "\"You know trains come by right now, right?\u201d one officer says, to which Jordan replies that that's the reason they want to get the car off the tracks. The officer then asks the pair to get out of the vehicle because a train is coming in less than five minutes.",

      "Other officers arrive, with Jordan insisting they try to push the car out and police telling him that it's not possible. One officer tells him that he's concerned for everyone on the track, with Jordan replying, \u201cI mean, the concern is this $300,000 vehicle.\"",

    "story": [
      "When Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes takes the field for Super Bowl LIX on Sunday, he\u2019ll have an opportunity to do what no quarterback has done in NFL history: Win three Super Bowls in a row.",
      "The Chiefs\u2019 appearance in the game is a record in itself, as no team has made five Super Bowls in a six-year span before this season.",
      "While Kansas City has had several key contributors during this run \u2014 such as head coach Andy Reid, tight end Travis Kelce and defensive tackle Chris Jones, to name only a few \u2014 the team\u2019s success is spearheaded by Mahomes.",
      "The Chiefs drafted Mahomes in 2017 and made him their starting quarterback the next year. In that season, Mahomes threw 50 touchdowns and won MVP. Since he entered the league, Mahomes has won two MVPs, three Super Bowl MVPs and has made at least the AFC championship game in every season as a starter.",
      "Mahomes has lost only three times in 20 playoff games, and two of those have been at the hands of the consensus Greatest of All Time: New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady.",
      "Brady bested Mahomes in the 2018 AFC championship with the Patriots and then again with the Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV.",
      "When Brady \u2014 who, ironically, will be calling Sunday\u2019s game for Fox \u2014 retired, it felt as though it would take a very long time for any player to match his record seven Super Bowl rings. And yet, through the first eight seasons of his career, not only is Mahomes on pace with Brady in terms of championships \u2014 he has a chance to eclipse him.",
      "Take a look at Mahomes\u2019s stats through his first eight seasons compared with Brady\u2019s:",
      "As you can see, Mahomes has a clear edge over Brady in nearly every single statistical category relevant to quarterbacks. Some of that can be attributed to the eras each QB spent their first eight seasons in, though it also paints a picture as to how dominant and well-rounded Mahomes has been so far.",
      "Notably, these stats don\u2019t include Sunday\u2019s game, which means Mahomes actually has a chance to pull ahead of Brady\u2019s Super Bowl pace. If the Chiefs win Super Bowl LIX, Mahomes will have four championships in his first eight seasons compared to Brady\u2019s three.",
      "One more win alone may not be enough to make Mahomes the GOAT. But regardless of the result on Sunday, Mahomes\u2019s case for the title is stacking up nicely as enters the next eight years of his career."

    "story": [
      "A federal judge weighed in Tuesday on a long-brewing legal feud between billionaires Elon Musk and Sam Altman over OpenAI, the company they co-founded, suggesting she\u2019s unlikely to halt the company\u2019s plan to restructure for now.",
      "Musk, a top ally to President Donald Trump and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, is looking to stop the Microsoft-backed artificial intelligence AI developer from becoming a for-profit company. He has accused OpenAI of becoming a \u201cclosed source, profit-maximizer,\u201d and he sued the company last year, first in a California court and later in federal court.",
      "In a courtroom in Oakland, California, on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that \u201cit is a stretch [for Musk] to claim irreparable harm in this case,\u201d adding that it\u2019s a battle of \u201cbillionaires versus billionaires.\u201d",
      "Musk is requesting a preliminary injunction, which would stall OpenAI\u2019s conversion. Gonzalez Rogers didn\u2019t immediately rule on the matter.",
      "Musk, who didn\u2019t appear at the hearing Tuesday, was among a handful of co-founders of OpenAI in 2015. He invested $45 million in the startup between then and 2018, his lawyer said Tuesday. But he and Altman had a falling out, with much of their feud publicly playing out online. In 2023, Musk launched xAI \u2014 his own rival to OpenAI \u2014 further escalating the tension between them. Musk added xAI as a plaintiff in the case last year.",
      "U.S. companies continue to rush to invest in AI infrastructure and development, alongside recent innovations from China that have shaken AI developers and investors alike. Last month, Altman joined Trump at the White House, where Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure project dubbed \u201cStargate.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Musk accused OpenAI and Microsoft of improperly agreeing to limit competition, effectively creating monopoly-like conditions that would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act.\u00a0OpenAI\u2019s attorneys denied the existence of any such agreement.",
      "OpenAI is \u201ca charity where a tiny trickle goes to the charity. It all goes to the for-profit enterprise,\u201d Musk's attorney Marc Toberoff said. \u201cWhen you look at that, it\u2019s a cumulative effect in a nascent industry where OpenAI \u2014\u00a0already with 70% of the market, in conjunction with Microsoft \u2014 is seeking to strangle their competitors in the crib.\u201d",
      "OpenAI began its operations as a nonprofit research lab before it transitioned to a so-called capped profit model in 2019, which allowed it to function more like a startup, with the nonprofit arm controlling its for-profit arm.",
      "In December, the company announced it would pivot toward a new for-profit structure this year, which entails creating a public benefit corporation \u2014 a type of for-profit company that aims to make a \u201cpositive impact\u201d on society \u2014 to raise more capital to compete with the \u201chundreds of\u2060 billions of\u2060 dollars that major companies are now investing into AI development.\u201d",
      "For OpenAI, that \u201cpublic benefit\u201d mission is the pursuit of artificial general intelligence, or the possibility of building AI that can essentially think for itself.",
      "Still, others in tech have also expressed opposition to OpenAI\u2019s conversion to a for-profit entity. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, reportedly sent California Attorney General Rob Bonta a letter in December asking the state to block it from doing so,\u00a0according to The Wall Street Journal. In December, the nonprofit AI safety organization\u00a0Encode backed Musk\u2019s suit in a statement.",
      "Sarah Eddy, an attorney for OpenAI, stood by the company\u2019s decision, telling the judge that it would be \u201ceconomically irrational for investors to invest only in OpenAI, even if that were happening.\u201d",

    "title": "From lip balm to sneakers, here's how Trump's China tariffs could raise prices",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:11:18 GMT",
    "summary": "U.S. consumers could start seeing price hikes on a wide variety of goods made in China after the United States began collecting a 10% tariff Tuesday on all Chinese imports, reigniting a trade war between the two countries that\u2019s at risk of accelerating.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. consumers could start seeing price hikes on a wide variety of goods made in China after the United States began collecting a 10% tariff Tuesday on all Chinese imports, reigniting a trade war between the two countries that\u2019s at risk of accelerating.",
      "President Donald Trump said he was instituting the tariffs until China took action to reduce the flow of fentanyl into the United States. China responded by announcing plans to put its own tariffs next week on certain U.S. products, including coal, oil, agricultural machinery and pickup trucks.",
      "While the 10% tariff is smaller than the 60% tariff Trump had threatened during his campaign, investors and industry analysts expect the added cost to have a ripple effect across certain industries that rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing. It has also raised fears among retailers that it could be just the opening salvo in a prolonged tit-for-tat with China.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of uncertainty about how to price goods, because it\u2019s a 10% tariff now on top of whatever duties we\u2019re already paying, but what will it be a month from now or two months from now?\u201d said Matt Priest, president of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America. Priest said he was hearing a lot of confusion from companies at a trade show he was attending Tuesday in New York.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to confidently cost your goods without knowing where this duty plane will land,\u201d he said.",
      "Footwear",
      "With more than half of footwear sold in the United States coming from China, Priest said, consumers are likely to see an increase in shoe prices, though some of the cost will be absorbed by retailers and other businesses throughout the supply chain. The typical sneaker already has around a 20% tariff on it, including a 7.5% tariff added during Trump\u2019s last term. With the additional 10% tariff, a midrange sneaker could ultimately have $18 to $20 added to the total cost, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is a movie we\u2019ve seen before, and it doesn\u2019t bring jobs back to the U.S., and it does raise costs, so it\u2019s a challenge for us to see the end game or the point,\u201d Priest said. \u201cWe do want to work with the administration to tamp down inflation \u2014 that was the president\u2019s mandate, and we agree with it \u2014 but this is not the way to go about doing that.\u201d",
      "Tariffs are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods from China, such as retailers or wholesalers, when those goods arrive at U.S. ports. Those companies will then have to decide whether to pass the higher costs on to consumers by raising prices or absorb the cost by taking lower profits or trying to cut costs elsewhere.",
      "China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on around $24 billion worth of U.S. products could also have an impact on U.S. workers if companies see significant declines in sales from Chinese customers.",
      "China's countermoves",
      "China also said it was launching an antitrust investigation into Google and took aim at two other U.S. companies: gene sequencing maker Illumina Inc. and PVH Group, the owner of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands, placing them on a blacklist limiting their ability to sell their products there.",
      "But China\u2019s moves were more limited in scope than some companies had feared: They apply to around 14% of U.S. exports to China, while Trump\u2019s tariffs apply to all goods sold in the United States from China.",
      "That could be an effort by China to send a signal that it is willing to target specific U.S. companies without escalating a trade war too quickly.",
      "\u201cThe measures are fairly modest, at least relative to U.S. moves, and have clearly been calibrated to try to send a message to the U.S. (and domestic audiences) without inflicting too much damage,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics, wrote in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is a risk that retaliation backfires by encouraging Trump to escalate tariffs further.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump made tariffs central to his plan to revive the U.S. economy, arguing that putting significant duties on imports would encourage companies to move their manufacturing plants to the United States and protect industries from cheaper overseas competition. Trump has also proposed using revenue from tariffs to pay for other policy priorities.",
      "But economists and businesses have warned that tariffs would be likely to have little effect on driving manufacturing back to the United States because of the costs, logistics, regulatory barriers and lack of labor many industries would face in moving production stateside. A study of Trump\u2019s tariffs during his first term found they reduced overall manufacturing employment by driving up costs for companies importing parts and materials from China.",
      "Ahead of Trump\u2019s election, companies had been warning that they would be likely to raise prices in response to the tariffs if Trump carried through on his threats, including AutoZone, Columbia Sportswear and Black and Decker. None of the companies responded to requests for comment Tuesday on whether they planned to go through with those plans.",
      "\u201cIf we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer, and we\u2019ll pass them through,\u201d AutoZone CEO Philip Daniele told investors in September.",
      "Clothing",
      "Consumers are also likely to see higher prices on clothing, with about 30% of U.S. apparel coming from China. The tariffs could cause clothing prices to rise as much as 2% for some brands, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates.",
      "Personal health and beauty products could feel the impact of the tariffs, as well. Cosmetics maker e.l.f. Beauty, which makes the vast majority of its products in China, may have to increase prices by around 3% unless it is able to offset those costs by negotiating concessions from suppliers or shifting more production out of China, Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian said in a note to clients.",
      "Tech and drug prices",
      "Apple is among the technology companies most at risk from the tariffs with the vast majority of iPhones made in China.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Apple was able to mostly avoid having to pay Trump\u2019s tariffs by receiving government waivers. While Apple hasn't commented on how it will respond to the latest round of tariffs, analysts expect it to have to raise prices to compensate for the higher costs.",
      "The tariffs could also drive up drug prices. About half of generic drugs taken in the United States are made entirely overseas, and China is\u00a0increasingly playing a role in making those ingredients, according to data from United States Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit group that focuses on the safety of the drug supply chain."

      "Much of the scientific communication typically released publicly from federal health agencies remains on pause, according to multiple sources within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health.",

      "The halt in communications is occurring during an intense flu season and outbreaks of other respiratory illnesses, as well as an escalating bird flu outbreak.",
      "\u201cTheir effects on the CDC has led to a near complete stop of day-to-day work,\u201d said a physician at the CDC who was not authorized to speak publicly.",

      "The pause was expected to end Feb. 1.",
      "Andrew Nixon, HHS\u2019 director of communications, wrote in an email Tuesday that \u201cseveral types of external communications\u201d are no longer subject to the\u00a0pause, and that \u201call HHS divisions have been given clear guidance on how to seek approval for any other type of mass communication.\u201d",
      "Nixon did not clarify what he meant by \u201cexternal communications.\u201d",
      "One of the CDC\u2019s weekly reports on flu activity was delayed by several days. And while the agency has updated its\u00a0bird flu website, it has not held a public briefing on the matter in weeks.",
      "The CDC hasn\u2019t published its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, or MMWR, since Jan. 16.",
      "One CDC employee confirmed that their scientific paper and multiple others that have nothing to do with DEI had been pulled from near publication at peer-reviewed journals.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s perfectly natural and appropriate for a new administration to take a different approach to policy,\u201d said Dr. Richard Besser, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting CDC director. But squashing scientific facts and data, he said, is \u201cchilling.\u201d",
      "The communications blackout began nearly two weeks ago, followed by a flurry of those memos from the HHS instructing federal agencies to stop any work involving DEI or gender ideologies and delete such messaging on their websites. Some websites have been restored, but it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ve been modified.",
      "An NIH scientist said that as of Monday, teams were told they could resume closed-door meetings, but were still forbidden from talking to media or presenting data at conferences because those findings would be released to the public. The scientist was not authorized to speak publicly."

      "Following up on a report by NBC News, Rep. Jamie Raskin, House Judiciary Committee ranking member, and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a subcommittee ranking member, asked for an accounting of immigration enforcement actions since Jan. 20 involving U.S. citizens.",
      "The request was made in a letter signed by Raskin, D-Md., and Jayapal, D-Wash., whose subcommittee oversees immigration. It was sent Tuesday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Caleb Vitello, Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting director. A copy of the letter was first provided to NBC News.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not out looking for criminals based on crimes committed, but undocumented immigrants based on their looks, you\u2019re going to sweep up a lot of innocent people, including innocent citizens,\u201d Raskin said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen cases of racial and ethnic profiling leading to the unlawful detention of U.S. citizens. That\u2019s why I\u2019m demanding answers about some of these profoundly troubling stories we\u2019ve heard about citizens being targeted, detained\u00a0and questioned.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers noted that per a 2015 ICE policy regarding investigation of U.S. citizens, \u201cICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest and/or detain a U.S. citizen.\u201d And ICE officers and agents and attorneys have to handle the interactions with the \u201cutmost care and highest priority,\u201d the letter stated.",
      "\u201cThis principle is essential to prevent the escalating government assault on immigrants from becoming a steamroller that crushes the rights of American citizens,\u201d the lawmakers' letter said.",
      "ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "The recent cases have led to complaints that some people are being racially profiled, targeted by ICE because of their race or skin color.",
      "Late last month, Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren said Navajo citizens who live off-reservation had complained of being questioned about their identity by ICE officers. Nygren spoke about the complaints in a radio address.",
      "A business owner in New Jersey where ICE conducted a raid said one of his employees who is a veteran and from Puerto Rico was made to show officers his identification. NBC News attempts to reach the veteran were unsuccessful. Employees who answered phone calls to the owner's business Tuesday said he's declining media interviews.",
      "Although it was not mentioned in the letter, the Mescalero Apache Tribe in New Mexico announced one of its members was approached by an ICE agent who spoke in Spanish. The Mescalero Apache member speaks English and told the ICE agent that. The ICE agent then asked for his passport, the tribe said in its announcement.",
      "ICE did not respond to questions from NBC News last week about detaining the Navajo citizens and the veteran.",
      "The lawmakers\u2019 letter also cited a January Telemundo Puerto Rico report that a toddler, his mother and grandmother in Milwaukee were detained and sent to a detention center. ICE has since said the report was false.",
      "The letter asks ICE and DHS to provide by 5 p.m. on Feb. 18 the total number of U.S. citizens detained; the name and age of detained U.S. citizens; where and for how long they were detained; whether any had a criminal record and what the crimes were, if any; and the name of each agency involved in the enforcement action.",
      "The lawmakers also ask whether ICE\u2019s policy regarding encounters with U.S. citizens is still in effect, and if not, what policies or procedures it has in place. They also ask if there have been any updates to policies and procedures since last month\u2019s incidents.",
      "Concerns over ICE confrontations with U.S. citizens have led to congressional inquiries in previous administrations. A report issued by the Government Accountability Office during the Biden administration found that from Oct. 1, 2015, to March 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential U.S. citizens, detained 121 and removed 70. The report noted that ICE at the time had conflicting policies on questioning U.S. citizens and did not track its encounters with U.S. citizens well."

      "Taylor Hanson: This album is special for a bunch of reasons. One, it launched us into an independent period. We launched a label, (so) it was a time where it was about taking chances and investing in our fans. ... It\u2019s really (a) \u201cthank you\u201d to a lot of fans that have stuck with us. Here we are, 20 years later, many albums later, many laps around the world later, and we really feel like we owe that to them, and so we wanted to do something special to celebrate.",
      "Zac Hanson: \u201cUnderneath\u201d was an album that had about 80 songs written for it. It seemed like a special way to remember that that record was to include some of the songs that did make it to a full recording, and include in that story the people that were involved \u2014 like Carole King, who we wrote songs with, and Bob Marlette, who produced, and Greg Wells. ... So by adding more music to it and getting to revisit some of the songs, it sort of completes the story of that record and all that were involved.",
      "What does \u201cPenny & Me\u201d mean to you now?",
      "Isaac Hanson: \u201cPenny & Me\u201d was a really important part of the story of \u201cUnderneath.\u201d It\u2019s the very first single that we released from that record, but it was one of the very last songs that we recorded for the record. ... We knew this song would find a special place, and it certainly has found a special place \u2014 not only for us personally, but with the fan base.",
      "Zac: \u201cPenny & Me\u201d is also a song that really has a lot of references to other people\u2019s music that inspired us, (it\u2019s) sort of a love letter to that. ... The new version of \u201cPenny & Me\u201d \u2014 we call it the \u201cMoonlight\u201d version \u2014 takes that another step further, in not just referencing songs like \u201cFeelin\u2019 Alright?\u201d or \u201cPink Moon\u201d by Nick Drake, but actually saying, what if we leaned into that style and did it in a different way?",
      "Taylor: \u201cPenny & Me\u201d has brought people together in many ways. ... We said let\u2019s do a new music video that brings things back. We had Samaire\u00a0Armstrong reprise her role as Penny in the video. I have a daughter named Penny, who played the 20-years-later Penny. Then Natalie Morales, who was a Hanson fan who became a successful director and writer \u2014 (she) became the director this. So you have all these things converging.",
      "What is the meaning of \u201cMMMBop\u201d?",
      "Zac: \u201cMMMBop\u201d is a song really about (how) we all have to make choices in life \u2014 some relationships will last and some will be short-lived. Even as a young person, we saw that you had to choose the path you wanted to be on and fight for the relationships and people you want to be in your life. ... The chorus is really about the passage of time (and) how things will come and go, and the verses talk about how you\u2019re going to have to grab and reach for the stuff that you want to be a part of your life.",
      "Taylor: We\u2019ve always loved the idea of putting a little bit of optimism into, well, there\u2019s a problem, a challenge, but this is where we\u2019re trying to go \u2014\u00a0and really, that\u2019s what \u201cMMMBop\u201d is. It\u2019s saying all these things are challenging, but you can\u2019t change it. You have to embrace the moment. You have to be here right now.",
      "What advice would you give to young new artists?",
      "Zac: The first thing that we did was listen to other artists we loved and learn to sing their songs. That\u2019s important. In a way, the apprenticeship of every musician is to first mimic. But the most important thing will be what you do that no one else does. The way you present your personality and your story and put your own words into your songs and your ideas. It\u2019s your voice that\u2019s going to be the thing that lasts generations if you have that moment to connect with people.",
      "Isaac: Writing songs is a really, really important element of your creativity, because at the end of the day, you\u2019re the one standing out there singing them. So you better have your signature on it in some way, shape or form. And the best way is to learn to be a good writer.",
      "What is your kids' relationship to music like?",
      "Zac: Taylor\u2019s seven kids, my five, Isaac\u2019s three \u2014 it\u2019s a brood.",
      "Taylor: There\u2019s absolutely a few musicians. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be a cousin band ... but I think there\u2019s natural collaboration. There is some music being made between the cousins, because they\u2019re around each other and around music. ... It\u2019ll be something that we can\u2019t predict \u2014 who decides to embrace it and make this their life \u2014 but I would guess we\u2019ll have a few. Between the 15, the odds are with us.",
      "What are some of your next goals as a band?",
      "Taylor: We\u2019ve gotten to do some really amazing musical things. A couple years ago, we worked with symphonies all over the world. ... Honestly, (it\u2019s) writing, producing and taking your passion and getting behind other creators too \u2014 being that person to do what others did for us when we started. ... So I think you\u2019ll see us champion other artists, supporting and helping make those things happen.",
      "Dream band collaboration?",
      "Isaac: We are always into the idea of collaboration. ... We\u2019ve kind of joked about back and forth with the girls in Haim. Haim-son!",
      "Zac: Brothers and sisters together.",
      "Isaac: The cool thing is, you (Zac) are a drummer \u2014 they don\u2019t have a drummer in their band.",
      "Zac: We don\u2019t have a bass player.",
      "Isaac: Este\u2019s a bass player, so, you know, we finally have a complete band.",
      "What was your hair-care routine for your iconic looks?",
      "Isaac: I wish that we had an ability to say something to people about (our) hair anything other than I use random shampoos.",
      "Zac: I only wash my hair about once every six weeks. ... The answer is that, I think, just stop putting chemicals in and let your body just do the work.",
      "Isaac: You only wash your hair every six weeks? I wash my hair like the every three days.",
      "Zac: Every six weeks, probably, I put shampoo in my hair. Just putting it out there: Rinse it all the time, but don't put soap in it.",
      "Taylor: The Hanson hair-care line is really a long time coming, we should just go ahead with that and it\u2019s going to basically involve not doing much.",
      "Zac: The hair care line would be like an empty bottle."

      "During an appearance on The Jamie Kern Lima Show podcast, published Feb. 4, Holker said Boss first visited her days after he died.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always had dreams since I was young that sometimes come to life and I\u2019ve had dreams that become very real,\u201d Holker began, explaining that she had \u201cseen my children in my dreams before they were born.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter Stephen had passed, I hadn\u2019t slept in about four or five days I think had gone by at this point, and my kids really hadn\u2019t either,\u201d she said. \u201cZaia was crying hysterically, and it was supposed to be naptime but she just could not settle herself. She could not go to sleep.\u201d",
      "Holker said that she went into daughter Zaia\u2019s room, adding that her daughter was \u201cvery, very little\u201d and \u201cstill trying to comprehend what had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI closed my eyes, but I wasn\u2019t asleep yet, and everything started shaking in the room,\u201d Holker said. \u201cThere was almost, like, the static you see on the TV behind my eyes, the black and white static, and I saw three faces. And I don\u2019t know to this day what those other two faces were. But it was staticky in between three different faces.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cAt the very end, I held on to one of the faces and it said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry, and I love you so much. I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 And Stephen\u2019s face faded away.\u201d",
      "After seeing Boss\u2019 apparition, Holker said the two were finally able to take a nap, \u201cthe first time I slept ... since everything had happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cI woke up and I felt a lot more settled. I wasn\u2019t fully healed or anything like that, but I felt settled that he was watching over us and looking out for us,\u201d Holker said.",
      "Holker told host Jamie Kern Lima that Boss has continued to appear to her and their oldest daughter, Wesley.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times when it\u2019s been really beautiful and there\u2019s been times when it\u2019s been a little scary,\u201d she said, adding that she has has to ask Boss at times to \u201cgive some space.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know that he\u2019s watching over our family,\u201d she continued. \u201cI know that Stephen always loved us and always wanted to protect us. And in whatever way in his mind, he thought he was doing that.\u201d",
      "Though Holker said she has forgiven Boss for herself, she added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever forgive him for my kids.\u201d",
      "Holker just released a memoir, \u201cThis Far: My Story of Love, Loss, and Embracing the Light\u201d on Feb. 4, 2025, which she has said includes information from Boss\u2019 journals.",
      "Addressing backlash from Boss' family she received after an interview where she spoke about the book, Holker subsequently shared a lengthy statement to her Instagram story.",
      "\u201cTo fans of Stephen and our family and friends, I want to be clear that my only intention in writing the book is to share my own story as well as part of my life with Stephen to help other people,\u201d she said. \u201cJust like you, I never really knew what happened, and even as I am trying to put the pieces together I will never really know.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn sharing I hope that maybe they can catch some (of) the red flags that I missed before it\u2019s too late,\u201d she continued."

      "Have the waves turned in 2025 or are the Chiefs still the favored team? We consulted four astrologers and four tarot readers to get their predictions about who would win the Super Bowl in 2025. The predictions are mixed \u2013 but one team is a clear winner.",

      "The results were somewhat mixed, with two tarot readers convinced of the Eagles' victory, one believing the Chiefs will win and another saying the Chiefs will face will face \"strong competition\" and obstacles in their quest to win their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Blue June predicts the Eagles will win in a well-matched challenge. says. \"I pulled the Nine of Wands for the Eagles victory which means from start to finish the Chiefs put up a great fight and the game is especially intense during the first quarter as I\u2019ve pulled the Emperor card. The Nine of Pentacles warns the Eagles to move with caution and discipline, but they will surely persevere,\u201d she says.",
      "Theresa Reed, aka the Tarot Lady, forecasts the Chiefs will win. For the overall game, she pulled the Page of Swords, which she says means \"the game will be down to the wire,\" and \"a last-minute surprise move changes the game in an exciting way.\" She predicts one person will have an \"incredibly strong night.\"",
      "Sarah Potter predicted the Eagles would win after pulling the Seven of Wands, which she said symbolizes standing your ground and facing challenges. \"This could indicate that the Chiefs might need to defend their title and face strong competition,\" she says. Next, she pulled the Eight of Wands reversed. \"This card suggests delays or obstacles which implies that there are issues or setbacks that the team may need to overcome before achieving a win,\u201d she says.",
      "Fernando Salinas said things aren't looking good for the Chiefs. \"I pulled the Nine of Swords \u2014 definitely not a good omen. This is the card of anxiety, of worry, and of doubt,\" he says. Meanwhile, he pulled The Chariot for the Philadelphia Eagles. \"The Chariot is the card of victory, success, and ambition, and so a much better sign that the winning plays might be made by the Eagles this year,\" he says.",

      "Catherine Urban calls this a \"very difficult call\" but concludes that the underdog Eagles will \"surprise fans with a better performance.\" She points to the moon in Cancer conjunct, or next to, Mars, currently retrograde in Cancer. Two of the quarterbacks \u2014 Hurts and Carson Wentz, alternate QB of the Chiefs \u2014\u00a0have Mars in Cancer, meaning this transit will affect them and be a significant moment.",
      "Lauren Ash predicts a \"nail-biter\" going back and forth until the end, ultimately resulting in a Chiefs victory. \"Energy drainer for all players \u2014 a total slog. Emotions will dominate the game. You will not have an idea of who is going to win this game until the end,\u201d Ash says.",
      "Renee Watt says the Eagles will benefit most from current planetary placements: \u201cWith the Cancer moon crossing over the team\u2019s natal Pluto, a surge of empowerment and emotional investment can give them the edge they need to score a win. With the sun and Mercury close to their North Node, an ability to think ahead will make it easier to anticipate the moves of their opponents. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the Chiefs won\u2019t put up a fight!\u201d",
      "Meghan Rose said Jupiter makes the case for either team winning.  Ultimately she thinks the Eagles will be the major upset winners.",
      "In total, that amounts to five predictions for an Eagles victory and two for a Chiefs. We'll have to watch the game on Feb. 9 to find out."

      "Through her 90-minute Broadway debut, the internet icon not only invented Broadway and Diet Coke, she also traveled back in time to the 1860s and finally understood gravity.",
      "If you're like, \"Huh? What? Oh, haha, OK,\" so was the audience in the St. James Theatre on Feb. 3, where Paytas leaned into her niche for some 1,700 of her fans, plus thousands tuning in on a worldwide livestream to watch her achieve her lifelong dream of starring on Broadway.",
      "\"It's the perfect blend of everything \u2014 it's a little bit Trish, and it's a lot of bit Broadway,\" Paytas told TODAY.com an interview ahead of her performance. \"So I've been just taking it all in because it's even more than I imagined. I saw the finale, and I was just like crying because I didn't think this was, like, possible.\"",
      "Paytas pulled out references to her now viral YouTube videos, while also bringing out Broadway legends like Sutton Foster, Ben Platt and Rachel Zegler as guests in exaggerated, onstage interviews for a makeshift version of her podcast (while also singing some duets, of course.)",
      "The 36-year-old internet personality has been filming her life for the better part of two decades, amassing more than 5.1 million subscribers on YouTube, where she's known for her vlogs, mukbangs and of course, music covers (which have spanned Broadway hits like \"Beetlejuice,\" \"Wicked\" and many others).",
      "The absurd, one-night-only special gave fans around the world a glimpse into the mind of Paytas \u2014 complete with throwbacks to her meme-worthy moments (like crying on her kitchen floor), while also incorporating nods to her podcast with Broadway stars.",
      "In the sold-out special, Paytas proved she's made a name for herself beyond the internet, starring on Broadway just months after she made a cameo on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Paytas gave TODAY.com a behind-the-scenes look as she was rehearsing for the show to make her Broadway dreams come true.",
      "\"That's why I'm losing my voice today,\" Paytas said after her second day of rehearsals. \"Because I was just like, going crazy.\"",
      "It all started as a joke. Seriously.",
      "The idea of Paytas starring on Broadway started less than a year ago \u2014 as an April Fools' Day joke.",
      "Kobi Kassal, producer of \"Trisha Paytas' Big Broadway Dream\" and editor-in-chief at Theatrely.com, told TODAY.com ahead of the premiere he always runs a couple of silly articles on his website for April Fools' Day. So in 2024, he published an article that said Paytas would be making her Broadway debut as Roxie in \"Chicago\" over the summer.",
      "\"It was just believable enough where I thought people would get a kick out of it, but we made it very, very clear that it was not true,\" Kassal said. \"It was all in fun, because we love her so much.\"",
      "Kassal posted the article and sent it out on social media before heading to a preview performance of \"Cabaret\" on Broadway. During intermission, Kassal said he turned on his phone and began receiving hundreds of notifications.",
      "\"Trisha had posted that article to every social media platform, like Instagram stories, on the actual grid, on her Twitter, it was everywhere,\" Kassal recalled. \"She had posted it and she was kind of playing along with it and egging it on. She was like, 'Can't wait.'\"",
      "After reading comments that people had bought tickets for dates they thought Paytas would be in \"Chicago,\" Kassal said he worried he had taken it too far.",
      "\"But why can't Trisha be on Broadway? Why can't this be a thing?\" he remembered asking along with another Broadway producer, George Strus.",
      "The pair put their heads together and approached Paytas' team. \"Since April, we've been slowly working with her and her team, and now today, we're at our first rehearsal of her own Broadway musical,\" Kassal said.",
      "Paytas said the article, though it was originally a joke, is \"the ultimate power of manifestation.\"",
      "\"I Google myself from time to time, and I saw the article, and for a minute, I thought it was real. I was like, 'Wow, maybe I missed an email, maybe it's real,'\" she said. \"So I posted it because, you know, I always think \u2014 well, maybe the people on 'Chicago' will see the hype.\"",
      "\"I think the majority were like, 'Oh my God, this is amazing,' not realizing it was an April Fools' article, but it did manifest this show, which is kind of even better to have your own,\" she said.",
      "Rehearsals, celeb guests, a livestream \u2014 oh my!",
      "Paytas flew in on a red eye a week before the show. She arrived in New York City on Tuesday morning and immediately headed to rehearsals for the next six days.",

      "The show, which proclaims it's completely original and never-been-done-before, borrowed elements from \"A Christmas Carol\" and followed Paytas as she has a nightmare about never performing on Broadway.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re really diving into the mind of Trisha Paytas and discovering her love of Broadway and figuring out what it means to create a Broadway show and be a Broadway star,\u201d Kassal said of the show.",
      "The \"ghosts\" of Broadway past, present and future (Foster, Platt and Zegler, respectively) arrived to help Paytas on her journey to find herself by starring on a makeshift podcast set (a reference to Paytas' \"Just Trish\" podcast) and sitting for an interview before singing Broadway hits.",
      "Joy Woods played the role of \"Broadway\" in the show, serving as the show's narrator and appearing in person toward the end of the special.",
      "Paytas said she didn't think having names like Woods, Foster, Platt or Zegler would be possible for her show.",
      "\"It's very surreal,\" she said. \"I think I was psyching myself out as a little intimidated \u2014 but after going through the vocal practices, everyone's so nice. Sutton Foster's the nicest person. All that stuff makes me feel so much better, because it's intimidating, you know? I'm excited, and I'm honored to have them be a part of it.\""

      "The amended complaint includes text messages between Lively and Baldoni, as well as between Reynolds and Baldoni. It also alleges that the New York Times may have been working on its article about Lively\u2019s complaint for \u201cmonths before\u201d the complaint was filed.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorney Bryan Freedman said in a statement that the amended lawsuit \u201cwas a logical next step due to the overwhelming amount of new proof that has come to light.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis fresh evidence corroborates what we knew all along, that due to a blind pursuit of power, Ms. Lively and her entire team colluded for months to destroy reputations through a complex web of lies, false accusations and the manipulation of illicitly received communications,\u201d Freedman said in the statement.",
      "A New York Times spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cThe Baldoni/Wayfarer legal filings are rife with inaccuracies about The New York Times, including, for example, the bogus claim that The Times had early access to Ms. Lively\u2019s state civil rights complaint.",
      "\u201cMr. Baldoni\u2019s lawyers base their erroneous claim on postings by amateur internet sleuths, who, not surprisingly, are wrong,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe sleuths have noted that a version of the Lively state complaint published by The Times carries the date \u2018December 10\u2019 even though the\u00a0complaint wasn\u2019t filed until more than a week later. The problem: that date is generated by Google software and is unrelated to the date when The Times received it and posted it.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Lively, Reynolds and Sloane for comment on the amended complaint.",
      "The website launch comes weeks after Freedman released behind-the-scenes footage that he argues doesn't corroborate Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set. In her December legal complaint, Lively alleged that Baldoni improvised scenes of physical intimacy and crossed boundaries.",
      "Her lawyers responded to the footage release in a statement to NBC News, claiming, \u201cThe video shows Mr. Baldoni repeatedly leaning in toward Ms. Lively, attempting to kiss her, kissing her forehead, rubbing his face and mouth against her neck, flicking her lip with his thumb, caressing her, telling her how good she smells, and talking with her out of character,\u201d Lively\u2019s legal team said. \u201cEvery moment of this was improvised by Mr. Baldoni with no discussion or consent in advance, and no intimacy coordinator present.\u00a0Mr. Baldoni was not only Ms. Lively\u2019s co-star, but the director, the head of studio and Ms. Lively\u2019s boss.\u201d",
      "Freedman previously said in a January interview on TODAY that his team planned  \u201cto release every single text message between the two of them,\u201d referring to Baldoni and Lively.",
      "\u201cThere is nothing that in any way is a concern about this entire situation from our perspective, and we want the truth to be out there,\u201d Freedman said at the time.",
      "A U.S. district court judge said Jan. 27 that Baldoni and Lively's lawsuits will be joined and both cases will go to trial March 9, 2026, according to documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "A pretrial conference is scheduled for Feb. 3."

While I\u2019d always assumed I\u2019d be a working mom, Bill\u2019s schedule as CEO was all-consuming, and I knew I wanted my kids to have the kind of family life I\u2019d had growing up \u2014 full of books and science experiments and after-school glasses of iced tea with my mom. Not every woman has the option to say home with her kids, and I felt very lucky that I did. At the time, and under the circumstances, it seemed like a no-brainer.\u201d",

That decision is personal for each woman, but for me, it came down to this: If I wanted my daughters and son to truly believe that women can do anything, I needed to model that for them.\u201d",

      "The lifestyle mogul appears in Uber Eats' 2025 Super Bowl ad alongside Matthew McConaughey, shared on the food delivery platform's YouTube channel on Jan. 30. The commercial served up a comedic nod to one of Stewart's most awkward on-air moments.",
      "The spot recreates an infamous exchange from a 2002 appearance on CBS News' \u201cThe Early Show.\u201d",
      "At the time, Stewart was under scrutiny for an insider trading scandal, and she was appearing in a cooking segment with the show's co-host, Jane Clayson, who pressed her on the controversy. Stewart grew visibly frustrated, ultimately shutting down the conversation with the now-iconic line, \u201cI just want to focus on my salad.\"",
      "Over two decades later, she now repeats that same phrase in a new Super Bowl spot ahead of the big game on Feb. 9.",
      "\u201cSo tell me about your salad, Martha,\u201d McConaughey says in the clip as Stewart calmly prepares a Caesar salad.",
      "\u201cWell, it\u2019s a Caesar salad,\" she replies as she chops lettuce.",
      "\"In a bowl!\" McConaughey explains, to which Stewart answers, \"Obviously.\"",
      "\u201cI know what you\u2019re up to. This is a super bowl,\u201d he says.",
      "At this point, Stewart stops to ask the actor what he's getting at.",
      "\u201cWell, a super bowl is at Caesars to help you sell your Caesars during the Super Bowl, is it not?\" McConaughey counters, referring to where the upcoming Super Bowl is taking place, at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans.",
      "Martha then does a bought of manic chopping before she steadily insists, \u201cI just want to focus on my salad.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh I\u2019m focused, Martha, I\u2019m locked in,\u201d he replies before stealing a glimpse and a wink at the camera.",
      "Martha's 2024 Netflix documentary titled \"Martha\" looks back on her intense reaction and more, as it sifts through her rise, fall \u2014 which included jail time \u2014 and rebrand. Not long after the documentary\u2019s debut on the streaming service, Stewart criticized director R.J. Cutler\u2019s focus.",
      "\u201cThose last scenes with me looking like a lonely old lady walking hunched over in the garden? Boy, I told him to get rid of those. And he refused. I\u00a0hate those last scenes. Hate them,\u201d she told the New York Times in October 2024."

      "\u201cthis is all from the star of a movie that is campaigning on its progressive values, you really gotta laugh,\u201d Hagi wrote on X. \u201cstuff like this doesn\u2019t get flagged because you can say whatever you want about muslims, it\u2019s never considered racist.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 China retaliated immediately Tuesday as a 10% U.S. tariff on all Chinese goods went into effect, announcing a series of measures including its own levies of 10% to 15% on some U.S. products.",
      "Starting Feb. 10, China will impose an additional tariff of 15% on coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement automobiles and pickup trucks, the government said.",
      "The Chinese announcement came minutes after the U.S. tariff took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET, the only one to go ahead after President Donald Trump paused 25% tariffs he had announced on goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "The failure to forestall tit-for-tat tariffs with China raises the risk of a spiraling trade war between the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "\u201cThis unilateral tariff hike by the U.S. side seriously violates World Trade Organization rules, does nothing to solve its own problems, and undermines normal China\u2013U.S. economic and trade cooperation,\u201d the Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council, China\u2019s Cabinet, said in a statement.",
      "In addition, Beijing announced an investigation into Google for alleged anti-trust violations, and export controls on items related to tungsten and other rare earth elements that are critical components of high-tech products.",
      "It also said U.S. gene sequencing company Illumina and PVH Corp., the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, would be added to the \u201cunreliable entity list,\u201d restricting their ability to operate in China.",
      "Mainland Chinese markets remain closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Other Asia-Pacific markets were mostly still up on news that the Canadian and Mexican tariffs had been put on hold, CNBC reported, though stocks in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong pared gains.",
      "Beijing said it had referred the U.S. tariff measures to the World Trade Organization \u201cto safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "The additional U.S. tariff \u201cseriously violates WTO rules and is an egregious act, representing typical unilateralism and trade protectionism,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said.",
      "The U.S. has blocked the appointments of appellate judges to the World Trade Organization since Trump\u2019s first term, leaving it largely unable to mediate international trade disputes. But China could still use a lawsuit to gather international support against the U.S. tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. approach severely undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system, damages the foundation of Sino-U.S. economic and trade cooperation, and disrupts the stability of global industrial and supply chains,\u201d the Chinese Commerce Ministry said.",
      "Many Chinese products are already subject to tariffs that were introduced by Trump in his first term and were maintained or in some cases expanded by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "Beijing\u2019s newly announced tariffs are more targeted than the U.S. tariff, which appears to apply to all Chinese products, and some may have more impact than others. China doesn\u2019t import much crude oil from the U.S., for example, while Google is blocked in China and has limited business in the country after withdrawing in 2010 over a censorship dispute.",
      "Others could present more of a challenge. The U.S. imports about a quarter of its tungsten from China, which produces about 80% of the world\u2019s supply, meaning there are few alternative sources. The critical metal is used by chipmakers such as Nvidia.",
      "China\u2019s tariffs are \u201clargely symbolic\u201d and will have limited impact on the U.S., said Tianchen Xu, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, adding that they cover only\u00a08.5% of all Chinese imports from the U.S. last year.",
      "They also represent a change in approach from Trump\u2019s first term, when China responded to tariffs more strongly. That is more difficult now as China struggles with an economic slowdown.",
      "\u201cTrump wants a lot from the\u00a0Chinese side, and he\u00a0will\u00a0launch one attack after another,\u201d Xu said in an email. \u201cChina has no intent to escalate the conflict, given that any escalation will exert further pressure onto its economy.\u201d",
      "Trump announced the 10% China tariff Saturday along with 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, citing border security, as well as the illicit international flow of drugs such as fentanyl. Though the Canadian and Mexican tariffs have been paused for 30 days after talks with those countries\u2019 leaders, no such deal appears to have been struck with China.",
      "Trump is expected to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping \u201cin the next couple of days,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday.",
      "China appears to be taking a different approach than Canada, Mexico and Colombia, all of which made concessions to the U.S. to avoid the immediate imposition of tariffs.",
      "\u201cI would\u2019ve waited to try to negotiate with Trump, because Trump might have avoided the tariffs for good if China had shown some compromise,\u201d said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at\u00a0Natixis in Hong Kong.",
      "Trump said the 10% tariff on China was meant to pressure Beijing to stem the flow of precursor chemicals from China to Mexico and other countries, where they are processed into fentanyl and then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "Though the U.S. and China say Beijing has taken some action,  China says that the best way for the U.S. to solve its deadly fentanyl crisis is to reduce domestic demand and that tariffs could affect future cooperation on drug control.",
      "\u201cFentanyl is an issue for the U.S.,\u201d the Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIn the spirit of humanity and goodwill, China has given support to the U.S.\u2019s response to this issue.\u201d",
      "Trump said Monday that the 10% tariff was just \u201can opening salvo.\u201d",

From October 2023 to May, the United States, hospitals, various nongovernmental organizations and local officials in Gaza were able to quietly move just 150 patients, most of them children, out of Gaza for lifesaving care.",
      "After the Rafah crossing shut down when Israeli forces captured it in May, the improbable became nearly impossible.",
      "The last significant evacuation appeared to have been in June, when 21 critically ill children were evacuated from the Gaza Strip."

      "Four years after a military coup that has morphed into a grinding civil war, experts say there is a growing mental health crisis in the Southeast Asian nation, made worse by the junta\u2019s atrocities against civilians and a humanitarian disaster that has left more than 3 million people displaced.",
      "They find some relief at the Mae Tao Clinic on the outskirts of Mae Sot, a border town in neighboring Thailand.",
      "Each morning, hundreds of Burmese arrive at the clinic, waiting to see a doctor, receive vaccinations or get a prenatal checkup. Some are living in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, while others have jobs as migrant workers or have crossed into Thailand illegally.",
      "The donor-funded clinic, which opened in the 1980s with only four beds, has since evolved into a full-fledged primary health facility that offers a range of free services, including psychiatric care. It says its 700 doctors, nurses, medics and volunteers treat 120,000 people a year, a number that may increase after a freeze on foreign aid by the Trump administration that threatens to close U.S.-supported health care facilities treating Myanmar refugees in Thai border camps.",
      "Those who have fled Myanmar \u201chave so many traumas,\u201d said Thein, a Myanmar refugee who is one of the psychiatric care unit\u2019s two Burmese-speaking psychiatrists.",
      "On Tuesdays and Fridays, the two days the unit is open, Thein walks past the bustling outpatient wards and crosses a tranquil bamboo garden to his office. It is a single-story cement building painted light blue, with the windows and doors covered in translucent black film to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Thein, 36, sees about 10 patients a day in one-on-one sessions. They include rebel soldiers injured on the front lines as well as political refugees and migrant workers.",
      "\u201cThey have flashbacks and nightmares at night and they cannot sleep,\u201d said Thein, who has been in Mae Sot for a year and asked not to be identified by his full name to protect his safety and that of his family.",
      "While the clinic has social workers and counselors for patients with milder mental health issues, Thein works with the most serious cases.",
      "\u201cI can give counseling to them, like mindfulness or meditation or breathing,\u201d he said. But often his patients also require medication, which the clinic provides for free.",
      "Thein said he sometimes struggles with anxiety himself stemming from the abuse he received from the junta.",
      "Like most of his patients, Thein\u2019s life took a turn on Feb. 1, 2021, when the Myanmar military \u2014 which has ruled the former British colony for much of its history since it gained independence in 1948 \u2014 overthrew democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Peaceful protests broke out immediately, to which the new military government responded with deadly violence.",
      "According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit group that has documented killings and arrests since the coup, the junta has killed at least 6,000 people and arrested more than 28,000. On Friday, Myanmar state media reported that the state of emergency that has been in place since the coup had been extended for another six months, further delaying promised elections.",
      "Though the junta remains in charge, its hold on power has slipped in the face of a coordinated offensive by ethnic rebel groups that have fought the Myanmar military for decades. In the past year the government has lost control of vast swaths of territory around the country, creating instability along Myanmar\u2019s borders with Thailand, India, China and others.",
      "\u201cI want to help my friends, but I don\u2019t want to kill people,\u201d Thein said. \u201cSo I treated the wounded people or wounded soldiers.\u201d",
      "Thein was arrested in 2022 on suspicion of helping the resistance and sent to Myanmar\u2019s notorious Insein Prison.",
      "\u201cThey tortured me with a whip. I think six people beat me during the interrogation. It was really scary,\u201d Thein recalled, as he raised his hands around his head to demonstrate how he tried to protect himself.",
      "Thein was released after a year of detention. Fearing another arrest, he left his life in Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s largest city, and fled to Thailand.",
      "Mae Sot has long been a place for Burmese to seek sanctuary, but it is an uneasy refuge. It is filled with people waiting for resettlement, living with constant anguish while facing the risk of arrest and deportation.",
      "Every month, Burmese who lack the documents needed to stay in Thailand legally have to pay local police 300 baht ($9) to obtain a card that prevents them from being detained or deported, but many find this fee unaffordable.",
      "\u201cSome patients were arrested on the way to the clinic by the Thai police because they have no documents,\u201d Thein said.",
      "The clinic\u2019s founder, Cynthia Maung, was also a doctor in Myanmar before she fled in 1988 amid a crackdown by the military government on a pro-democracy uprising.",
      "\u201cI think the struggles now and back then are very similar,\u201d she said.",
      "Mental health is often neglected in Myanmar, where Thein was trained. According to the World Health Organization, as of 2019 there were only 117 psychiatrists and two mental health hospitals in the country of 54 million people.",
      "Shwe Zin Aung is one of Thein\u2019s patients and has been struggling with bipolar disorder for a decade.",
      "The 35-year-old teacher arrived in Mae Sot from Myanmar\u2019s capital city, Naypyidaw, in early December, following in her brother\u2019s footsteps. She said that in addition to free medication, the clinic provided her with a safe place to talk about her feelings.",
      "Though she said she had not personally faced any abuse from the junta, \u201cit is so frustrating to see them brutally shoot the protesters,\u201d she said.",
      "Back home, Thein and his patients had respectable careers and stable lives, but here they are stateless \u2014 as are more than half a million people in Thailand, most of them from Myanmar.",
      "Though Bangkok has not ratified the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention and does not officially recognize refugees, Thai authorities have largely tolerated the influx of people from Myanmar, even before the coup in 2021.",
      "In October, the government of Thailand said it would grant citizenship to nearly 500,000\u00a0long-term residents as well as some children born in the country in an effort to address their legal status.",
      "Though her clinic is well known in Myanmar, Maung, 65, has not been in the country for almost four decades.",
      "When she first arrived in Thailand at the age of 28, Muang assumed she would return home in a few months once the political environment stabilized. But months soon turned into years.",

      "Among those driven out of Myanmar by the coup, she said, were psychiatrists and psychologists who came to Mae Sot and have enabled the clinic to expand its services to help others struggling with displacement.",

      "Asked who would live there, Trump said, \u201cI envision the world people living there, the world\u2019s people. You\u2019ll make that into an international unbelievable place. I think the potential in the Gaza strip is unbelievable,\u201d and it could be \u201cthe riviera of the Middle East.\u201d",

      "The president did not answer questions about the legality of essentially taking over a sovereign territory.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Netanyahu said one of his goals is to make sure Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again, and that \u201cTrump sees a different future for that piece of land.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about it,\u201d Netanyahu said of Trump\u2019s Gaza Strip suggestion.\u00a0\u201cI think it\u2019s something that could change history and it worthwhile really pursuing this avenue.\u201d",
      "During Netanyahu's visit, Trump repeatedly called Gaza a \"demolition site\" and said that the Palestinians who are living there should be relocated, claiming they would be \u201cthrilled\u201d to live elsewhere and are only staying because they have \"no alternative.\"",
      "\"The whole thing is a mess,\" Trump said of Gaza, which has been devastated by the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "\"I don't think people should be going back to Gaza. I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. They've lived like hell; they've lived like you're living in hell. Gaza is not a place for people to be living. The only reason they want to go back, and I believe this strongly, is they have no alternative. What's the alternative? Go where? If they had an alternative, they'd much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful alternative that's safe,\" he said.",
      "Trump said the approximately 1.8 million Palestinians should be moved to a new site or sites in other Arab countries, such as Egypt or Jordan, where they can \"live in peace.\"",
      "\"They say they\u2019re not going to accept\" them, Trump said of Egypt and Jordan. \"I say they will, but I think other countries will accept also.\"",
      "Trump said that Palestinians going to a new land \"would be a lot better than going back to Gaza, which has had decades and decades of death.\"",
      "\"They'll be resettled in areas where they can live a beautiful life,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether that would mean forcibly displacing people, Trump said, \"I don't think so.\"",
      "A spokesman for Hamas, Sami Abu Zuhri, blasted Trump\u2019s remarks, saying, \u201cWe consider it a recipe for creating chaos and tension in the region.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur people in the Gaza Strip will not allow these plans to pass, and what is required is to end the occupation and aggression against our people, not expel them from their land,\u201d he said.",
      "The meeting with Netanyahu was Trump's first with a foreign leader since the start of his second term.",
      "Trump previewed the discussion at the White House as a \"very big meeting\" when he was speaking to reporters Sunday. In his letter inviting Netanyahu to Washington last week, he wrote, \u201cI look forward to discussing how we can bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, and efforts to counter our shared adversaries.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that they would discuss \"the critical issues that lie ahead of us \u2014 defeating Hamas, returning all our hostages and dealing with the Iranian axis in all its components, an axis that also threatens Israel\u2019s security, the Middle East and the entire world.\"",
      "Trump's transition team helped the Biden administration secure a ceasefire and hostage release agreement between Israel and Hamas. The next phase of the agreement was expected to be one of the topics discussed Tuesday.",
      "The conflict\u00a0began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a terrorist attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Israel retaliated with an air and land assault on Gaza,\u00a0killing more than 47,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been displaced.",
      "The scale of Israeli counteroffensive has led to international condemnation, but Netanyahu has defended his actions, most recently en route to Washington.",

I think that by working hard with President Trump, we can change it even more, for the better,\" he said.",
      "Before the meeting, Trump had said he wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more Palestinian refugees as part of an effort to\u00a0\u201cclean out\u201d Gaza.",
      "Speaking to reporters ahead of Tuesday's bilateral meeting, Steve Witkoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, said Trump was referring to making the area \"habitable.\" He also said the five-year timeline to rebuild Gaza in a future phase of the ceasefire deal was unrealistic and \"preposterous.\" National security adviser Mike Waltz said rebuilding would be likely to take up to 15 years.",
      "Witkoff said: \"There\u2019s 30,000 unexploded munitions in Gaza. It is the buildings that could tip over at any moment. There\u2019s no utilities there whatsoever, no, no working water, electric, gas, nothing. God knows what kind of disease might be festering there.\"",
      "Netanyahu and Trump were close allies during Trump's first term, but their relationship became strained after Netanyahu congratulated Joe Biden on winning the 2020 election while Trump was still challenging the results.",
      "Just days after the Oct. 7 attack, Trump told a crowd at a campaign rally that Netanyahu had \u201clet us down\u201d during his first administration, arguing that he had been unhelpful before\u00a0the United States killed a top Iranian general. That led to criticism from his Republican rivals, and Trump later posted on social media, \u201c#IStandWithIsrael\u201d and \u201c#IStandWithBibi,\u201d using Netanyahu's nickname.",
      "Their relationship appeared mended in July when Netanyahu visited Trump at his Florida residence after having met with Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and after a failed attempt on Trump's life.",
      "Netanyahu said Sunday that the \"fact that this will be [Trump's] first meeting with a foreign leader since his inauguration has great significance for the state of Israel\" and \"testifies to the strength of the alliance between Israel and the United States.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday how his relationship is with Netanyahu now after the ups and downs, Trump said, \"Mostly ups.\"",
      "The trip is far from Netanyahu's first trip to the White House.",
      "When he was welcomed Monday at Blair House, the historic official guest residence of the White House, its director said it was Netanyahu's 14th visit to the residence \u2014 many more than any other foreign leader has made since it was built in the 19th century."

      "\"That\u2019s an offer President Bukele made. Obviously, we\u2019ll have to study it on our end,\" Rubio said Tuesday afternoon while speaking to reporters in Costa Rica, the third stop of his first foreign trip as secretary of state. \"There are obviously legalities involved. We have a Constitution, we have all sorts of things, but it\u2019s a very generous offer.\"",
      "The administration of President Donald Trump has not yet made a decision on the offer, Rubio said.",
      "Three legal and immigration experts who spoke with NBC News  raised questions about the legality of such actions and anticipated significant legal pushback on any effort to deport incarcerated U.S. nationals to another country.",
      "\"The U.S. can't deport one of its own citizens. Deportation is for noncitizens only,\" said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School.",

      "Fordham's Gordon said, \u201cCan the U.S. deport Salvadorans convicted of crimes to El Salvador? Yes. Can El Salvador keep those people in its own prisons? Yes. But as to U.S. citizens, it\u2019s not an immigration question. It\u2019s a prison policy question.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Prisons for comment, but did not get an immediate response.",
      "In another post on X, Bukele clarified that El Salvador is \"willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.\"",
      "\"We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,\" Bukele's post reads. \"The fee would be relatively low for the U.S. but significant for us, making our entire prison system sustainable.\"",
      "The Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, as Bukele referred to it, is a Salvadoran prison built to house 40,000 people. Instances of extreme overcrowding and torture by guards have been documented at this prison by human rights organizations such as the Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.",

      "El Salvador had previously signed\u00a0an agreement in 2019, known as a \u201csafe third country\u201d deal, to receive non-Salvadorans detained in the U.S. \u2014 but it was never implemented because of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said that noncitizens and people who have been granted protections preventing the U.S. from deporting them to a country where they may face persecution or torture \"could be sent to a third country as long as that's not the country where they would face persecution or torture.\"",
      "But as the Trump administration implements policies allowing officials to bypass regular immigration law and speed up deportations of anyone with a removal order, it may become harder for noncitizens to challenge their deportations, even if they're sent to a country where they're not from, Bush-Joseph added.",
      "Gordon said she would anticipate constitutional and due process challenges if there are attempts to deport U.S. citizens."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he wants access to Ukraine\u2019s bonanza of rare earth and critical minerals in exchange for the billions of dollars in military aid Washington has been supplying to Kyiv.",
      "It\u2019s an idea previously suggested by Republican senators and Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelenskyy, who sought to appeal to Trump\u2019s dealmaker persona as a way of keeping alive Washington\u2019s support of Kyiv.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they\u2019re going to secure what we\u2019re giving them with their rare earth and other things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday. \u201cI want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it.\u201d",
      "As well as being a global breadbasket \u2014 Ukraine is a huge supplier of wheat and other agricultural commodities \u2014 the country also has a rich seam of rare earth and critical minerals.",
      "Elements such as lithium, gallium and neodymium are crucial in producing a vast range of technologies that include electric vehicle batteries, solar panels and cutting-edge military hardware. As such, the U.S. and China among others have increasingly coveted them.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments Monday came as Ukraine and its European neighbors anxiously awaited details of his plan to end the war in Ukraine that Russia launched with its full-scale invasion three years ago.",
      "Though the president has offered few details of how peace might be achieved, his overriding complaint has been that European nations have not contributed as much as the $175 billion in assistance that makes America Ukraine\u2019s biggest donor.",
      "He also reiterated his long-held desire Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to stop that ridiculous war.\u201d",
      "That impulse has prompted nervousness among Kyiv\u2019s supporters that Trump may try to force a ceasefire favorable to Russian President Vladimir Putin. With Russia making steady battlefield gains, Putin has shown no appetite for a truce without significant territorial gains and a promise Ukraine will never join NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy has said in the past that he sees the war as one between Russia and the West, not just Ukraine, and as such has implored Western countries to provide more weaponry.",
      "The Ukrainian president has also made positive comments about working with Trump \u2014 some analysts say that he has little choice \u2014 and now there appears to be some agreement on the subject of rare earth minerals.",
      "China dominates the global market for rare earth metals, securing rights to mine some 60% and produce up to 90% of the world's supply, according to the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.",
      "That's partly due its vast \"Belt and Road\" infrastructure project through which it has developed ties to resource-rich countries. But also its willingness to process these environmentally damaging materials on behalf of Western countries, which until recently have been happy to offload this burden.",
      "Ukraine is a key player, too, with upward of 5% of the world\u2019s mineral supply, according to its national Geological Association. Many of those crucial minerals are under the frigid trenches and minefields in eastern Ukraine, however, and at risk of falling into the hands of Putin.",
      "Commenting on Trump\u2019s interest in rare earth minerals, Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Tuesday that his country was open to investment by American companies, Reuters reported.",
      "On Monday his office welcomed Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cpart of the Victory Plan that President Zelensky presented to President Trump in the fall,\u201d but warned that \u201cwe must ensure the security of Ukraine and these resources so that Russia does not simply seize them physically.\u201d",
      "That so-called \u201cvictory plan,\u201d proposed by Zelenskyy in October, offered \u201cstrategic partners\u201d such as the U.S. \u201ca special agreement\u201d to access deposits of uranium, titanium, lithium, graphite that Ukraine says are worth trillions of dollars.",
      "Trump appearing to adopt this plan shows Zelenskyy\u2019s success in appealing to the president\u2019s dealmaker instinct, according to Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy knows how Trump likes to make deals, and this plan was to make Ukraine an asset, not a liability,\u201d Lutsevych said. \u201cBut we still do not know Trump\u2019s strategy. We know bits of it but he says very little, and we only know what he says.\u201d",
      "When asked about Trump's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday that it was merely \"an offer to buy aid\" rather than \"provide it on a free of charge basis.\"",
      "\"It is better, of course, not to provide it at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,\u201d Peskov added.",
      "Though many in Europe still fear that Trump may hand Putin a win, Ukrainians themselves appear to trust the American president more than their E.U. counterparts. A December poll by the New Europe Center, a Ukrainian nongovernmental organization, found more than 44% of respondents said they trusted Trump \u2014 higher than most other European countries.",
      "One of those maintaining a positive outlook is Taras Byk, 41, a consultant and civil activist in Kyiv. He told NBC News that the rare-earth proposal would be a \u201cwin-win scenario for both Ukraine and the USA.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s moves to dismantle the U.S. agency that helps to fight starvation and poverty overseas has stoked fears that America will lose its standing on the world stage as rival powers rush to fill the void.",
      "Concerns are growing in Washington that temporarily halting assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development \u201copens up a window for China and Russia,\u201d George Ingram, a former senior USAID official, told NBC News in a telephone interview Thursday.",
      "He was one of several experts to caution that the decision would lead to American influence waning in Africa, South America and Asia where it addresses a range of needs from health care to clean water, distributing aid to nongovernmental organizations, aid agencies and nonprofits.\u00a0USAID\u00a0has also provided millions of dollars in military aid to Israel and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cNobody anticipated\u201d that Trump would suspend most foreign aid \u201cand then decapitate USAID of its personnel,\u201d said Ingram, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But on his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order halting foreign aid funding for at least 90 days so his administration could review the program\u2019s compatibility with his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy.",
      "Since then, hundreds of USAID employees and contractors have been fired or furloughed and most foreign assistance has come to a  standstill; as of Monday, USAID\u2019s website no longer loads on the web, resulting in a message that its server IP address cannot be found.",
      "Earlier Monday, the world's richest person, Elon Musk, dubbed a \u201cspecial government employee\u201d by the White House, said that the plan was to shut USAID down.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ve got to basically get rid of the whole thing. It\u2019s beyond repair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re shutting it down.\u201d",
      "The billionaire appointed by Trump to run the Department of Government Efficiency, said that he had spoken in detail about USAID with the president, who \u201cagreed we should shut it down.\u201d",
      "\u201cI actually checked with him a few times [and] said, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019\u201d Trump responded, \u201cYes,\u201d Musk added.",
      "Asked Monday about whether it would take an act of Congress to abolish USAID, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so \u2026 we just want to do the right thing.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said Monday that he was now the acting director of USAID and that he had tapped Pete Marocco, director of foreign assistance at the State Department, to begin reviewing all the work done by USAID. He also warned that certain projects or programs might be suspended or eliminated.",
      "The Trump administration plan was not \u201cabout ending the programs that USAID does, per se,\u201d he said. But Marocco\u2019s review could lead to the \u201csuspension or elimination of programs, projects or activities; closing or suspending missions or post; closing, reorganizing, downsizing, or renaming establishments, organizations, bureaus, centers, or offices; reducing the size of the workforce at such entities and contracting out or privatizing functions or activities performed by federal employees,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Rubio said: \u201cThis is not about getting rid of foreign aid.\u00a0 There are things that we do through USAID that we should continue to do, that makes sense.\u00a0 And we\u2019ll have to decide is that better through the State Department, or is that better through something, a reformed USAID?\u201d",
      "But the freeze on funding was already \u201chaving a direct effect on people whose lives are already vulnerable,\u201d Peter Taylor, director of the Institute of Development Studies, said in a telephone interview Thursday. In one case a workshop on sanitation programming was immediately halted, he added.",
      "A review by the Congressional Research Service last month found that USAID provided assistance to around 130 countries with Jordan, Syria, Ethiopia and South Sudan among the top 10 recipients. But top of the list was Ukraine which has been at war with Russia for almost three years, since President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of the country.",
      "It has also provided millions of dollars in military aid to Israel, while providing humanitarian help to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during Israel\u2019s military offensive in the enclave.",
      "Despite the freeze on funding, NBC News reported last month that Rubio issued a waiver for foreign military financing for both Israel and Egypt. A waiver was also approved for \u201cemergency food assistance and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer such assistance.\u201d",
      "In Fiscal Year 2023, the U.S. dedicated more than $44.6 billion on international development worldwide, according to USAID. But that represents less than 1% of its budget for foreign assistance, a smaller overall share than some other countries.",
      "\u2018America\u2019s enemies will rejoice\u2019",
      "Founded as an independent agency in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy, USAID was designed to counter the influence of the then-Soviet Union during the Cold War and to run various foreign assistance programs, based on the idea that American security was tied to stability and economic advancements in other nations.",
      "Since then, foreign aid has been widely viewed as a cornerstone of soft power, a term popularized in the 1980s by U.S. political scientist Joseph Nye to describe the ability to influence others to deliver desired outcomes.",
      "The decision to suspend assistance without any warning will already \u201chave a significant impact,\u201d Ingram said, adding it would \u201cdo serious damage to the trust that the U.S. has built up over the years in many countries carrying out a foreign aid program that is dependable and is seen as working in the interests of those countries.\u201d",
      "Michael Schiffer, who served as the assistant administrator of the USAID Bureau for Asia from 2022 until January, was more blunt in his assessment in an opinion piece published on the online forum Just Security.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration has just put America last, while handing a gift to our biggest adversaries, notably China,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAmerica\u2019s alliances will suffer. U.S. partners will be at risk. And America\u2019s enemies will rejoice,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. national security could \u201cerode,\u201d with abrupt changes to development programs risking instability in countries around the world, potentially influencing extremism and deepening migration crises, he added.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s allies have offered similar warnings.",
      "During the Senate Budget Committee confirmation hearing for\u00a0 Russell Vought, Trump\u2019s pick for budget chief, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. warned last month of the importance of soft power as a \u201ccritical component of defending America and our values.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t get involved in the world and you don\u2019t have programs in Africa where China\u2019s trying to buy the whole continent, we\u2019re making a mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThe concept of soft power means a lot to me \u2014 and that\u2019s coming from a pretty hawkish guy.\u201d"

      "On Saturday, Trump announced that he would slap broad 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, both U.S. allies, and 10% tariffs on China, a political foe. The move was expected, but it still sparked fears about the rising costs of goods across the U.S. economy.",
      "That concern is particularly potent because Trump campaigned heavily on lowering costs and easing inflation. If they are fully implemented, Trump's tariff proposals would affect American households' purchasing power by $1,000 to $1,200 annually, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.",

      "It was an effort to placate the Trump administration, which at times has been inconsistent with its messaging about the rationale for tariffs but has consistently said curbing the flow of drug trafficking into the United States is a main focus.",
      "Trump officials quickly took a victory lap after the announcement, even as several steps to avoid a potential heated trade war remain.",
      "\u201cSo for literally three days, I heard the far left in this country say that these tariffs would make Americans' life worse,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said at an event in Ohio in response to a question from NBC News. \u201cAnd what actually happened is the Mexican government was so afraid of the tariffs that they actually are taking their border enforcement and their anti-cartel activity more seriously.",
      "\u201cThat is not a pathway to making Americans worse off,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s a pathway to making Americans better off.\u201d",
      "Trump posted on Truth Social that he had a \u201cvery friendly conversation\u201d with Sheinbaum, a quick shift in tone. Over the weekend, she rejected what she called \u201cslander\u201d from Trump for suggesting her government had an alliance with drug traffickers.",
      "The past few days have shown one thing: Trump's tariff threats were not necessarily hollow campaign rhetoric.",
      "\u201cOne thing that is different is that leaders need to realize that Trump is serious,\u201d Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni said. \u201cIf they just think it\u2019s all bluster or campaign promises, nothing will really change, right? They have to know he is serious.\u201d",
      "Antoni predicted continued \u201cde-escalation\u201d as Trump\u2019s threats start to be interpreted as real, because of the size of the U.S. economy and the disproportionate trade relationships with Canada and Mexico. The two allies are America's largest trading partners, but international trade accounts for a much larger percentage of their overall economies.",
      "\u201cHe economically holds all the cards\u201d he said. \u201cHe has now made clear this is serious and happening. You can either get on the train, get off the tracks or get run over.\u201d",
      "At times, inconsistent rhetoric has come from the Trump administration about the motivation for tariffs. Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro told reporters in Washington on Monday that the fight is not a trade war but \"a drug war,\" echoing comments of other advisers.",
      "Trump himself, though, has repeatedly said he is concerned that the targets of the tariffs bully the United States and that the tariffs can be a weapon to end that perceived mistreatment.",
      "For example, hours after the Mexico deal was announced, Trump continued to antagonize Canada, claiming the only thing it could do to avoid tariffs is become the 51st state \u2014 which Canada has repeatedly said it would not do.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see ... Canada become our 51st state,\u201d Trump said in an Oval Office meeting with reporters when he was asked what Canada could do to end the pending trade war. \u201cWe give them protection, military protection. We don\u2019t need them to build our cars \u2014 I\u2019d rather see Detroit or South Carolina ... or any one of our states build the cars.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke shortly before he was scheduled to have his second call of the day with outgoing Canadian Prime Minster Justin Trudeau. Unlike from Mexico, little fentanyl comes across the U.S.-Canadian border. Trudeau told reporters Saturday night that it is less than 1% of all the supply in the United States.",
      "A 30-day delay on tariffs on Canada was announced Monday afternoon after that second call. Trudeau said he had a \u201cgood call with President Trump,\" who has used him as a political bogeyman for months. As part of the deal, Trudeau said the country would spend $1.3 billion on a border security plan and appoint a \u201cfentanyl czar.\u201d",
      "The Canadian government first proposed the border security funding part of the plan last year.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Canadian government did not reply to a request seeking comment about whether the already proposed plan was used as part of the deal with Trump.",
      "The White House did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "Most congressional Republicans have not commented publicly on whether they support Trump\u2019s push for tariffs on historic political and economic allies, with a few exceptions. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was the first to chime in Monday morning when he took to X to \u201cplead\u201d with Trump to consider tariffs\u2019 impacts on his agriculture-heavy state.",
      "\u201cBiden inflation increase the input cost to farming by 20% incl particularly high prices on fertilizer,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cSo I plead w President Trump to exempt potash from the tariff because family farmers get most of our potash from Canada.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Newsmax that he shares \u201cthe market\u2019s concern\u201d about long-term tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt Americans, American companies, American exporters. It will hurt American consumers long term,\u201d he said.",
      "While Trump brokered 30-day reprieves with Canada and Mexico, it is unclear how the tariff fight will end with them, and the threats against China \u2014 by far the largest economy of the three \u2014 were not resolved Monday.",
      "China has said\u00a0it will challenge the tariffs at the World Trade Organization and pursue \u201ccountermeasures\u201d in response.",
      "There is little indication that Republican senators will start to speak out in large numbers against Trump\u2019s threats of trade wars, even if there is a prolonged fight on the issue.",
      "\u201cThere might be a few,\u201d said a political adviser to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. \u201cBut generally, I think there is a sense that Trump holds all the cards here. To the extent there is concern about home state constituencies, I think a lot of that will be expressed quietly and behind the scenes.\u201d",
      "Another veteran Republican familiar with Thune\u2019s thinking said he is unlikely to react in any overtly public or rash way.",
      "\u201cThese are U.S. senators. They have egos like everyone else,\u201d the person said. \u201cSen. Thune approaches things differently. He is more of a read-the-room guy. I\u2019d not expect him to act impulsively on anything, including this.\u201d",
      "The impacts of potential tariffs, for now, have been averted, but the future remains unclear, which leaves uncertainty both in the United States and around the globe. U.S. markets fell early Monday, but they quickly rebounded after the one-month Mexico pause was announced.",
      "Though Trump ran on the promise that tariffs would be good for the nation, in recent days, he has begun to acknowledge that if they are fully implemented there would be some short-term pain. But he now argues that those bumps and bruises would be beneficial to the nation in the long run.",
      "\u201cWill there be some pain? Yes, maybe (and maybe not!),\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cBut we will make America great again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid. We are a country that is now being run with common sense \u2014 and the results will be spectacular!!!\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Marco Rubio has empowered a top official at the State Department to run the U.S. Agency for International Development and begin reviewing all of the work done by the government agency targeted for dismantling by President Donald Trump and tech billionaire adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Rubio tapped Pete Marocco, the director of foreign assistance at the State Department, to begin reviewing all of the work done by USAID. He also warned that certain projects or programs might be suspended or eliminated.",
      "Marocco held several national security positions during the first Trump administration, including at USAID, where his attempts to consolidate power and slash funding drove officials to write a dissent memo that ultimately pushed him out of office, according to multiple sources who spoke with NBC News.",
      "Marocco has worked closely with the administration\u2019s other political appointees at USAID during the first weeks of Trump's second term, two current USAID officials with knowledge of the agency\u2019s new leadership structure and a source familiar with USAID\u2019s day-to-day operations said.",
      "Other people familiar with the agency\u2019s operations say Marocco has largely directed the downsizing of the agency from afar.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s doing now is frighteningly similar to everything he was trying to do at USAID before, but this time he\u2019s destroying it,\u201d said a USAID official familiar with Marocco's past actions.",
      "\u201cIf someone in the private sector did this with no mitigation plan, their stakeholders would go ape s---,\u201d a USAID staffer said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been responsible for building anything ever. He\u2019s very good at turning things off and questioning things and making people feel uncomfortable. He\u2019s taken apart a lot of things.\u201d",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those characterizations of Marocco, who has also been tied to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "In early 2023, online sleuths who aided the FBI in cases against hundreds of Jan. 6 rioters identified Marocco and his now-wife as being among the rioters who stormed the Capitol in 2021, pointing to multiple images of them on the Capitol grounds that day and CCTV video that shows the man they identified as Marocco entering the Capitol through a broken window.",
      "Photos of the person who entered the building were a strong facial recognition match for publicly available images of Marocco, online sleuths said. Marocco, like hundreds of others whom sleuths identified as people who entered the Capitol, was not charged before Trump pardoned all Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Marocco did not respond to a request for comment. Reached by D Magazine last year, he did not deny that he entered the Capitol, but he referred to \u201csmear tactics and desperate personal attacks.\u201d",

      "\u201cUSAID has numerous conflicting, overlapping, and duplicative functions that is shares with the Department of State. Additionally, USAID\u2019s systems and processes are not well synthesized, integrated, or coordinated and often result in discord in the foreign policy and foreign relations of the United States,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cThis undermines the President\u2019s abilities to carry out foreign relations.\u201d",
      "Marocco\u2019s review could lead to the \u201csuspension or elimination of programs, projects or activities; closing or suspending missions or post; closing, reorganizing, downsizing, or renaming establishments, organizations, bureaus, centers, or offices; reducing the size of the workforce at such entities and contracting out or privatizing functions or activities performed by Federal employees,\u201d Rubio added.",
      "Trump administration officials are actively considering placing USAID under the State Department\u2019s authority, more than a dozen current and former officials and sources familiar with the discussions have said. As of Monday, USAID\u2019s website no longer loads on the web, resulting in a message that its server IP address cannot be found.",

      "The message said agency personnel who normally work at USAID's headquarters \"will work remotely tomorrow\" except for people who perform essential on-site and building maintenance duties. \"Further guidance will be forthcoming,\" it said.",
