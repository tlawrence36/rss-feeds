    "story": [
      "Walter Salles' film \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d tells the story of Eunice Paiva after the disappearance of her husband",
      "It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the Paiva family. Filmmaker Walter Salles makes sure of that in \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d",
      "He drops the audience into the warm everyday of the beautiful home of Eunice (Fernanda Torres) and Rubens Paiva (Selton Mello), in 1970s Rio de Janeiro, where their five kids run freely between the beach and their living room. Life is calmly chaotic, full of affection, gentle familial teasing and various life stages (one is about to lose a tooth, another about to go to university). Someone always seems to have wet hair, be covered in sand, or bringing in a mangy stray, as their youngest, Marcelo, does in the film\u2019s lovely opening. Even if their life is technically worlds away from any one person in the audience, it feels familiar and close.",
      "Anyone coming to \u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d will surely know that this domestic tranquility does not and cannot hold. It was about seven years into Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship, which would last until 1985. And while the film suggests that there was a semblance of normalcy in their day to day, there are also ominous signs of change and oppression \u2014 reports of ambassadors being kidnapped on the news, and tense \u201crandom\u201d traffic stops that their eldest daughter endures one night. Some left-leaning citizens are making plans to leave, but the Paiva family is not in a terrible rush. They\u2019re even making plans to build a new home.",
      "So when three men in civilian clothes enter their home one afternoon and tell Rubens, a former left-leaning congressman, that he needs to come in for questioning, it happens with little incident. Everyone is on guard \u2014 they\u2019re not naive \u2014 but you sense that Eunice believes he will come back that night. Maybe even the next day. Rubens is calm changing into a collared shirt and tie and lying to his daughter that he is going into the office, even though it\u2019s a holiday. But he also savors this moment with her, perhaps because he knows he\u2019s likely to not return.",
      "The film is based on a memoir written by Paiva\u2019s son, Marcelo, but you don\u2019t need to know that to know that it is first and foremost a memory piece. It is deeply personal and imbued with the kind of tenderness that is extremely difficult to see or appreciate in the moment. And although it\u2019s certainly idealized and wistful, we accept any assumed white lies because we all wish that for ourselves: to truly recognize what we have before it\u2019s gone.",
      "This story is not about the abduction, however, or what may have happened to Rubens after that day. It\u2019s about how Eunice continues on, through uncertainty, absence and, ultimately, the loss of hope. Salles chooses to tell this story in a rather straightforward manner, which works well, allowing the compelling narrative and the talented actors to carry the audience through.",
      "At the heart of it is Torres, who has already won a Golden Globe for her performance and whose portrayal of Eunice is a true marvel. Mothers and wives often get the short shrift in movies like this, about Big Important Topics decided on by men, but Torres instills Eunice with a deep emotional and practical intelligence that\u2019s beautifully feminine, whether she\u2019s dealing with a misogynist banker, a dead dog in the street or the thugs surveilling her home. She\u2019s fascinating and resilient in a way that so many women are in times of historical strife but rarely celebrated for.",
      "In one particularly poignant scene, she and the kids are being photographed by a journalist hoping to tell their story. They smile together, as they did earlier in the film when Rubens was there. Now he\u2019s not, and the reporters are confused. They ask Eunice to try a more serious expression. She laughs, \u201cThey want us to look sad,\u201d and instructs her kids to keep smiling. It\u2019s a perfect encapsulation of the complex spirit of the movie. Political disappearances don\u2019t begin and end with the victim, or the toppling of a regime \u2014 they are generational traumas that live on in the survivors and alter everything in their wake.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in limited release Friday (expanding on Jan. 24), is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csmoking, drug use, brief nudity, some strong language, thematic content.\u201d Running time: 135 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "The collection includes behind-the-scenes rehearsal notes, scripts and photographs of iconic characters and sketches from a show that launched the careers of comedians Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and others. It also includes some of 80-year-old Michaels' personal correspondence.",

      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing",
      "Horror, not comedy, has been the go-to movie genre in recent years, but a movie like \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d starring Keke Palmer and, in her big-screen debut, SZA, is a good reminder of what we\u2019ve been missing.",
      "Creepy stuff and jump scares, we\u2019ve been told, have proved better suited for channeling our abiding contemporary dread. But the communal joys of big-screen comedy have, and always will, suit dark days as much as light ones, if not more so. \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d for instance, happens to arrive while Los Angeles, where the movie is set, has been decimated by wildfires. The Southern California skies, though, are crystal clear in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d In the opening moments, someone says, \u201cIt\u2019s always cooler on the West side.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d which had its premiere cancelled by the fires, is a welcome warm breeze for a movie landscape that has largely frozen out the comedy. There\u2019s one overwhelming reason for this: Keke Palmer.",
      "This is a buddy comedy, so it might seem unfair to single out one half of a duo. SZA, in her first feature, acquits herself well. But this is Palmer\u2019s show.",
      "Palmer plays Dreux, a Los Angeles waitress who, when her artist roommate Alyssa (SZA) gives their rent money to an untrustworthy boyfriend, Keshawn (Joshua David Neal), goes on a madcap, day-long odyssey to raise the money before they\u2019re evicted. This seemingly low-stakes premise is itself a kind of throwback to a more 1990s-flavored movie. The antic spirit of F. Gary Gray\u2019s \u201cFriday\u201d can be felt throughout \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d",
      "The tone here, courtesy of director Lawrence Lamont, producer Issa Rae and screenwriter Syreeta Singleton, is amiably realistic. Aside from a few cartoonish flourishes, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is grounded in a working-class reality where every step toward upward mobility for Dreux and Alyssa is swiftly knocked backward.",
      "They live in a dilapidated apartment complex in the neighborhood of Baldwin Village, nicknamed the Jungles. When they\u2019re forced to raise $1,500 \u2014 a race complete with a ticking-clock countdown to eviction, and, as things develop, until \u201ccertain death\u201d \u2014 Dreux is also scheduled for the biggest job interview of her life, to become a franchise manager for the restaurant chain she\u2019s employed by.",
      "The satire of \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d is mostly directed at the feeble opportunities afforded to those striving to break out of a paycheck-to-paycheck cycle. When the roommates seek a loan, their payday center advertises a comical APR of 1,900.5%. (The agent, who takes great pleasure in their credit scores, is memorably played by Keyla Monterroso Mejia.)",
      "That\u2019s just one of the characters the two encounter in their pleasantly meandering journey to raise money via everything from blood donation to Air Jordans hung on power lines. Some of the characters along the way include Katt Williams, as a conscientious homeless man who warns against predatory lending; Vanessa Bell Calloway\u2019s stripper-turned-blood-bank-worker; a new white neighbor named Bethany (Maude Apatow); and Keshawn\u2019s new hook-up (Janelle James), who proves the movie\u2019s most regular villain, despite the looming presence of a fearsome gangster (Amin Joseph).",
      "Anyone familiar with Rae\u2019s \u201cInsecure\u201d will recognize some of the hallmarks of that HBO series, namely the struggles of Black women trying to get a leg up in Los Angeles while also juggling romantic interests that might come from a wide range of backgrounds. Here, that\u2019s Dreux\u2019s crush, Maniac (Patrick Cage), who drives a Mercedes and who she suspects is a criminal.",
      "If all of this sounds somewhat low stakes (I failed to mention Lil Rel Howery as their prospective sneaker buyer), that\u2019s more of a pleasing feature than a bug in \u201cOne of Them Days.\u201d Besides, filling this movie with anything more \u2014 star cameos or broad comedy set pieces \u2014 would be a mistake. That would leave less room for the interplay between Palmer and SZA.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d hinges on central buddy comedy, which Lamont seems to recognize even in his feature directorial debut. SZA\u2019s uber-cool unsurprisingly transfers easily to the big screen; her performance is winning because it\u2019s so unforced.",
      "But it\u2019s a testament to Palmer\u2019s dynamism as a performer that \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d would work no matter where their day takes them. There\u2019s a freewheeling wit and ever-shifting subtlety to Palmer, who so enlivened Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope.\u201d Only a theatrical comedy can really showcase charisma like hers. For an actress who\u2019s hustled to get to this point, \u201cOne of Them\u201d days is perfect platform for Palmer, scrappy and unstoppable.",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language throughout, sexual material and brief drug use. Running time: 97 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "A hip-hop superstar beef was cranked up another notch Wednesday when Drake sued Universal Music Group for defamation over rival Kendrick Lamar's diss track \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York City, alleges UMG published and promoted the track even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice. Lamar is not named in the suit.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home, as well as online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and decreasing his brand's value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The company has contracts with both stars.",
      "\u201cThe lawsuit is not about the artist who created \u2018Not Like Us,\u2019\" the lawsuit says, referring to Lamar. \u201cIt is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\u201d",
      "The suit later alleges, \u201cUMG did so because it understood that the Recording's inflammatory and shocking allegations were a gold mine.\u201d",
      "And, the suit claims, the music company has made large investments and used its connections to arrange for \u201cNot Like Us\u201d to be performed at next month's Super Bowl, where Lamar will be the halftime entertainment.",
      "The lawsuit, which is seeking a trial and an undisclosed amount of money for damages, also repeated allegations in other legal filings that UMG falsely pumped up the popularity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d on streaming services.",
      "Representatives for Drake declined to comment Wednesday. Representatives for UMG and Lamar did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "In a previous statement responding to similar allegations in pre-litigation filings, the record company said the \u201csuggestion that UMG would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue. We employ the highest ethical practices in our marketing and promotional campaigns.\u201d",
      "The feud between Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner, is among the biggest in hip-hop in recent years, with two of the genre\u2019s biggest stars at its center.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year.",
      "Drake's lawyers, from New York-based Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said the lawsuit seeks to hold UMG accountable for knowingly promoting false and defamatory allegations against him."

      "It will not, of course, because this is a Blumhouse movie called \u201cWolf Man.\u201d It will not be good for Blake and it will not be good for the audience. That's because this film is a terrible misfire using a classic movie monster poorly rebooted by the modern home of horror.",
      "Slack when it should be terrifying, \u201cWolf Man\u201d suffers from cheap sentimentality, laughably obvious script reveals, poor continuity and a creature that is less predatory than painful. Pity comes to mind.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman released a statement Wednesday denying he had ever engaged in non-consensual sex after a magazine this week published allegations from several women, accusing him of sexual assault.",
      "The 64-year-old author of \u201cThe Sandman\u201d comic book series and novel \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was responding to a New York Magazine article that detailed allegations of assault, abuse and coercion leveled by eight women. The allegations of four of them had been broadcast in July in a Tortoise Media podcast.",

      "\u201cAnd I also realise, looking through them, years later, that I could have and should have done so much better. I was emotionally unavailable while being sexually available, self-focused and not as thoughtful as I could or should have been. I was obviously careless with people\u2019s hearts and feelings, and that\u2019s something that I really, deeply regret,\u201d Gaiman said.",
      "Most of the allegations relate to occasions when Gaiman was in his 40s or older and living in the United States, Britain and New Zealand.",
      "One of the accusers, Scarlett Pavlovich, told New York Magazine she met Gaiman through his then-wife, U.S. performer Amanda Palmer, on a New Zealand island where the couple lived with their son in 2022. Pavlovich alleges Gaiman abused her several times starting the night they met.",
      "Some of Pavlovich\u2019s allegations were first made public six months earlier in the podcast.",
      "She told the magazine she filed a police report in January 2023 accusing Gaiman of sexual assault.",
      "New Zealand Police this week would not say whether Gaiman was, or had been, under investigation.",
      "\u201cIn general, Police cannot respond to queries which seek to establish whether specific individuals are, or have been, under Police investigation. Additionally, anyone who makes a complaint to Police has the right to privacy,\u201d New Zealand Police told The Associated Press in an email on Tuesday.",
      "The AP\u2019s messages to Gaiman\u2019s agent, his office and to Bloomsbury, publisher of several of his recent books, were not returned.",
      "Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which both have Gaiman-related projects scheduled for this year, haven't responded to the AP\u2019s messages.",
      "Several of Gaiman's works have been turned into movies and television programs."

      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing",
      "When the Palisades Fire broke out in Los Angeles last Tuesday, Hollywood\u2019s awards season was in full swing. The Golden Globes had transpired less than 48 hours earlier and a series of splashy awards banquets followed in the days after.",
      "But the enormity of the destruction in Southern California has quickly snuffed out all festiveness in the movie industry\u2019s high season of celebration. At one point, the flames even encroached on the hillside above the Dolby Theatre, the home of the Academy Awards.",
      "The fires have struck at the very heart of a movie industry still trying to stabilize itself after years of pandemic, labor turmoil and technological upheaval. Not for the first time this decade, the Oscars are facing the question of: Should the show go on? And if it does, what do they mean now?",
      "\u201cWith ALL due respect during Hollywood\u2019s season of celebration, I hope any of the networks televising the upcoming awards will seriously consider NOT televising them and donating the revenue they would have gathered to victims of the fires and the firefighters,\u201d \u201cHacks\u201d star Jean Smart, a recent Globe winner, wrote on Instagram.",
      "The Oscars remain as scheduled, but it\u2019s certain that they will be transformed due to the wildfires, and that most of the red-carpet pomp that typically stretches between now and then will be curtailed if not altogether canceled. With so many left without a home by the fires, there\u2019s scant appetite for the usual self-congratulatory parades of the season.",
      "Focus has turned, instead, to what the Oscars might symbolize for a traumatized Los Angeles. The Oscars have never meant less, but, at the same time, they might be more important than ever as a beacon of perseverance for the reeling movie capital.",
      "The film academy on Monday for the second time delayed its nominations announcement. Nominations will now be announced virtually on Feb. 23. The academy also canceled its annual nominees luncheon and said it\u2019s planning to honor frontline workers and to support relief efforts.",
      "\u201cWe will get through this together and bring a sense of healing to our global film community,\u201d vowed Bill Kramer, academy chief executive, and Janet Yang, academy president.",
      "The fires, one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history, continue. The ongoing nature of the crisis, which has killed at least 25 people, has made remaking well-laid plans a moving target. The Critics Choice Awards have been postponed. Nominations to the Producers Guild Awards have been delayed twice with no new date set. On Tuesday, the guild established a fund to support producers affected by the fires.",
      "The 67th Grammy Awards, scheduled to be held Feb. 2 in downtown Los Angeles, are going forward, albeit with significant changes. Harvey Mason jr., Recording Academy chief executive and Board of Trustees chair Tammy Hurt said this year's Grammys \u201cwill carry a renewed sense of purpose: raising additional funds to support wildfire relief efforts and honoring the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives to protect ours.\u201d",
      "Some telethon-like element also seems sure to accompany the Oscars. In recent days, many throughout the industry have voiced suggestions for how the broadcast could be reconsidered. A not dissimilar process happened during the 2021 Oscars, which were postponed to late April because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Oscars have been moved a few times throughout history, including in 1938, when the show was delayed a week due to historic flooding in Los Angeles.",
      "For the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the wildfires have been acutely personal. Four of the academy\u2019s 55-person board of governors lost their homes, according to The Hollywood Reporter, including producer Lynette Howell Taylor, visual effects governor Brooke Breton, sound branch governor Mark P. Stoeckinger and animation branch governor Jinko Gotoh. The Pacific Palisades, which was largely destroyed by the fires, was home to many stars and executives.",
      "For potential nominees, this would normally be when they\u2019d be at their most active, campaigning in Q&As and other events tied to the all-important nominations voting period. All of that has ground to a halt. Isabella Rossellini, who\u2019s favored to be nominated for best supporting actress for her performance in \u201cConclave,\u201d on Instagram posted a photograph of an Oscar lying in ashes. The photo turned out to be fake, but it accurately captured Hollywood\u2019s current mood.",
      "Several high-profile TV series were forced to pause production because of the fires but notably few movie shoots were affected. That, in itself, is a reflection of a Hollywood that has seen the majority of film production seek tax incentives in other states.",
      "Work throughout the film and TV industry hasn\u2019t rebounded following the 2023 strikes, leaving large numbers of crew members unemployed. So quiet are studio lots that actress Natalie Morales (\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d) has advocated for studios, in the wake of the fires, to turn empty soundstages into temporary classrooms, erected by out-of-work craftspeople, for children whose schools burned down.",
      "It\u2019s a reminder that many in the film business need all the work they can find, including all the jobs that accompany the Oscars. Not only are the Academy Awards a vital spotlight on a wide swath of movies that otherwise might struggle to find audiences, the awards provide a lot of jobs to an awards season industrial complex of workers, stylists and vendors.",
      "With so many out of work before the fires hit, Silvina Knight, an Emmy-winning makeup artist, calls this latest crisis \u201canother setback \u2013 a big one.\u201d She is currently working on \u201cSuits LA,\u201d one of the series that stopped filming due to the fires.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how people are going to feel about getting dressed up and when they just lost everything,\u201d said Knight of the Oscars. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, it might be a show of force when we come back. Yeah, this is tragic, but we are all coming together. Even driving home the other night, motorists were being very considerate of each other, which is unusual for Los Angeles.\u201d",

      "When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lucy Walker debuted her harrowing documentary about California wildfires, \u201cBring Your Own Brigade,\u201d at Sundance in 2021, it was during peak COVID. Not the best time for a film on a wholly different scourge.",
      "\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d the Oscar-nominated filmmaker says now. \u201cI didn\u2019t blame people for not wanting to watch a film about the fires in the middle of the pandemic, because it was just too much horror.\"",
      "And so the film, though acclaimed \u2014 it was named one of the 10 best films of the year by the New York Times \u2013 didn\u2019t reach an audience as large as Walker had hoped, with its urgent display of the human cost of wildfires and its tough, crucial questions for the future.",
      "That could change. Walker thinks people may now be more receptive to her message, given the devastating wildfires that have wrought havoc on Los Angeles itself the past week. Firefighters were preparing on Tuesday to attack new blazes amid warnings that winds combined with severely dry conditions created a \u201c particularly dangerous situation.\"",
      "\u201cThis is probably the moment where it becomes undeniable,\u201d she said in an interview.",
      "She added: \"It does feel like people are now asking the question that I was asking a few years ago, like, 'Is it safe to live in Los Angeles? And why is this happening, and what can we do about it? And the good news is that there are some things we can do about it. What\u2019s tricky is that they\u2019re really hard to accomplish.\u201d",
      "In \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\" (available on Paramount+), Walker portrays in sometimes terrifying detail the devastation caused by two wildfires on the same day in 2018, products of the same wind event \u2014 the Camp Fire that engulfed the northern California city of Paradise and the Woolsey fire in Malibu, two towns on opposite ends of the political and economic spectrum.",
      "She embeds herself with firefighters, and explores the lives of locals affected by the fire. She shares harrowing cellphone footage of people driving through exploding columns of fire as they try to escape, crying out \u201cI don\u2019t want to die!\u201d She plays 911 calls in which people plead vainly for rescue as fire laps at their backyards or invades their homes.",
      "And she conveys a layered message: Devastating fires in California are increasingly inevitable. Climate change is a clear accelerating factor, yes, but it\u2019s not the only one, and therein lies an element of hope: There are things people can do, if they start to make different (and difficult) choices \u2014 in both where and how they choose to live.",
      "But first, complacency must be vanquished.",
      "\u201cComplacency sets in when there hasn\u2019t been a fire for a few years and you start to think, it might not happen again,\u201d Walker says.",
      "It even affected Walker herself a few months ago. A British transplant to Los Angeles, she had chosen to live on the Venice-Santa Monica border \u2014 too scared, she says, to live in the city's lovely hilly areas with small winding roads, surrounded by nature and vegetation, near the canyons that wildfires love.",
      "But a few months ago, she started wondering if over-anxiety about wildfires had incorrectly influenced her choice. And then, of course, came the Palisades catastrophe \u2014\u201cthis God awful reminder that it only takes one event,\u201d she says.",
      "Walker became interested in making a film about wildfires after she arrived in the city and wondered if she was safe. \u201cWhy is the hillside on fire?\u201d she says she wondered. \u201cWhy do people just keep on driving?\u201d She had considered such fires \u201ca medieval problem.\"",
      "One thing she learned while filming: Firefighters were even more impressive and courageous than she'd thought. \u201cIf you want to watch a firefighter have their heart broken, it\u2019s when they want to do more,\u201d she says. \"I was just absolutely wowed by how incredibly selfless and brilliant they were.\u201d",
      "Not that the public wasn\u2019t angry at them \u2014 her film depicts angry residents of Malibu, for example, chastising firefighters for not doing enough.",
      "One of the most stunning parts of \u201cBring Your Own Brigade\u201d \u2014 the title is a reference to the economic inequity of wealthy homeowners or celebrities like Kim Kardashian hiring private firefighters \u2014 is watching the reaction of firefighters at a town meeting in Paradise, where 85 people had been killed in the fire. They've convened to discuss adopting safety measures as they rebuild. One by one, measures are rejected \u2014 even the simplest, requiring a five-foot buffer around every house where nothing is flammable. Safety takes a back burner to individual choice.",
      "\u201cIt was very shocking to be at that meeting in particular, given that people had died in the most horrible way in that community. And you have firefighters with tears in their eyes saying, 'This is what we need to have happen to keep us safe, and then (they) get voted down.\"",
      "Walker is not the only filmmaker to have made a film about Paradise. In 2020, Ron Howard directed \u201cRebuilding Paradise,\u201d focused on the effort to rebuild, and the resilience of residents. Walker says she looked at the same set of facts and arrived at different takeaways.",
      "Townspeople were indeed amazing and resilient, Walker says. \u201cBut are we right to be building back without a real rethink? Because the tragedy is that these fires are predictably going to be repeating and against the backdrop of climate change, they're getting worse, not better.\u201d",
      "That rethink involves making hard calls about where people should live. \u201cThe population is overwhelmingly moving into these wildland urban interface areas,\u201d Walker says, referring to areas where housing meets undeveloped wildland vegetation \u2014 exactly the areas most likely to burn.",
      "In California, some of these places are very expensive \u2014 like Palisades and Malibu \u2014 but others are in more affordable areas. With the great pressure on housing, more people are moving into such areas, she says. But the \u201cbraking mechanism\u201d could be that insurance companies \u201care doing the math, and it\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d",
      "It's not only a question of where people live.",
      "\u201cWhat does a fire-hardened home look like?\u201d Walker asks. \u201cDesign-wise, that that does dictate certain things.\u201d For example: \u201cThis lovely wood is going to require tremendous firefighting.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s too early to know, but Walker thinks she may be hearing something different now from those who've lost homes, of whom she knows many.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing from people is not just \u2018I can\u2019t wait to rebuild. Let me rebuild,'\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s: 'How could we go through that again?'\u201d"

      "Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand under controversy, has died at age 82",
      "MILAN -- Oliviero Toscani, the photographer behind Benetton\u2019s provocative ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s who later broke with the Italian knitwear brand amid controversy, died Monday at age 82.",
      "Toscani disclosed last year he had a rare disease. \"It is with immense pain that we announce that our beloved Oliviero has undertaken his next journey,\" his wife, Kirsti, and their three children said in a statement. He died at a hospital in Livorno, Tuscany, the news agency ANSA reported.",
      "Toscani had amyloidosis, a disease characterized by a buildup of abnormal protein deposits in the body. He told Corriere della Sera in August he had lost 40 kilograms (nearly 90 pounds) in a year, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I have left to live, but I\u2019m not interested in living like this anyway.\u201d",
      "Toscani also said he would like to be remembered \u201cnot for any one photo but for my whole work, for the commitment.\u201d",
      "Toscani was the creative force behind shock ad campaigns of the 1980s and 1990s that featured images such as the pope kissing an imam on the lips, which angered the Vatican.",
      "Other images promoting the United Colors of Benetton depicted a priest embracing a nun, a newborn baby with its umbilical cord and a black woman breastfeeding a white baby, part of the brand\u2019s advocacy for diversity, religious tolerance and environmental messages.",
      "During a 1997 shoot of a Benetton campaign featuring Jews and Arabs living peacefully together in Israel, Toscani told The Associated Press, \u201cAny picture is a political image, so we make our choice and we go for the real thing.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cYou might have to face criticism. A lot of people don\u2019t like things that are different. Everybody likes to conform. We don\u2019t conform.\u201d",
      "His decadeslong relationship with Benetton was severed in 2020 after Toscani outraged relatives of victims of the deadly 2018 Genoa bridge collapse, telling RAI television, \u201cWho cares about a bridge collapse?\u201d He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family, which controlled the company that maintained the bridge.",
      "Toscani apologized in an interview with La Repubblica, saying: \u201cI am sorry. More: I am ashamed to apologize. I am humanly destroyed and deeply pained.\u201d But the damage was done, and Benetton ended a relationship that had flourished from 1982-2000 and been rekindled in 2018.",
      "Benetton remembered Toscani in a social media post: \u201cFarewell, Oliviero. Keep on dreaming,\u2019\u2019 beneath Toscani's 1989 photo of a hand offering a bouquet of flowers.",
      "Toscani was born in Milan on Feb. 28, 1942, the son of a photojournalist for Corriere della Sera. He studied photography and graphics at the University of the Arts in Zurich from 1961-65, and worked with the newly founded Vogue Italia and other major fashion publications.",
      "Over the years, he shot campaigns for such brands as Chanel, Robe di Kappa, Fiorucci and Esprit. But he was probably best known for his work for the United Colors of Benetton, with images that carried messages promoting equality and diversity while denouncing anorexia, homophobia, the death penalty and racism.",
      "His work for United Colors of Benetton, a brand then known most for its colorful knitwear, raised its global profile. In the early 1990s, he conceived and directed \u201cColors,\u201d a global publication distributed in Benetton stores, and created along with Luciano Benetton the research center Fabrica in Benetton\u2019s home city of Treviso that supported and launched many fashion industry careers.",
      "Toscani tackled the AIDS crisis in the early 1990s with a colored condom campaign, during which Benetton sold a range of colored condoms, and used a colorized version of a portrait of AIDS activist David Kirby surrounded by family as he was dying.",
      "In 2007, Toscani\u2019s \u201cNo Anorexia\u201d campaign for the Italian fashion brand Nolita sparked fresh discussions about the illness and its relationship to the fashion industry. Toscani\u2019s photograph with skeletally thin model Isabelle Caro was revealed on giant billboards and in newspaper ads during Milan Fashion Week and received worldwide attention.",
      "He was also involved in projects addressing problems such as road safety, violence against women and stray dogs.",

    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin,\u2019\u201d has died",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \u201cSoul Man\u201d and \u201cHold On, I'm Comin,\u2019\u201d has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \u201ccall and response\u201d of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music\u2019s most enduring hits, which also included \u201cYou Don\u2019t Know Like I Know,\u201d \u201cWhen Something is Wrong With My Baby\u201d and \u201cI Thank You.\u201d",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music\u2019s most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \u201cPlay it, Steve\u201d midway through \u201cSoul Man.\u201d",
      "Like many \u201960s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \u201cSoul Man\u201d hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \u201cSoul Men\u201d depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\u201cTwo thousand dollars for my lifetime?\u201d Moore said then. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don\u2019t give me cornbread and tell me it\u2019s biscuits.\u201d",
      "Moore wrote the song \u201cDole Man,\u201d modeled on \u201cSoul Man,\u201d for Republican Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama\u2019s campaign used the song \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Comin\u2019.\u201d",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s, but didn\u2019t meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label\u2019s Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band\u2019s troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "\u201cI did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I\u2019m laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\u201d",
      "Moore is survive by his wife, Joyce, daughter, Michell, and two grandchildren.",

      "A group of Democratic state attorneys general are asking a court to let them defend a federal policy to allow young adult immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d to access subsidized health care",
      "A group of Democratic attorneys general asked a court on Wednesday to let them defend a federal policy that opened subsidized health coverage to \u201cDreamers,\" young adults who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.",
      "They want to take up the mantle since they anticipate President-elect Donald Trump's administration will not do so after he takes office on Monday.",
      "The request in U.S. District Court in Bismarck, North Dakota, is among the first of what are expected to be many legal skirmishes over policy as the presidency changes hands. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin is leading 14 Democratic prosecutors in the health care effort.",
      "\u201cUndermining Dreamers\u2019 access to healthcare not only hurts them and their American children, but it harms states like New Jersey too,\u201d Platkin said in a statement. \"We will never back down from fighting for our Dreamers, no matter who is in charge in Washington.\u201d",
      "For decades, states have often sued the the federal government \u2014 particularly when it's under control of the opposing party \u2014 over policy. Democratic attorneys general are also preparing to do just that. There could also be more requests like Wednesday's to let states defend actions taken by the Biden administration.",
      "If a judge allows the Democratic attorneys general to intervene in this case, it would set up a legal battle between red and blue states.",
      "A group of 19 Republican attorneys general, led by Kansas's Kris Kobach, sued over a federal regulation adopted last year to allow an estimated 147,000 immigrants eligible for coverage through the Affordable Care Act's public marketplace. They assert that the ACA and a 1996 law prohibit U.S. government benefits from flowing to immigrants who are in the country illegally.",
      "A federal judge in North Dakota ruled last month that the immigrants would not be allowed to obtain the coverage in the states that sued while the case moves forward. Members of the group in other states can now get coverage.",
      "The \u201cDreamers\u201d are part of a program that makes them a low priority for deportation. In his first term as president, Trump had varying stances on the program. He attempted to end it but was thwarted by the Supreme Court.",
      "More recently, he has promised \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history\u201d when he takes office and and also said he would look for ways for Dreamers to stay in the U.S.",
      "Last week, Biden's administration extended Temporary Protected Status to allow people from Venezuela, El Salvador, Ukraine and Sudan to remain in the U.S. legally for another 18 months."

    "summary": "U.S. regulators are banning the dye called Red 3 from the food supply",
    "story": [
      "U.S. regulators are banning the dye called Red 3 from the food supply",
      "U.S. regulators on Wednesday banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "Food and Drug Administration officials granted a 2022 petition filed by two dozen food safety and health advocates, who urged the agency to revoke authorization for the substance that gives some candies, snack cakes and maraschino cherries a bright red hue.",
      "The agency said it was taking the action as a \u201cmatter of law\u201d because some studies have found that the dye caused cancer in lab rats. Officials cited a statute known as the Delaney Clause, which requires FDA to ban any additive found to cause cancer in people or animals.",
      "The dye is known as erythrosine, FD&C Red No. 3 or Red 3. The ban removes it from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements and oral medicines, such as cough syrups. More than three decades ago, the FDA declined to authorize use of Red 3 in cosmetics and externally applied drugs because a study showed it caused cancer when eaten by rats.",
      "\u201cThe FDA is taking action that will remove the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods. \u201cEvidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No.3. Importantly, the way that FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in male rats does not occur in humans.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers will have until January 2027 to remove the dye from their products, while makers of ingested drugs have until January 2028 to do the same. Other countries still allow for certain uses of the dye, but imported foods must meet the new U.S. requirement.",
      "Consumer advocates praised the decision.",
      "\u201cThis is a welcome, but long overdue, action from the FDA: removing the unsustainable double standard in which Red 3 was banned from lipstick but permitted in candy,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, director of the group Center for Science in the Public Interest, which led the petition effort.",
      "It's not clear whether the ban will face legal challenges from food manufacturers because evidence hasn\u2019t determined that the dye causes cancer when consumed by humans. At a hearing in December, FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf suggested that's a risk.",
      "\u201cWhen we do ban something, it will go to court,\u201d he told members of Congress on Dec. 5. \u201cAnd if we don't have the scientific evidence, we will lose in court.\u201d",
      "When the FDA declined to allow Red 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs in 1990, the color additive was already permitted in foods and ingested drugs. Because research showed then that the way the dye causes cancer in rats does not apply to humans, \"the FDA did not take action to revoke the authorization of Red No. 3 in food,\u201d the agency has said on its website.",
      "Health advocates for years have asked the FDA to reconsider that decision, including the 2022 petition led by CSPI. In November, nearly two dozen members of Congress sent a letter demanding that FDA officials ban Red 3.",
      "Lawmakers cited the Delaney Clause and said the action was especially important to protect children, who consume more of the dye on a bodyweight basis than adults, the lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cThe FDA should act quickly to protect the nation's youth from this harmful dye, used simply to give food and drinks a bright red color,\u201d the letter said. \u201cNo aesthetic reason could justify the use of a carcinogen in our food supply.\u201d",
      "Red 3 is banned for food use in Europe, Australia and New Zealand except in certain kinds of cherries. The dye will be banned in California starting in January 2027.",
      "The International Association of Color Manufacturers defends the dye, saying that it is safe in levels typically consumed by humans. The group points to research by scientific committees operated by the United Nations and the World Health Organization, including a 2018 review that reaffirmed the safety of Red 3 in food.",
      "Some food manufacturers have already reformulated products to remove Red 3. In its place they use beet juice; carmine, a dye made from insects; and pigments from foods such as purple sweet potato, radish and red cabbage, according to Sensient Food Colors, a St. Louis-based supplier of food colors and flavorings.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:22:40 -0500",
    "summary": "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is floating a long-awaited proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine levels",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal officials on Wednesday released a far-reaching proposal to make cigarettes less addictive by capping their nicotine content, a goal long sought by antismoking advocates that is unlikely to go into effect anytime soon.",
      "The proposed rule from the Food and Drug Administration comes in the final days of President Joe Biden\u2019s term, greatly reducing the likelihood that it will actually be enacted. President-elect Donald Trump and his health nominees have not commented on the measure, but a similar effort led by Trump\u2019s first FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, was sidelined during his first term.",
      "Trump\u2019s health secretary nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has said little about how regulating tobacco fits into his plans to overhaul the government's approach to fighting chronic disease. Even if the effort goes ahead under Trump, tobacco companies like Reynolds American and Altria are almost certain to challenge it in court, delaying implementation.",
      "The FDA has spent years studying the issue and said Wednesday that reducing nicotine would help nearly 13 million current smokers quit cigarettes within one year. Roughly 48 million more young people would never take up the habit because cigarettes would essentially become nonaddictive, according to agency projections.",
      "Under the agency's plan, nicotine would be capped at levels that \u201ccould no longer create and sustain this addiction among people who smoke.\u201d The agency's 334-page analysis was posted online in the federal register Wednesday morning.",
      "Antismoking advocates overwhelmingly back the idea and urged Kennedy to help implement it, if he is confirmed.",
      "\u201cTobacco regulation is a huge part of reaching the goals he\u2019s outlined for reducing chronic disease and a really important part of the conversation we need to have in this country,\u201d said Chrissie Juliano of the Big Cities Health Coalition, which represents the heads of more than 30 metropolitan health departments",
      "Smoking causes more than 480,000 U.S. deaths each year due to cancer, heart disease, stroke and other smoking-related illnesses. Those conditions often take decades to develop and remain elevated today despite ongoing declines in smoking among adults and teenagers.",
      "The idea of limiting nicotine has its roots in sweeping powers given to the FDA by Congress in 2009 to regulate the tobacco industry. But the FDA\u2019s efforts on nicotine and a host of other tobacco measures \u2014 such as adding graphic warning labels to cigarette packs \u2014 have been hampered for years by tobacco industry lawsuits.",
      "Under the law, FDA regulators can regulate nicotine but they cannot remove it completely. The agency's ability to set a maximum nicotine threshold is unique worldwide and the attempt would represent a first in global efforts to reduce smoking-related deaths.",
      "Currently, there are no U.S. limits on nicotine, which occurs naturally in tobacco plants. There are several techniques for removing it, including chemical extraction and cross-breeding plants.",
      "The FDA formally announced it would begin work on the proposed rule in 2022 and regulators received thousands of public comments from tobacco companies, retailers, health experts and consumers.",
      "The latest FDA announcement comes as smoking in the U.S. continues to fall. Last year, the smoking rate hit another all-time low of just 1 in 9 adults saying they currently smoke.",
      "Low-nicotine cigarettes are not a new idea. Several companies, including Philip Morris, experimented with selling the products during the 1980s and 1990s, without much success. In 2019, the FDA authorized a cigarette that contains 95% less nicotine than standard cigarettes.",
      "The FDA has sponsored studies showing that when smokers switch to very low nicotine cigarettes they smoke less and are more likely to try quitting. That research is considered pivotal to establishing that smokers won\u2019t compensate by just smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more deeply. That was sometimes the case with \u201clight\u201d and \u201clow tar\u201d cigarettes marketed in decades past. Those products were subsequently banned as misleading.",

      "\u201cAny minute anybody could cough, just incidentally,\u201d said Scarbro, who lives in Sunset Beach, North Carolina. \u201cAnd that cough could be the one thing that could make me sick.\u201d",
      "This month marks the fifth anniversary of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. The virus would go on to kill 1.2 million Americans and disrupt countless lives.",

They protect themselves from the virus with masks and isolate themselves in small family bubbles. Some grasp for unproven strategies \u2014 gargling with antiseptic mouthwash, carrying a personal carbon dioxide monitor to check the ventilation of indoor spaces.",

      "\u201cThere was more respect and understanding, but now they\u2019re over it,\" she said. \"They expect me to be over it, but they don\u2019t understand that even before COVID-19, these were the precautions I needed to take.\u201d",
      "Most Americans have developed some level of protection against severe disease from previous COVID-19 infections, vaccinations or both.

      "Before the pandemic, Bazia Zebrowski, 61, of Newbury, Ohio, dined out, shopped for groceries and took her dog, Shadoh, to the park. When she felt well, she occasionally could get together with friends despite having myalgic encephalomyelitis, a condition formerly known as chronic fatigue syndrome that causes inflammation, immune system problems, fatigue and pain.",
      "Now she keeps close to home, venturing out only for medical appointments. Her husband does the shopping and wears a mask at his workplace.",
      "They have not had COVID-19 and hope their luck holds. Getting sick would be a disaster, she said, potentially triggering a relapse or superimposing long COVID-19 onto her illness.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t consider myself COVID cautious. I consider myself COVID competent,\u201d Zebrowski said. \u201cCautious would imply that I have an unreasonable fear of something. I do not have an unreasonable fear of this disease.\u201d",
      "What does Zebrowski miss about pre-pandemic times? \u201cI miss the illusion that people are willing to care for each other,\u201d she said. \u201cHow hard is it to put a mask on? It rattles your faith in humankind \u2026 (you learn) how little the people in your life understood how sick you were to begin with.\u201d",

      "Tossing aside the threat of long COVID is hard to imagine for Yale University immunologist Akiko Iwasaki.

      "Sierra Leone has declared a state of emergency after reporting its second case of mpox in less than four days",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Sierra Leone declared a state of emergency Monday after the country reported its second case of mpox in less than four days, health authorities said.",
      "Neither case had known recent contact with infected animals or other sick individuals, the health ministry said. Only the first case involved recent travel, limited to the airport town of Lungi in the northern Port Loko District between Dec. 26 and Jan. 6th. Both patients are receiving treatment at a hospital in the capital, Freetown.",
      "Mpox, also known as monkeypox, was first identified by scientists in 1958 when outbreaks of a \u201cpox-like\u201d disease in monkeys occurred. Until recently, most human cases were seen in people in central and West Africa who had close contact with infected animals.",
      "In 2022, the virus was confirmed to spread via sex for the first time and triggered outbreaks in more than 70 countries across the world that had not previously reported mpox. The Congo has borne the brunt of the epidemic, with a vast majority of the roughly 43,000 suspected cases and 1,000 deaths in Africa this year.",
      "Sierra Leone was previously the epicenter of the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the deadliest in history. The outbreak, primarily concentrated in West Africa, affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak.",

      "",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, MD, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity. In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "",
      "An estimated 2.3 million people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a healthcare consulting company. That number is expected to as much as double in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a report by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about half of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following 3 years.",
      "",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric hand she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said.",

      "To age well, geriatricians say one underappreciated key is maintaining good balance",
      "Taking a shower. Grocery shopping. Moving around the kitchen. Getting dressed. The underappreciated link between these mundane activities is good balance, which geriatricians say is key to maintaining an independent lifestyle as we age.",
      "Lacking balance can be dangerous. In the U.S., 3 million older people seek medical care for fall-related injuries each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control. But falls are not inevitable, said Roopa Anmolsingh, a geriatrician who created the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s balance classes.",
      "\u201cSome people have a misconception that part of getting old is, you\u2019re going to fall. That\u2019s not true,\u201d Anmolsingh said. \u201cYou can control how you fall, or if you fall.\u201d",
      "To prevent falls, geriatricians say people should start asking themselves questions about their balance as early as 50 years old.",
      "Besides muscles and bones, other systems in the body can affect balance, so it\u2019s important to have a doctor check you if you ever feel unsteady, even if only occasionally. The cause could be related to blood pressure, a medication, inner-ear function, a nervous system issue or countless other potential problems.",
      "Even if unsteadiness is not an issue, you can determine whether you still might need an intervention with an easy at-home assessment.",
      "Standing next to a wall or something that can lend support if needed, raise one leg. If you can balance on each leg for 10 seconds, you should be fine, said Greg W. Hartley, a University of Miami professor of physical therapy specializing in geriatrics.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then you should probably go see a physical therapist,\u201d he said.",
      "Another assessment, which Hartley recommended doing supervised, is called TUG, for \u201ctimed up and go.\u201d Sit in a chair and start a timer when you stand. Walk 10 feet (3 meters), come back and stop the timer upon sitting back down. If it takes longer than 15 seconds, the risk for a fall is very high. Twelve seconds or less, the likelihood of a fall is almost zero.",
      "The National Council on Aging offers an online resource to assess the risk of a fall with questions about medications, whether you worry about falling and if you have trouble stepping over a curb, among others.",
      "Because muscle mass begins to decline in most people during their 30s, geriatricians say the best way to preserve good balance is to stay physically active throughout life. But it\u2019s never too late to start prioritizing it, Anmolsingh said.",
      "Tai chi and yoga are particularly good for older adults because they involve controlled movements while shifting body weight. There also are individual exercises people can work into their everyday lives.",
      "Anmolsingh recommended standing on one foot while waiting in line at the grocery store. At home, try sitting up and down from a chair several times without using arm rests. While holding onto a chair or the wall, do three-way leg lifts on each side, lifting a leg to the front, side and then back. At the kitchen counter, take a few steps to the side in each direction.",
      "For general physical activity, which will improve balance as well as mood and overall health, the National Institute of Aging recommends at least 150 minutes per week. That should include a mixture of stretching to improve flexibility, an aerobic activity increasing the heart rate and strength training with weights or resistance bands.",
      "For balance-specific exercises, it\u2019s particularly important to do them regularly because it takes at least 50 hours of training to have a measurable impact, Hartley said. Besides strengthening the associated muscles, doing exercises repetitively for extended periods trains the brain to react properly when you slip or trip.",
      "\u201cJust like an athlete needs to do repetition to train for a sport, you\u2019re doing repetition to train for everyday balance activities,\u201d he said.",

      "It was a week of fire and ice.",
      "It began with millions of people across the U.S. shivering amid blizzard conditions and frigid air that lasted for days, thanks to a jet stream that slips out of its usual path more often these days. Then, catastrophe in California, with wind-whipped flames taking off in a landscape parched by months of drought to become Los Angeles' worst-ever wildfires.",
      "To cap it off, major weather monitoring agencies confirmed 2024 as the hottest year in global history. Even more dire, four of the six agencies said it was the first full year Earth went beyond a warming threshold seen as critical to limiting the worst effects of climate change.",
      "Welcome to one wild week of the climate crisis, scientists say. There will be more.",
      "\u201cFor the average person, this means the changes you\u2019re experiencing \u2014 more extreme weather, rising costs due to climate impacts, threats to food and water security \u2014 aren\u2019t anomalies,\u201d said Victor Gensini, a meteorology professor at Northern Illinois University. \u201cThey\u2019re the new normal unless we take action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last week of weird weather has been alarming,\u201d said Natalie Mahowald, chair of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not a sign of things to come, because we\u2019ve barely seen any climate change compared to what we are going to get unless we radically cut CO2 emissions.\u201d",
      "Here's how the week unfolded.",
      "The cold came first.",
      "The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world, which means the difference between temperatures up north and down south are shrinking \u2014 along with sea ice that releases more heat into atmosphere. That means more energy bouncing off and warping or moving the polar vortex, scientists say. And climate change is also messing with the jet stream, the air currents that circle the globe.",
      "The result? More frequent blasts of intense cold in winter even as global temperatures heat up overall.",
      "The blizzard dumped more snow in some parts of Kansas than they usually get in a year, one Kansas State University meteorologist said. Ice-coated trees downed power lines in eastern Kentucky, and a U.S. Olympian skied on the National Mall in Washington.",
      "Farmers rushed to move cows to keep them from freezing to death and to feed and water them as rural roads became impassable. Travel stalled as multiple states warned motorists not to chance the treacherous snow and ice.",
      "About 200 people, many homeless, sheltered at a roller rink in Cincinnati. The alternative was frostbite or worse in exposure to temperatures that were expected to slip from freezing to sub-freezing overnight.",
      "Out West, wildfire took hold.",
      "The Palisades Fire erupted in the Santa Monica mountains and moved quickly on Santa Ana winds gusting to 100 mph \u2014 much faster than normal. The winds were so strong they grounded airplanes normally used to drop water on the flames.",
      "The blaze reached near the Getty Museum and by the end of the day, several celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Mandy Moore and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, had lost homes. Less than 72 hours before, many stars had convened to walk the Golden Globes\u2019 red carpet.",
      "The Eaton Fire tore through Altadena, killing 2 people and closing about 10 school districts.",
      "Climate change laid the groundwork for California\u2019s megafires. Atmospheric rivers dumped huge amounts of water on the region that caused plenty of plant growth. Then, a fast onset of drought dried them out, providing plenty of fodder for the flames.",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled in the morning, as some hydrants ran dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades. At least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The Sunset Fire started, too, threatening the Hollywood Hills and forcing mandatory evacuations in Hollywood.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump criticized state and local officials' water management policies. But experts said critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis.",
      "By the afternoon, calmer winds aided firefighters in making some headway, though by that point at least five fires were still active and some burned out of control in the L.A. area.",
      "Scenes of the destruction started to emerge. Recovery crews pulled a body from the rubble of a beachfront residence in Malibu.",
      "AccuWeather, a private company that provides data on weather and its impact, estimated the overall wildfire damage could reach $57 billion, though much of the destruction remains to be surveyed.",
      "At the same time, another winter storm bore down on the South, with warnings and advisories for at least 20 states. Many had gone through the same thing just days earlier.",
      "Major weather monitoring agencies said 2024 was the hottest since record-keeping began, easily passing 2023.",
      "Even more significant: 2024 was the first year with a global average that broke the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s that was set as a goal by the 2015 Paris climate agreement.",
      "Extreme weather like this week's is \u201caffecting so many more people all at one time,\u201d said Barbara Hofer, a professor emerita of psychology at Middlebury College. \u201cIncreasingly, the scale is changing. The loss is mounting.\"",
      "Hofer said the growing impact may make some people deny climate change, ignore it or become numb to it as \u201ca way to avoid what's psychologically uncomfortable.\"",
      "Such a week can also energize positive change, she said. But Hofer said she thinks that will be harder, at least in the U.S., as Trump takes office. He's promised to halt federal climate action and repeal existing legislation aimed at the problem.",

      "A California man says his two cats died and a third was hospitalized after he fed them raw milk recalled for bird flu risk",
      "A California man whose two cats died after drinking raw milk recalled for bird flu risk says he meant to keep his beloved pets healthy, but his efforts tragically backfired.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible when you realize that you\u2019re the one that actually gave them the milk that killed them,\u201d said Joseph Journell, 56, of San Bernardino.",
      "Journell lost his 14-year-old tabby, Alexander, and Tuxsie, a 4-year-old tuxedo cat, in late November. A third cat, 4-year-old Big Boy, was hospitalized for a week before tests showed the animal was infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus.",
      "The cats drank unpasteurized milk from lots recalled by Raw Farm, of Fresno, whose dairy products were pulled from California store shelves in December after health officials found the virus in milk for sale, he said. The animals' deaths were confirmed by state and county health officials. The cats were kept indoors, with no access to potentially infected birds, and ate conventional, not raw, pet food, the owner said.",
      "Journell said he had been drinking Raw Farm milk himself for several months because he heard it had \u201cbetter immunity and healing properties\u201d than pasteurized milk. He thought it might be able to help Alexander, who had been losing weight.",
      "\u201cI was trying to make him healthier and make him live longer,\u201d Journell said.",
      "Instead, Alexander died on Thanksgiving Day. Tuxsie followed two days later.",
      "Big Boy was hospitalized and treated with antiviral medications, Journell said. The veterinary team collected urine samples from the cat, which were confirmed positive for H5N1 at labs run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and Cornell University, records show.",
      "Big Boy returned home blind and without the use of his back legs, though he is recovering, Journell said. A fourth cat, Cleo, didn\u2019t drink the milk and remained healthy.",
      "Journell has demanded that Raw Farm owner Mark McAfee compensate him for the more than $12,000 he spent treating the cats, according Seattle food safety lawyer Ilana Korchia, who is representing him.",
      "In an interview, McAfee disputed that the virus was capable of sickening the animals days after it was bottled and sold, citing preliminary research.",
      "But Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, said flu virus survival likely varies widely in different lots of milk. Experts with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously confirmed that cats that drank raw milk from infected cows developed neurological disease and died.",
      "\u201cI think the poor cats are the best indicator!\u201d Webby wrote in an email.",
      "Nearly a dozen cats in California have died since early December after consuming raw milk or raw pet food contaminated with bird flu, health officials have said.",
      "The infections have followed a massive outbreak of the bird flu virus in dairy cows, which has affected in more than 900 U.S. dairy herds in 16 states. About 80% of those herds are in California.",
      "Federal and state health officials have warned people not to drink raw milk because of the potential for infection with bird flu and a host of other germs. Officials also have cautioned pet owners to avoid feeding unpasteurized milk and raw meat diets to their animals.",
      "\u201cCats should not be fed any products from affected farms if those products have not been thoroughly cooked or pasteurized to kill the virus,\u201d the FDA warned last month.",
      "After the cats got sick, Journell said he fell ill himself and sought care at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fontana, Calif. He said he wasn't checked for bird flu, despite his known exposure to the virus, because medical staff didn't have tests available to detect it.",
      "A Kaiser spokesperson declined to comment on Journell's case specifically, but said the hospital system is following CDC guidelines for screening for bird flu.",
      "Journell has recovered physically but said he's still suffering from the \u201cmental anguish\" of losing his pets. Despite the ordeal, he said he still thinks raw milk offers some health benefits.",
      "Nevertheless, he won't be drinking it any time soon.",

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is suing the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, hoping it will lead to a cleanup of the urban waterway",
      "The District of Columbia on Friday filed a lawsuit against the federal government over pollution in the Anacostia River, arguing it has inflicted \u201ccatastrophic harm\u201d on the mostly poor and minority communities living along the urban waterway.",
      "The lawsuit argues that federal government, which owns and controls the riverbed, has since the 1800s dumped toxic waste, heavy metals and chemicals including carcinogenic PCBs in the river and refused to clean it up. The 9-mile (14-kilometer) river flows through Washington, D.C. and parts of Maryland. For decades, it was treated as a municipal dumping ground for industrial waste, storm sewers and trash. That contamination largely affected communities of color.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that PCBs from the Washington Navy Yard were dumped in the river along with hazardous chemicals from the Kenilworth Landfill and chemical waste from federal printing facilities. It also blamed the federal government for poorly managing the District of Columbia's sewer system, which led to the dumping of raw sewage and toxic waste into the river.",
      "That pollution has led to swimming bans and warnings about fishing along the river, the lawsuit alleges, calling the federal government its biggest polluter.",
      "\u201cIt has systematically contaminated the River through the indiscriminate dumping and release of hazardous substances and through destructive dredge and fill operations,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said pollutants in the river don't break down and cause long-lasting harm to the environment, aquatic wildlife, and human health, including cancer, neurological and developmental disorders and birth defects.",
      "The District of Columbia is demanding that the federal government pay for the river's cleanup.",
      "The lawsuit comes as the District of Columbia has made progress in cleaning up the river and returning to a time where residents fished and boated and wildlife including bald eagles, osprey, cranes, kingfishers and eel thrived there.",
      "A $3.29 billion sewer upgrade, including a series of tunnels drilled under the city to capture storm and sewage water, has reduced overflows into the river by 91%, according to DC Water, the city\u2019s water utility. The final section of the Anacostia Tunnel System went online in 2023, and the overall system is expected to reduce overflows by 98%.",
      "Pepco, the city\u2019s utility, also reached an agreement with the District of Columbia to pay more than $57 million for discharging hazardous chemicals from their power plants into soil, groundwater and storm sewers for decades that polluted the Anacostia and other areas. The settlement was believed to be the largest in the utility\u2019s history.",
      "The payments will be used in part to clean up the river. Other measures the city government instituted like a fee on plastic bags since 2009 have also helped keep trash out, experts say.",
      "Still, the Anacostia remains polluted. It received a failing grade for the third time in six years in 2023 from a nonprofit that grades the river\u2019s health based on its fecal bacteria content and the state of its aquatic vegetation.",

      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- The United Nations human rights chief on Wednesday called for the lifting of Western sanctions imposed on Syria over its yearslong civil war, now that former leader Bashar Assad has been ousted and sent into exile.",
      "While visiting Syria, Volker T\u00fcrk also urged transitional justice for victims, saying it enhances public trust in state institutions as the county moves ahead under its de facto new leaders.",
      "\u201cRevenge and vengeance are never the answer,\u201d T\u00fcrk said, a month after the Assad family's decadeslong dynasty ended when insurgent groups captured Damascus.",
      "T\u00fcrk said he met with Ahmad al-Sharaa, who leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group leading the new authority in Syria. He said al-Sharaa assured him of the importance of respecting human rights for all Syrians, and said authorities will work on social cohesion and institutional reform.",
      "Syria\u2019s conflict broke out in early 2011 and left nearly half a million people dead and millions displaced, including many who are now refugees. The war caused wide destruction that will need tens of billions of dollars to rebuild.",
      "\u201cThe people of Syria need every ounce of help they can get to rebuild a country that works for all Syrians,\u201d T\u00fcrk said. He added that there are still threats to Syria\u2019s territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty which must be fully respected.",
      "\u201cThe ongoing conflicts and hostilities must end,\u201d he said.",
      "European countries and the United States imposed sanctions on Assad\u2019s government shortly after the conflict started. They have been wary over the Islamist roots of the former insurgents who now lead an interim government.",
      "\u201cIt will be critical to bear in mind the impact sanctions have on the lives of the Syrian people,\u201d T\u00fcrk said. \u201cI therefore call for an urgent reconsideration of sectoral sanctions with a view to lifting them.\u201d",
      "Also Wednesday, a Syrian Interior Ministry official said authorities have detained an Egyptian militant who recently released videos vowing to work on overthrowing the government in Egypt.",
      "Ahmad al-Mansour has been living in Syria for years and was among the fighters that toppled Assad's government.",
      "The ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said al-Mansour was detained late Tuesday.",
      "Al-Mansour\u2019s arrest is likely to ease concerns in some Arab countries, including Egypt, that Syria will not be used as a base to plot against regional nations."

      "Officials now say they are closer than ever to reaching an agreement to pause the Israel-Hamas war and release hostages held in the Gaza Strip",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- With a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas tantalizingly close, families of hostages in the Gaza Strip are afraid to get their hopes up and agonizing over the unknown.",
      "\u201cThese days are horrible for us,\u201d Yafit Zailer said Wednesday, breaking down into sobs over the thought of her relatives \u2014 Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their two small children, Ariel and Kfir \u2014 being released after 15 months of captivity.",
      "\u201cI want to know already if they\u2019re coming back,\" Zailer said. \"I want to know already if they\u2019re OK or not. I want to hold my cousin in my arms and celebrate the biggest celebration.\u201d",
      "The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent the past year trying to mediate an end to the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack into Israel and the release of dozens of hostages captured that day. Officials now say they are closer than ever to announcing an agreement.",
      "Even if a deal is reached, the torment experienced by families of the hostages and war-weary Palestinians in Gaza could be far from over.",
      "Families of the hostages do not know whether their loved ones are alive or dead, and many will have to wait for a subsequent phase of the agreement that has yet to be negotiated.",
      "In war-ravaged Gaza, many displaced Palestinians do not know if their homes are still standing, thousands are still buried under rubble and dozens are missing after encounters with Israeli forces. Vast areas appear uninhabitable, and it could take decades to rebuild.",
      "If talks over the second \u2014 and more difficult \u2014 phase of the emerging ceasefire deal break down, the war could resume, bringing even more death, destruction and displacement to Gaza and an even longer wait for families of the hostages.",
      "Shiri and Yarden Bibas and their two red-haired sons, 5-year-old Ariel and Kfir \u2014 who will turn 2 on Saturday \u2014 were among the roughly 250 hostages dragged into Gaza in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war, in which some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed.",
      "Kfir, who was then 9 months old, was the youngest to be taken captive. The infant with red hair and a toothless smile, who has been in captivity for almost two thirds of his life, has become a symbol across Israel for the helplessness and anger over the hostages\u2019 plight.",
      "Shiri, Ariel and Kfir were supposed to be released with other women and children during a ceasefire in November 2023, but it fell apart after a week. All four members of the family were on a list obtained by The Associated Press that named 33 hostages who could be released in the initial six-week phase of the draft agreement.",
      "\u201cI want to tell all the parties involved in the negotiations, it\u2019s time to end this,\" Zailer said, tears streaming down her face. \u201cIt\u2019s time to bring home our people, it\u2019s time to end this war.\u201d",
      "Daniel Lifshitz' 84-year-old grandfather, Oded, is being held captive in Gaza along with many of his friends. His grandmother was released shortly after the initial attack.",
      "As he waits for news, Lifshitz scrolls through his phone looking for updates and reaches out to the hostage negotiators for positive signs. The less they respond, the more optimistic things look, he said of his experience with them. But even the announcement of a deal would provide only some relief.",
      "\u201cAnother roller coaster is coming \u2014 is he alive or not? Should I prepare (for) a funeral or should I prepare (for) a celebration?\u201d said Lifshitz. It's something his family doesn't want to discuss.",
      "Some 100 hostages remain captive inside Gaza, a mix of civilians and soldiers, as well as around a dozen foreign nationals from Thailand, Nepal and Tanzania. The military believes at least a third of the remaining hostages \u2014 and up to half of them \u2014 are dead.",
      "The three-phased agreement would begin with the release of 33 women, children, older adults and wounded civilians in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian women and children imprisoned by Israel. Soldiers and other male captives would be released in the second phase.",
      "Herut Nimrodi's son, Tamir, was abducted from his army base on Oct. 7. The now 20-year-old soldier won't be included in the deal's first phase, and she worries that if the ceasefire doesn't hold, pressure to release the remaining hostages will decline because there will be fewer of them.",
      "Hamas says it will not release the remaining hostages without an end to the war, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu has vowed to continue the offensive until Hamas' military and governing abilities are destroyed.",
      "If no agreement is reached on the second phase, the war could resume this spring.",
      "For hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians living in squalid tent camps and fearing Israeli airstrikes, the end of the war cannot come soon enough. Previous breakdowns in the talks have been followed by renewed Israeli offensives.",
      "\u201cThe best thing right now, immediately, without any delay, would be to stop everything and announce a truce,\" said Sulaiman Qasem, a coordinator with a medical charity in Gaza City. \u201cLast night the shelling and bombing here didn\u2019t stop for a moment ... It's absolute madness.\"",
      "The war has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians, but says women and children make up more than half the fatalities. Israel\u2019s offensive has reduced large areas of the strip to rubble and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million, leaving many at risk of famine.",
      "Rola Saqer's daughter was born on the first day of the war, and nearly every day since has been a struggle to find safety, food and health care.",
      "The family fled their apartment and was forced to live in a cramped tent with other relatives. Saqer said her daughter, Massa Zaqout, has difficulty walking and worries the lack of proper nutrients will affect her development.",
      "The proposed ceasefire deal includes a surge of humanitarian aid, and would allow Palestinians to start returning to their homes, assuming they still exist.",
      "\u201cWe have no strength left,\u00a8 said Rami Abu Shera, who was displaced from his home in Khan Younis. \u201cWe are waiting for there to be no blood, no killings, no wounded, no destruction, no displacement. It is enough,\u201d he said.",

      "Rescuers and volunteers have pulled at least 78 dead miners and more than 160 survivors from an abandoned South African gold mine",
      "STILFONTEIN, South Africa -- Rescuers and volunteers have pulled at least 78 dead miners and more than 160 survivors from an abandoned South African gold mine, where they have languished for over two months during a standoff with authorities who demanded they surrender to police because they were mining illegally.",
      "Hundreds are still believed to be trapped Wednesday and the death toll is expected to rise in a disaster that has focused criticism on the South African government\u2019s decision to try to \u201csmoke them out\u201d by cutting off food and other supplies for a time. Civic groups claim authorities also removed the ropes and pulley systems that the miners used to enter and exit at least one shaft and send down supplies.",
      "The groups say the government's weekslong refusal to stage a rescue effectively left scores of miners to die of starvation or dehydration. A rescue is now underway \u2014 after a court order \u2014 but only a few miners can be pulled up at a time, and the operation could take 10 days.",
      "South African authorities have argued that the miners were always able to exit through another shaft at Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, one of the deepest in the mineral-rich country.",
      "But activists said that would involve a dangerous trek underground that could take days for some, and many became too weak or ill after months underground with little food and water. Police contend some miners refused to come out.",
      "In response to a request by a relative of one of the miners, a court last week ordered a rescue operation, which began Monday. A specialist mining rescue company has been dropping a small cage thousands of meters (feet) into the mine to retrieve survivors and bodies. But no personnel from the company entered the shaft because they consider it too dangerous \u2014 instead community volunteers headed down in the cage to help the miners out.",
      "Police first tried to force the miners out of the closed mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, in November by cutting off their supplies. The move, part of a larger crackdown on illegal mining, began a standoff between authorities and the miners and members of the community.",
      "A court ruled that authorities had to allow supplies in \u2014 but civic groups argue that officials needed to do more at that point because even without police interference the miners weren't able to get enough food and water into the mine and the situation was becoming dire.",
      "The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. A group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine and estimated that more than 500 miners were underground when the rescue started.",
      "It's unclear exactly how long they've been underground, but relatives say some of them have been there since July.",
      "Police said Wednesday that 78 bodies have been recovered so far, and 166 survivors brought out since the official rescue operation began. A community group says another nine bodies were recovered on Friday and an unconfirmed number in the previous weeks after members of the community attempted to rescue miners themselves.",
      "Civic groups representing the miners say at least 100 have died.",
      "The official rescue is now proceeding slowly because only a few people can fit in the cage at a time and because the shaft is so deep.",
      "Authorities have argued that the miners could have exited if they wanted to \u2014 and police say more than 1,000 did before the rescue operation \u2014 but they didn't because they feared arrest. Police say they have arrested everyone who has surfaced both before and after the rescue operation.",
      "They will face charges of illegal mining and trespassing. Authorities seized gold, explosives, firearms and more than $2 million in cash from the miners.",
      "One of the civic groups representing the miners released two videos over the weekend showing what it said were the dire conditions underground. The videos were on a cellphone carried out of the mine by one of the miners, the group said, along with a note urging people to watch them.",
      "In them, dozens of what appear to be dead bodies can be seen lined up in a darkened cavern and wrapped in plastic. They also show shirtless, emaciated-looking miners while the man filming says they are dying and begs for authorities to send them food and get them out.",
      "Authorities are particularly under fire for their tactics last year, when they cut off food and other supplies to the miners underground for a period of time. It was an attempt to \u201csmoke them out,\u201d a South African Cabinet minister said, adding that authorities would not help the miners because they were \u201ccriminals.\u201d",
      "Rights groups have condemned the plan, accusing authorities of contributing to a \u201cmassacre\u201d at the mine, and members of the community have also gathered at the mine holding placards criticizing the authorities.",
      "But while anger is high in the local community, the tragedy has not stoked a strong reaction across South Africa, where illegal mining is often in the news.",
      "The practice is common at mines that companies have closed because they are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter in a search for leftover deposits. South Africa has an estimated 6,000 abandoned mines.",
      "The South African government has taken a hard-line approach to the groups, who are known as zama zamas \u2014 which means \u201chustlers\u201d in the Zulu language \u2014 and have long been a problem for authorities. They are often armed and part of criminal syndicates, the government says, and many are foreigners who entered South Africa illegally from neighboring countries.",
      "The government says they are robbing South Africa of more than $1 billion a year in gold.",
      "Authorities said that more than 1,500 people have been arrested for mining illegally in the Stilfontein area over the last year, with the vast majority of them from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho.",

      "Israel supplied Iran with centrifuge platforms containing explosives for its nuclear enrichment program in an act of sabotage",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Israel supplied Iran with centrifuge platforms containing explosives for its nuclear enrichment program, a top Iranian official has acknowledged for the first time, underscoring the sophistication of sabotage programs targeting the Islamic Republic.",
      "The comments by Mohammad Javad Zarif, a former foreign minister who serves as vice president for strategic affairs for reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, appear aimed at explaining to the country\u2019s disaffected public the challenges Iran's government faces under crushing Western sanctions over the program. The comments also acknowledged details previously reported in Israel about a 2021 attack on Iran's underground Natanz nuclear enrichment facility.",
      "The revelation, released this week, shows the danger still facing Iran after Israel struck the country twice during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip \u2014 and threatens to directly target its nuclear sites as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to re-enter the White House next week.",
      "Zarif made the remarks in an interview with a program affiliated with the Institute for the Compilation and Publication of Imam Khomeini\u2019s Works, a publicly funded organization in Iran. Politicians from Iran's reformist camp, which seeks to change Iran's Shiite theocracy from within, often seek different media outlets to reach the public as Iranian state television is controlled by hard-liners.",
      "Zarif, who helped Iran reach its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, discussed a sabotage attack launched by Israel's Mossad intelligence agency targeting pagers and radios used by the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah in September. The two waves of attacks killed 42 people and wounded thousands more, setting the stage for Israel's invasion of Lebanon in October.",
      "\u201cThis is part of the damage of sanctions, that you are forced to receive (purchases) through multiple dealers instead of buying from a factory directly,\" Zarif said. \"If the Zionist regime can infiltrate one of the dealers, then it can do anything and install anything.\u201d",
      "He added: \"For instance, our friends at the Atomic Energy Organization (of Iran) had purchased a platform for centrifuges in which (the Israelis) had installed explosive material.\u201d",
      "Zarif did not elaborate, and the interviewer did not press him on the issue.",
      "However, it marked the first clear acknowledgment of the degree Mossad had infiltrated Iran's program.",
      "In July 2020, a mysterious explosion tore apart Natanz\u2019s advanced centrifuge assembly, which Iran blamed on Israel. In April 2021, another blast tore apart one of its underground enrichment halls.",
      "A few months later, Israel's outgoing Mossad chief Yossi Cohen gave an interview to Israeli television in which he all but acknowledged his spies executed the two attacks. The show said a saboteur \u201cmade sure to supply to the Iranians the marble foundation on which the centrifuges are placed\" that included \"an enormous amount of explosives.\u201d",
      "The attacks happened under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has led Israel through the Mideast wars since Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Since then, Israel's war targeting Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to health authorities there.",
      "As mediators say Israel and Hamas are the closest they've been to a ceasefire, concerns have grown over Iran's nuclear program. Since Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from an international accord greatly restricting Iran's program, Tehran has broken through all limits of the deal.",
      "Iran now enriches uranium closer than ever to weapons-grade levels and has a growing stockpile of enriched uranium. Its officials increasingly threaten to seek an atomic bomb.",
      "Iranian officials insist their nuclear program is peaceful and they want to negotiate with the West over it.",
      "\u201cThe problem we have is not in dialogue,\u201d Pezeshkian told NBC News in an interview aired Tuesday night. \u201cIt\u2019s in the commitments that arise from talk and dialogue that we\u2019ll have to commit to.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cWe upheld all the commitments that we had to commit to. But unfortunately it was the other party that did not live up to its promises and obligations.\u201d",
      "Israel, President Joe Biden and Trump have repeatedly warned they will not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. That's raised fears of a preemptive Israeli strike targeting Iranian nuclear sites, something Israel has done in both Iraq and Syria.",
      "Asked about the possibility of such a strike, Pezeshkian said: \u201cWe do not fear war, but we don't seek it.\"",

      "LONDON -- Britain\u2019s new government, which is already facing anger over higher taxes, unpopular spending decisions and political scandals just six months after taking office, is now being battered by rising borrowing costs that threaten to derail its left-leaning program.",
      "The yield on the U.K.\u2019s 10-year bonds, a reflection of the price investors demand for financing the country\u2019s debt, has risen by more than 1.1 percentage points since Sept. 16 on concerns over sluggish economic growth and stubbornly high inflation. That has pushed Britain\u2019s borrowing costs to the highest level since the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "As borrowing costs rise, the government has less money to spend on the country\u2019s creaking National Health Service, military, emergency services and schools. Though officials got a brief respite when the rate of inflation dropped slightly in December, if things don\u2019t turn around quickly Prime Minister Keir Starmer may have to rethink promises to boost spending and avoid tax increases on \u201cworking people\u201d that helped his Labour Party win a landslide election victory in July.",
      "The problems are partly due to the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose pledge to increases taxes on imported goods has sent shivers through the world economy and boosted global bond yields. But the problem is partly of the government\u2019s own making, as Treasury chief Rachel Reeves built her economic plan on the assumption that economic growth would boost tax revenue.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at Britain's economy and the possible implications.",
      "Bond investors around the world have been spooked by concerns over Trump\u2019s plan to impose high tariffs on imported goods will push up U.S. consumer prices, prompting the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer, said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at the U.K. investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown. Higher prices tend to lead to higher borrowing costs as bondholders seek to ensure that their investment isn\u2019t eroded by inflation.",
      "Only a few months ago, investors were betting the Fed would approve multiple rate cuts this year. Now they\u2019re anticipating just one.",
      "\u201cThe rise in gilt yields since the early autumn appears to largely be the result of global factors, rather than any decision the U.K. government has taken in recent weeks or months, and appears to largely reflect market expectations for higher central bank interest rates in the years ahead,\u201d the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a think tank that focuses on U.K. government policies, said last week.",
      "Gilts are a type of bond issued by the U.K. government that are traded on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "No, borrowing costs are rising in many countries, including the U.S.",
      "But Britain is particularly exposed because of the state of its economy and high levels of government debt.",
      "Consumer price inflation dipped to 2.5% in the 12 months through December, from 2.6% the previous month. That's still some ways away from the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target.",
      "The British economy has basically flatlined in recent months. The latest government statistics showed that gross domestic product was stagnant in the three months through September, after growing 0.7% in the first quarter and 0.4% in the second.",
      "That\u2019s partly due to the government\u2019s decision to boost payroll taxes paid by employers and increase workplace regulation, causing some companies to curtail investment and hiring.",
      "\u201cThe U.K. is also now in the eye of the storm,\u2019\u2019 Streeter said, adding that \u201cstagflation fears are taking hold.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith concerns that there\u2019s a stagnating economy, inflation has veered away from the Bank of England\u2019s target. And that\u2019s also made investors nervous about holding U.K. government debt,\u201d she said.",
      "U.K. government debt stood at more than 98% of economic output in November. That's the highest level since 1963, when Britain was still paying down its debts from World War II.",
      "Reeves was counting on economic growth to help reduce debt as a percentage of GDP. She also introduced new fiscal rules that will bar the government from borrowing to fund day-to-day spending by 2030, while pledging not to raise taxes on \u201cworking people.\u201d",
      "Higher borrowing costs will make meeting those goals more difficult. Even so, it would be difficult for Reeves to abandon her promises, said Paul Johnson, the institute\u2019s director.",
      "\u2033She\u2019s really nailed her colors to the mast there and we\u2019ve seen that the markets are pretty concerned about the U.K position,\u2019\u2019 Johnson told the BBC last weekend. \u201cThat's partly because we are so dependent on international flows of finance to finance our debt and indeed to finance things like our trade deficit with countries like China.\u2019\u2019",
      "All this means the new Labour government has had to take risks, such as reaching out to China to boost trade and business ties despite critics raising national security concerns.",
      "Reeves recently made a three-day trip to China, seeking investment rather than staying home and trying to calm the markets. While some derided the trip, Reeves insisted that China offered Britain an opportunity to drive growth that it cannot ignore.",
      "\u201cChoosing not to engage with China is therefore no choice at all,\u2019\u2019 she wrote in the Times of London.",
      "Reeves may run out of options if borrowing costs stay high, curtailing the amount of money she has to spend.",
      "A policy shift could come as early as March 26, when Reeves is due to update Parliament on the country\u2019s financial position and the Office for Budget Responsibility will update its economic and fiscal forecasts.",
      "\u201cUltimately, investors shouldn\u2019t panic,\u2019\u2019 Streeter said. \u201cFinancial markets can be wracked with volatility, but over the longer term, that does tend to even out.\u201d"

      "The latest misfire was on Saturday when the Nigerian air force bombarded rebels in the conflict-battered northwestern Zamfara State but ended up erroneously killing civilians working with a community security outfit, the state government said. Residents told the Associated Press that at least 20 civilians were killed.",

      "Nigeria's Defense Chief Gen. Christopher Musa has said the military has been improving its human rights record and is holding its personnel to account.",
      "Besides the Boko Haram Islamic extremist group which launched an insurgency in 2009 to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, in the northeast, there have been dozens of armed groups.",
      "They are mostly former herdsmen caught up in decadeslong conflict with farming communities over access to land and water. Once armed with sticks, the groups now carry out attacks with guns that have been smuggled into the country, resulting in roughly thousands of deaths yearly.",
      "The armed groups carry out mass killings and kidnappings for ransom in the northwest and central regions. They also extort taxes from the communities they terrorize, using the funds to support their operations in addition to the money gotten from ransom payments, analysts said.",
      "These armed groups operate in vast forest enclaves, planning and launching attacks that sometimes last for days in villages with inadequate security presence. They rarely remain in one location for long, frequently relocating and blending in with local communities to evade detection.",
      "As a result, the Nigerian military often relies on airstrikes to target the rebels as they move around and in their hideouts, especially in areas where ground assaults are difficult.",
      "Authorities say it can be challenging to avoid civilian casualties in air raids because armed groups often use civilians as human shields.",
      "\u201cBandits and terrorists, unlike professional soldiers, don\u2019t respect the rules of engagement. They don\u2019t care about killing their hostages if they come under attack,\u201d Nigeria\u2019s former President Muhammadu Buhari once said.",
      "However, the frequent mistakes resulting in civilian deaths can be also attributed to loopholes in intelligence gathering as well as insufficient coordination between ground troops, air assets, and stakeholders, said Senator Iroegbu, an Abuja-based security analyst.",
      "The Nigerian government and military often promise to investigate the accidental airstrikes to prevent a reoccurrence. Analysts, however, say the problem has persisted and such investigations often don't lead to anything.",
      "In 2024, the Nigerian military took a rare measure to prosecute two of its personnel over an accidental airstrike that killed over 80 civilians in Kaduna State. It also promised to release the report of its investigation into the incident but has not done so.",
      "One key step is improved investment in pilot training and aircrew development as well as upgrading aircraft and targeting systems,\" said Oluwole Ojewale with the Africa-focused Institute for Security Studies.",
      "The military needs to also build trust and secure the support of local communities, whose intelligence on armed group movements is crucial to accurately target and defeat them, he said."

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was visiting Poland on Wednesday after the two countries reached an agreement on a longstanding source of tensions between them: the exhumation of Polish victims of World War II-era massacres by Ukrainian nationalists.",
      "The office of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said early Wednesday he would welcome Zelenskyy in the late morning, and that the two would hold a joint news conference shortly after noon local time.",
      "The visit comes just days after Tusk announced progress on the issue of the exhumations, an issue that has strained relations for years.",
      "\u201cFinally a breakthrough. There is a decision on the first exhumations of Polish victims of the UPA,\" Tusk wrote on the social platform X on Friday, referring to the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. \u201cI thank the ministers of culture of Poland and Ukraine for their good cooperation. We are waiting for further decisions.\u201d",
      "A non-governmental group, the Freedom and Democracy Foundation, said Monday it will begin exhumation work on victims in Ukraine in April.",
      "Although Poland has been one of Ukraine's most stalwart supporters since Russia's full-scale invasion nearly three years ago, the issue of the Polish victims lying in mass graves in Ukrainian soil eight decades after they were killed has left a festering bitterness among many Poles.",
      "It also has put pressure on Tusk, who is seeking to show progress on an issue of continued importance to many people in Poland. It is particularly important as his party's candidate in a presidential election in May is expected to face a strong challenge from a nationalist opposition candidate.",
      "The issue dates back to 1943-44, when Europe was at war. Ukrainian nationalists massacred about 100,000 Poles in Volhynia and other regions that were then in eastern Poland, under Nazi German occupation, and which are now part of Ukraine.",
      "Entire villages were burned down and their inhabitants killed by the nationalists and their helpers who were seeking to establish an independent Ukraine state. Poland considers the events a genocide and has been asking Ukraine to let them exhume the victims to give them proper burials.",
      "An estimated 15,000 Ukrainians were killed in retaliation.",
      "The issue is difficult for Ukraine because some of the World War II-era Ukrainian nationalists are regarded as national heroes due to their struggle for Ukraine's statehood.",
      "As the two sides moved to resolve the issue, the chairman of Ukraine\u2019s parliament in May 2023 offered words of reconciliation in the Polish parliament.",
      "\u201cHuman life has equal value, regardless of nationality, race, sex or religion,\u201d Ruslan Stefanchuk told Polish lawmakers at the time. \u201cWith this awareness we will cooperate with you, dear Polish friends, and we will accept the truth regardless of how uncompromising it may be.\u201d",

      "The Transportation Department is stepping up enforcement of persistent flight delays with a lawsuit against Southwest Airlines and a fine against Frontier Airlines.",
      "The agency said the U.S. District Court lawsuit it filed in California on Wednesday alleges that Southwest illegally operated chronically delayed flights and disrupted passengers' travel plans. It says it's seeking \u201cmaximum civil penalties.\u201d",
      "\u201cAirlines have a legal obligation to ensure that their flight schedules provide travelers with realistic departure and arrival times,\" Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s action sends a message to all airlines that the Department is prepared to go to court in order to enforce passenger protections.\u201d",
      "The Transportation Department said its investigation found that Dallas-based Southwest operated two chronically delayed flights \u2013 one between Chicago Midway International Airport and Oakland, California, and another between Baltimore, Maryland and Cleveland, Ohio.",
      "Both flights were chronically delayed for five straight months and together resulted in 180 flight disruptions for passengers between April and August 2022, the agency said.",
      "The department fined Frontier Airlines $650,000 in civil penalties with $325,000 to be paid to the U.S. Treasury and the remaining $325,000 to be suspended if the carrier does not operate any chronically delayed flights in the next three years.",
      "The announcement comes less than two weeks after the Transportation Department fined JetBlue $2 million for chronic delays, the first time it imposed a penalty for lateness on specific routes. The agency cited JetBlue's chronic delays on \u201cunrealistic scheduling.\u201d JetBlue then said the government, which operates the air traffic control system, shares the blame for late flights.",
      "Aviation-data provider Cirium said in a report released this month that Southwest ranked fifth among the 10 North American airlines it evaluated for their on-time performance, with 77.8% of arrivals and a little under 77% of departures last year taking place in a timely way. By comparison, top-ranked Delta Air Lines scored 83.5% for arrivals and 83.7% for departures.",
      "Last year, federal regulators increased their scrutiny of Southwest Airlines after a series of incidents, including flying at very low altitudes while still miles away from an airport. The Federal Aviation Administration said in July it wanted to ensure the carrier was complying with federal safety regulations.

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "JPMorgan\u2019s net income soared 50% to more than $14 billion in the fourth quarter as the bank\u2019s profit and revenue easily beat Wall Street forecasts, and other major banks reported banner earnings for the year",
      "JPMorgan\u2019s net income soared 50% to more than $14 billion in the fourth quarter as the bank\u2019s profit and revenue easily beat Wall Street forecasts, and other major banks reported banner earnings for the year.",
      "Earnings per share rose to $4.81 from $3.04 a year ago. The result beat Wall Street profit projections of $4.09 a share, according to the data firm FactSet. Total managed revenue hit $43.7 billion, up 10%, from $39.9 billion a year ago. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $41.9 billion.",
      "JPMorgan posted a record $54 billion profit for the year, or $18.22 per share, adjusted for one-time expenses.",
      "Yet interest income fell 3% to $23.5 billion, driven lower by lower interest rates.",
      "JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank got a boost from investment banking business, where fees rose 49% and markets revenue jumped 21%.",
      "The bank\u2019s consumer banking business also thrived, with clients opening nearly 2 million checking accounts.",
      "The New York bank set aside $2.6 billion to cover bad loans, down slightly from the same period a year ago.",
      "JPMorgan shares rose 1.2% before the bell.",
      "Wells Fargo also topped profit expectations Wednesday with a nearly 50% jump in net income, with earnings of $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.43 per share. Revenue came in at $20.4 billion, a touch lower than expectations. In the same quarter a year ago, Wells posted net income of $3.4 billion, or 86 cents per share, on $20.5 billion in revenue.",
      "In September, Wells Fargo agreed to work with U.S. bank regulators to shore up its financial crimes risk management, including internal controls related to suspicious activity and money laundering. The agreement came just seven months after the Biden Administration lifted a consent order on the bank that had been in place since 2016 following a series of scandals, including the opening of fake customer accounts.",
      "Wells rose 3.2% before markets opened.",
      "JPMorgan's Dimon said the U.S. economy remains strong, noting the nation's low unemployment and strong consumer spending.",
      "\u201cBusinesses are more optimistic about the economy, and they are encouraged by expectations for a more pro-growth agenda and improved collaboration between government and business,\u201d said, alluding the an incoming Trump administration that has promised to cut regulations across industries.",
      "Dimon said that any regulation should balance promoting growth and keeping the banking system safe. \u201cThis is not about weakening regulation ... but rather about setting rules that are transparent, fair and holistic in their approach and based on rigorous data analysis, so that banks can play their critical role in the economy and markets.\u201d",
      "Dimon, however, said that the state of the geopolitics \u201cremains the most dangerous and complicated since World War II\u201d and that JPMorgan is preparing for a wide range of outcomes."

      "CES in Las Vegas provides an annual preview of high-tech attractions headed for the car world",
      "CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas continues to provide a sneak peek at future technology. The annual showcase includes advanced automotive tech in an industry striving to reduce pollution and increase occupant safety while also providing greater convenience and entertainment for road warriors. These are the most impressive innovations we saw at this year\u2019s event.",
      "What kind of screens and technology can you expect to see in new vehicles in the coming years? BMW\u2019s all-new in-cabin digital interface, dubbed Panoramic iDrive, gives us a compelling preview.",
      "Panoramic iDrive has a digital display at the base of the windshield spanning the entire dashboard. This display is called Panoramic Vision, and it projects everything from speed to EV range to navigation guidance, along with climate and audio info. This display pairs with an easy-to-reach central touchscreen and advanced head-up display that can project 3D-like information on the windshield for the driver. BMW also showcased a new squared-off steering wheel with illuminated buttons that the company says are very easy to use.",
      "We expect Panoramic iDrive will debut in upcoming BMW vehicles in late 2025.",
      "Honda jumped into the deep end of the electric vehicle pool at CES 2025 with the debut of two all-new, all-electric models. The Honda 0 SUV and 0 Saloon are based on two wild-looking concept cars shown at last year\u2019s CES, yet these production-ready models haven\u2019t lost any of their aggressive style and will definitely turn heads when they arrive in 2026.",
      "Both will be built in Ohio and will be capable of Level 3 automated driving functionality, meaning drivers will be allowed to drive hands-free and take their eyes off the road for short periods of time when specific environmental conditions are met. Honda says these 0 models will also use a new technology interface, called Asimo, that will provide a high degree of personalization to customize the driving experience for each user.",
      "The launch of the 0 SUV and 0 Saloon will coincide with Honda\u2019s effort to improve charging access to drivers through a joint effort with seven other automakers. The goal is to have 30,000 high-speed charging stations built in North America by 2030. These stations will have plugs with the Tesla-style North American Charging Standard, or NACS, which most automakers have been switching to.",
      "Even in 2025, getting consistent and stable internet service can be a challenge. We can access the information superhighway through Wi-Fi networks, cellular service or satellite signals, though all three have limitations and are certainly not 100% reliable.",
      "But what if you could combine the power of satellite, cellular and Wi-Fi networks into a single pipeline of internet service? And what if that pipeline could constantly evaluate and optimize the data stream as you travel between signal sources? That\u2019s exactly what Stellar, a new company from France, is offering. The company is working with automakers to optimize mobile service by using hardware already built into today\u2019s cars. The end goal is to have improved, more consistent high-speed internet access in your vehicle, whether you\u2019re going through a city tunnel or driving across the open plains.",
      "Toyota\u2019s vision for the future of mobility goes beyond EVs and self-driving cars. The company is engineering a complete city environment in Japan where everything from building construction to food supply to education and transportation are coordinated for maximum efficiency and minimal environmental impact. The areas of focus include personal transportation, and the company\u2019s massive site, called Woven City, will serve as a test course for automated tech development.",
      "Woven City will scale from an initial 50,000 square miles up to 700,000 square miles as construction continues. By the fall of 2025, it will provide housing for about 360 Toyota staff and family members and eventually expand to 2,000-plus residents, including Woven City partner companies involved in construction, food and drink, education and even rocket production.",
      "While it\u2019s hard to predict what will come out of Toyota\u2019s Woven City that will actually end up in production vehicles, it\u2019s fair to say that Toyota will have a head start on how to leverage various new technologies best.",
      "Full self-driving cars have yet to appear, but automakers are chipping away at this elusive tech while making clear progress in advanced user interfaces, electric vehicle design, and even comprehensive city planning. While the last few years have seen moderate progress in these areas, it feels like we\u2019re on the cusp of multiple breakthroughs in the automotive space.",

      "Albanian Premier Edi Rama valued the energy deal at around 1 billion euros.",
      "Meloni said the three-way arrangement would help Italy meet its long-term electricity needs while honoring its sustainable energy commitments made at U.N. climate conferences. She praised it as pragmatic way to transition away from fossil fuels at a time when energy needs are soaring due to the demand from AI-generated technologies.",
      "\u201cThe future of energy transition and digitization will thus depend on our ability to strike a balance between sustainability and innovation,\u201d she said, adding that nuclear fusion could be another way to produce clean and safe energy. She acknowledged the unusual nature of the three-way deal, noting the \u201cseemingly distant partners, at least geographically speaking.\u201d",
      "The UAE, a major oil-producing nation, has pledged to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and hosted the COP28 climate summit last year.",

      "BERLIN -- Germany's economy shrank for the second straight year in 2024 as worried consumers held back on spending and Chinese competition ate into the country's traditional exports of cars and industrial machinery.",
      "The year's weak performance underlines Germany's status as Europe's worst performing major economy and shows the country as having no meaningful growth in the past four years as it has struggled to deal with major shifts in the global economy.",
      "Gross domestic product contracted by 0.2% last year, following a 0.3% decline in 2023, according to preliminary official figures released Wednesday, weeks before an election in which the economy is the top issue.",
      "The economy is now only 0.3% bigger than it was in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "German business has been battered by external shocks and homegrown problems, unleashing an angst-ridden national debate over how to remedy the situation. Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s three-party coalition government collapsed in November when Scholz fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize the economy. That paved the way for an early election on Feb. 23.",
      "Contenders to lead the next government have made contrasting proposals on how to inject new vigor into the economy.",
      "Ruth Brand, the head of the statistics office, ticked off the list of short- and long-term challenges: higher energy prices after the loss of cheap natural gas from Russia; high interest rates from the European Central Bank that deter investment in new machinery and vehicles; and consumers worried about the future who are saving their wages instead of spending them.",
      "Spending on hotels and restaurants sagged by 4.4% and outlays for clothing and shoes fell by 2.8% despite rising disposable income.",
      "On top of that comes increasing competition for export markets from China in traditional areas of German strength such as cars, industrial machinery and chemicals.",
      "Other, more chronic issues include excessive bureaucracy and a shortage of skilled labor.",
      "\u201cGerman exports saw themselves exposed to stronger international competition, not least from the People's Republic of China,\u201d Brand said. \u201cGerman exports shrank although world trade increased in 2024.\u201d",

And prospects for growth in the coming year are \u201cgloomy,\u201d he said, with the \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over the export-oriented economy from possible new U.S. trade measures such as higher tariffs on imported goods from the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office in less than a week.",
      "Despite the weak growth figures, the jobs market remains strong and disposable income is rising along with pay raises from new wage agreements aimed at making up for inflation.",
      "But a willingness to spend is being held back by worries fed by a range of factors, including a drumbeat of job cut announcements at major companies including Volkswagen, steelmaker and industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp and auto technology supplier Bosch, and by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Brand said that the economy is believed to have shrunk by 0.1% in the fourth quarter compared with the previous three-month period. That, however, is a rough initial estimate because hard economic data for December haven't yet been released."

      "LONDON -- Inflation in the U.K. unexpectedly fell in December, a move that will likely fuel pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates again next month.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said Wednesday that inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, was 2.5% in the year to December, largely as a result of easing price pressures in the services sector, which accounts for around 80% of the British economy.",
      "That was down from 2.6% the previous month. Economists had expected no change in the annual rate.",
      "Though inflation has fallen, it remains above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",
      "If the Bank of England decides to cut its main interest rate from 4.75%, it could well ease the pressure in British government bond markets, which have been volatile in recent weeks.",
      "The uptick in the interest rate investors are charging the British government to lend money over 10 years hit a 16-year high in recent days, piling pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves to cut spending or raise taxes in order to allay concerns.",
      "Inflation is way down from levels seen a couple of years ago, partly because central banks dramatically increased borrowing costs from near zero during the coronavirus pandemic when prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues and then because of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.",
      "As inflation rates have fallen from multidecade highs, central banks have started cutting interest rates, though few, if any, economists think that rates will fall back to the super-low levels that persisted in the years after the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.",

      "Long-range attacks have been a feature of the nearly three-year war, where on the front line snaking about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) from northeast to southern Ukraine, the armies have been engaged in a war of attrition. Russia has been advancing on the battlefield over the past year, though its progress has been slow and costly.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 43 missiles and 74 drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. A total of 30 missiles and 47 drones were shot down, and 27 drones failed to reach their target, it said.",
      "The Russian missiles sought out targets from the Lviv region in western Ukraine near Poland to Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine bordering Russia. The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in six regions. It often shuts down production during attacks as a precaution.",

      "U.S. inflation likely worsened last month on the back of higher prices for gas, eggs, and used cars, a trend that could make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate much this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation probably worsened last month on the back of higher prices for gas, eggs, and used cars, a trend that could make it less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate much this year.",
      "On Wednesday the Labor Department is expected to report that in December the consumer price index rose 2.8% from a year ago, according to economists surveyed by FactSet, up from a 2.7% yearly increase in November. It would be the third straight rise, after inflation fell to a 3 1/2 year low of 2.4% in September.",
      "The uptick could fuel ongoing concerns among many economists and in financial markets that inflation has gotten stuck above the Fed's 2% target. Such concerns have sent interest rates on Treasury securities higher, which has also pushed up borrowing costs for mortgages, cars, and credit cards, even as the Fed has cut its key rate.",
      "Last Friday's unexpectedly strong jobs report caused stock and bond prices to plunge on fears that a healthy economy could keep inflation elevated, preventing the Fed from cutting its key rate further.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, economists forecast that so-called core inflation remained at 3.3% in December for the fourth month in a row.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% in December for the second month in a row. Price increases at that pace would exceed the Fed's 2% target. Core prices are forecast to have risen 0.2%.",
      "Some of the uptick in prices was likely fueled by one-time factors, such as another jump in the cost of eggs, which has been one of the most volatile food categories in recent years. An outbreak of avian flu is decimating many chicken flocks, reducing egg supply.",
      "Economists generally expect inflation to decline a bit in the coming months, as apartment rental prices, wages, and car insurance costs grow more slowly. But clouding the outlook are potentially inflationary policies from President-elect Donald Trump. Trump has proposed to boost tariffs on all imports to the U.S. and to implement mass deportations of unauthorized migrants.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said that he would create the \u201cExternal Revenue Service\u201d to collect tariffs, suggesting he expects many duties to ultimately be imposed, even as he has also said he intends to use them as bargaining chips. During the campaign, he promised to impose up to 20% duties on all imports and as high as 60% tariffs on goods from China.",
      "Last week, minutes from the Fed's December meeting showed that economists at the central bank expect inflation to remain about the same this year as in 2024, pushed up a bit by higher tariffs.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank will keep its key interest rate elevated until inflation is back to 2%. As a result, Wall Street investors expect the Fed to cut its key rate just a single time this year, from its current level of 4.3%, according to futures prices.",
      "Other borrowing costs remain high, in part because of expectations for higher inflation and few Fed rate cuts. Mortgage rates, which are strongly influenced by the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rose for the fourth straight time last week to 6.9%, far above the pandemic-era lows of below 3%.",
      "With the job market resilient \u2014 the unemployment rate ticked down to a low 4.1% last month \u2014 consumers are able to keep spending and drive growth. If demand exceeds what companies can produce, however, that could fuel further inflation.",
      "Earlier this month, several prominent economists, including former Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke, agreed that the tariffs Trump will ultimately impose will probably only have minor effects on inflation. The issue was discussed at the American Economic Association's annual meeting in San Francisco.",
      "Jason Furman, a top economic adviser during the Obama administration, said at the conference that the duties may lift the annual inflation rate by just several tenths of a percentage point. But he added that even an increase of that size could be enough to affect the Fed's rate decisions.",
      "\u201cYou are in a world where the Trump policies are more like tenths, than something cataclysmic,\" he said Jan. 4. \"But I think we\u2019re also in a world where the direction of whether rates are staying the same, going down, or going up, depends on those tenths.\u201d"

      "A U.S. watchdog is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\u201d customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result",
      "NEW YORK -- A U.S. watchdog is suing Capital One for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts \u2014 and \u201ccheating\" customers out of more than $2 billion in lost interest payments as a result.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \u201c360 Savings\u201d accounts. Despite promoting 360 Savings as an account that provides one of nation's highest interest rates, the CFPB alleges that Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \u201c360 Performance Savings,\" which saw a much higher rate grow. But the agency says that Capital One did not notify 360 Savings accountholders about this new offering and \u201cinstead worked to keep them in the dark\" \u2014 alleging that the company marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\u201d those with 360 Savings accounts about 360 Performance Savings.",
      "These actions mean Capital One \u201cillegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\u201d the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it\u2019s seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\u201cBanks should not be baiting people with promises they can\u2019t live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \u201cdeeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\u201d",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \u201coffer great rates\u201d \u2014 and have \u201calways been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\u201d",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive. Analyst commentary from TD Cowen on Tuesday noted that the CFPB still brought enforcement actions under Trump's first term, for example, although such litigation may also be easier to settle under the incoming administration."

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Spirits giant Brown-Forman Corp. said Tuesday it's reducing its global workforce by about 12% and closing its hometown barrel-making plant in Louisville. The cost-cutting moves come as American whiskey producers face stiff challenges from changing consumer trends and renewed tariff threats.",
      "The actions are projected to produce about $70 million to $80 million in annualized cost savings, a portion of which is expected to be reinvested as part of the company's growth strategy, said Louisville-based Brown-Forman, whose flagship brand is Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey.",
      "The company's cooperage, where barrels are made to store and age its spirits, will close by April 25, affecting about 210 hourly and salaried employees, it said. The closure is part of the overall 12% reduction in the company's 5,400-employee global workforce. Brown-Forman said it will source barrels from an external supplier and expects to receive more than $30 million from selling cooperage assets.",
      "Laid-off workers will receive severance, outplacement services and other benefits, the company said.",
      "Brown-Forman also announced changes in its executive team, including the appointment of Jeremy Shepherd as chief marketing officer. Shepherd previously led its USA & Canada commercial division.",

      "Last month, Brown-Forman reported a 5% decline in net sales for the first six months of its fiscal year compared to the year-ago period. The decline was largely due to its Finlandia and Sonoma\u2011Cutrer divestitures, the company said. Whiting said the results came amid \u201cchallenging economic conditions\u201d but he predicted a stronger performance in the second half of the year. Brown-Forman's many brands also include Woodford Reserve and Old Forester bourbons and Herradura and el Jimador tequilas.",
      "The company's cutbacks come as the overall American whiskey sector faces headwinds that coincide with massive inventories of aging whiskeys that will someday reach the market. In Kentucky, a record 14.3 million barrels of bourbon are aging, the Kentucky Distillers\u2019 Association said last month.",
      "Industrywide challenges include indications that younger adults are drinking less alcohol and the threat of American whiskey getting entangled in another trade war. Meanwhile, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said recently that Americans should be better informed about the link between alcohol and cancer. The risk should be clearly labeled on drinks Americans consume, Murthy proposed.",
      "Republican President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose new tariffs with his return to the White House. During Trump's first term, American whiskey distillers got caught up in a trans-Atlantic trade fight, causing deep drops in exports to the European Union \u2014 the industry\u2019s biggest overseas market. The EU imposed a retaliatory tariff on those spirits in 2018 in response to Trump\u2019s decision to slap tariffs on European steel and aluminum. A 2021 deal suspended those tariffs on American spirits, and U.S. distillers began clawing back lost market share in the EU.",
      "However, the EU is set to reinstate tariffs on American spirits at a 50% rate in March if nothing is done to head it off, the Kentucky Distillers' Association said. Retaliatory tariffs from the EU and other countries have cost Kentucky's bourbon industry a half-billion dollars in exports since 2018, it said. Kentucky and Tennessee, where Jack Daniel's is crafted, overwhelmingly backed Trump in last year's election.",
      "\u201cWe are up against a triple threat of back-breaking tariffs, snowballing taxes and shifts in consumer trends that have slowed sales,\u201d Eric Gregory, president of the distillers\u2019 association, said recently."

      "MADRID -- Spain is planning a raft of measures to address its brewing housing crisis, including an up to 100% tax on properties bought by non-European Union residents.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced the plan this week to tackle housing affordability and high rents in the Southern European nation. He said that the overall goal was to provide \u201cmore housing, better regulation and greater aid.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and the poor tenants,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said as he announced the plan.",
      "However, it remains unclear if the plan put forth by S\u00e1nchez\u2019s minority coalition will pass in parliament. Here's a look at what's happening:",
      "Like most rich countries, Spain is in the throes of a growing housing affordability problem. Skyrocketing rents are particularly acute in cities like Barcelona and Madrid, where incomes have failed to keep up, especially for young people. Housing prices are also steadily rising, especially in cities and coastal areas.",
      "Rental prices have also been driven up by short-term contracts mainly offered for tourists. Spain sees more tourists than almost any country in the world, having received more than 88.5 million visitors in 2024. Tourism is one of the country's key economic drivers.",
      "The negative aspects of mass tourism have caused tension at times between visitors and residents concerned about rising costs, the proliferation of short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb, and water supplies that can be stretched in some parts of the country, including the Canary and Balearic Islands.",
      "Last year, protesters took to the streets on various occasions across the country to express their frustrations about the growth of tourism and high rents. Barcelona\u2019s town hall has pledged to completely eliminate all short-term rentals to tourists in the coming years.",
      "\u201cWhat citizens expect from us here is action,\u201d Spanish housing minister Isabel Rodr\u00edguez told reporters on Tuesday about the plan.",
      "Spain plans to limit the number of homes foreigners purchase by raising taxes on properties bought by non-European Union residents by up to 100%.",
      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, \u201cnot to live in\u201d but \u201cto make money from,\" S\u00e1nchez said. He didn\u2019t provide a timeline or details on how he plans to implement the tax.",
      "\u201cThis would be massive,\u201d said Sarah Conroy, an English real estate agent who has been working in realty in the upscale Marbella market in southern Spain for over three decades. She didn't give figures on how many non-EU clients she had, but said they included post-Brexit British buyers as well as clients from Saudi Arabia ad Dubai.",
      "\u201cThey need to do something because the people living here can't really rent anything because it is so expensive,\" Conroy said. \"Personally speaking, around 80% of the people I sell to are buying second homes.\u201d",
      "Spain plans to build more public housing and allocate around 2 million square meters (21.5 million square feet) of residential land to a newly created public housing agency.",
      "Other proposed measures include higher taxes on holiday rentals, tax breaks and protections for landlords who provide affordable housing, and amending laws to speed up construction processes and expand the availability of land for private construction.",
      "The rising cost of living has driven voter discontent across many wealthy countries in recent years, including the United States.",
      "But as one of Europe\u2019s leading Socialist politicians, the housing crunch is a crucial question for S\u00e1nchez to resolve as he tries to keep his left-wing minority coalition afloat after winning another four-year term in 2023.",
      "Also, according to the Spanish Constitution, all Spaniards have the right to enjoy a \"decent and adequate\u201d home. In theory, at least, the government has a duty to allow citizens to exercise that right.",

      "PALM DESERT, Calif. -- Canada's ambassador to Washington said Monday that Canada is prepared to buy more from the United States, including its next fleet of submarines, to appease President-elect Donald Trump's concerns about the U.S.-Canada trade deficit.",
      "Ambassador Kirsten Hillman also warned Americans in an interview with The Associated Press that prices will go up for Americans almost immediately if Trump follows through with his plan to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products.",
      "The ambassador also dismissed Trump\u2019s talk of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, saying that\u2019s how Trump negotiates.",
      "\u201cHe has a negotiating style which involves positioning himself in the best way he can for discussions. I think that is what this is,\u201d Hillman told the AP.",
      "Trump continues to erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "Hillman noted Canada buys more from the United States than any other country but is prepared to buy more.",
      "\u201cWe are happy to source what we can from the United States. And we have some big military procurements coming up for example, replacing our entire submarine fleet,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe those are some purchases that can happen from the U.S.\u201d",
      "Hillman said 70% of Canada's military procurement is American sourced. That includes a plan to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets.",
      "Alberta's Premier Danielle Smith said earlier Monday she favors appeasing Trump by trying to narrow the trade gap, saying the solution is that Canada finds ways to buy more American goods. Smith visited Mar-a-Lago, Trump's home in Florida, over the weekend and spoke to Trump.",
      "Hillman has said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. is energy exports.",
      "Hillman said trade with Canada supports over 8 million jobs in the United States and Canada is the number one customer to 36 U.S. states. She said Canada provides a lot of primary materials that go into U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"Adding 25% tariffs to those products will raise the price for Americans almost immediately,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cAnd at a time when the cost of living is challenging, when food prices are high, it seems like the wrong direction to go in.\"",
      "Hillman also reiterated that Canada will retaliate if tariffs are placed on Canadian goods and that will mean a cost for Americans.",
      "\u201cCanada will respond,\" she said. \u201cTherefore your number one customer will make American products more expensive and Canadians will probably look for alternatives to those products.\u201d",
      "Hillman said Canada is not interested in a trade war but said it will be hard for the Canadian government to not respond if the U.S. government makes choices that hurt Canadians.",
      "She said it doesn't make sense for Trump to reverse what he accomplished in his first term when he renegotiated the free trade deal with Canada and Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe are 99% tariff free with the United States, 99% tariff free. And that tariff level is as a result of the USMCA,\u201d Hillman said, referring to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. \u201cThat was negotiated by President Trump. He achieved that success so why would we backtrack from this success that he achieved in his last administration. It just doesn\u2019t make a lot sense.\"",
      "Hillman gave Trump credit for accelerating Canada's plans to increase security at the border. Trump initially threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian goods if the government does not stem what Trump calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the U.S. \u2014 even though far fewer of each crosses into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico, which Trump has also threatened.",
      "Canada now has a billion plus border security plan.",
      "\u201cWe have moved really quickly, I\u2019ll be honest, because President Trump focused the mind to put together a full package of improvements,\" Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said also said the U.S. and Canada are in a \u201cgenerational struggle\" with China, a powerful adversary. Trump has been clear about the economic and security threat that Beijing poses, she said. The ambassador said Canada has the energy America needs to drive the artificial intelligence revolution.",
      "\"That is really not possible, based on our experts and American experts, without greater cooperation with Canada through oil and gas, through nuclear, through hydro electricity,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "\u201cIf we are working at odds then frankly China wins. China is trying to drive us apart. That is clear. They look for every opportunity to do so. That\u2019s not good for us, our citizens and Americans.\u201d"

      "The conversations around the dinner table can sometimes turn spicy between the Macuga sisters when one particular topic gets brought up: Whose winter event is more demanding.",
      "The trio each make compelling cases. Alli, the moguls standout, touts the knee-jarring bumps and jumps; Lauren, the downhill ski racer, cites speeds in excess of 70 mph (112.6 kph) along an icy course; and Sam, the ski jumper, offers up soaring through the air after launching off a fear-inspiring jump.",
      "Mom and dad just soak it all in.",
      "\u201cWe get a kick out of listening to them argue over whose sport is harder or more entertaining,\u201d said their father, Dan, whose son, Daniel, also is an up-and-coming ski racer. \u201cThe banter between them is just fantastic.\u201d",
      "One thing these tight-knit sisters can agree on: Just how special it would be should all three make the U.S. team for the Milan-Cortina Olympics next winter.",
      "Now that would be quite a family reunion. It\u2019s a real possibility, too. Alli, 21, had two World Cup podium finishes last season, while Sam, who turns 24 next month, is among the top American ski jumpers. Then there\u2019s Lauren, the 22-year-old who\u2019s coming off her first career World Cup win last weekend in Austria in the super-G.",
      "\u201cWe just watch all of them in awe,\u201d their father said.",
      "Each sibling was born in a different state \u2014 Sam in California, Lauren in Michigan, Alli in Washington and Daniel in Texas. Living in Dallas, an opportunity came around for the family to settle down in Park City, Utah.",
      "Amy and Dan jumped at the chance. Recreational skiers, they got their young kids involved through the Youth Sports Alliance, a program set up after the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics to encourage children to try different winter sports.",
      "Sam eventually gravitated toward ski jumping, where the elite jumpers sit on a bar about as high as a 40-story building until they glide down the runway and see how far they can fly.",
      "\u201cI remember Sam just said, \u2018Mom, dad, I\u2019m going to do this,\u2019\u201d recalled Lauren, who's competing in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, this weekend at the venue for the upcoming Olympics. \u201cI think they just thought she was skiing over jumps. And then it turns out she was jumping these HUGE jumps.\u201d",
      "For Lauren, it was the thrill of speed that led her to ski racing (once she conquered the fear). This offered an early hint of her potential: She won a junior national event with a borrowed race suit and on a pair of skis where the bottom looked as if she'd just rolled across a gravel parking lot.",
      "In the case of Alli, she tried out a little bit of everything \u2014 aerials, slopestyle, halfpipe, big mountain \u2014 before being drawn into the world of moguls by the combination of bumps and flips.",
      "A side benefit to competing in different disciplines? No sibling rivalries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to have my \u2018thing\u2019 and be able to tune in and cheer for my other siblings as they do theirs,\u201d Sam said. \u201cComparing experiences and stories is so cool.\u201d",
      "Of course, all of them think their event is the most challenging. None of them, though, really want to do the other\u2019s discipline.",
      "Alli on Sam's ski jumping: \u201cWhile the idea of literally flying sounds amazing, I\u2019ll stick with the smaller airs rather than sending myself down a giant hill.\u201d",
      "Sam on Alli and the moguls: \u201cThat\u2019s definitely a sport I\u2019m leaving to the professionals (Alli).\u201d",
      "Alli on Lauren and the downhill: \u201cProps to her for being able to go that fast down a hill and still be giggling in the finish.\u201d",
      "Lauren had plenty to smile about last Sunday in St. Anton, when she captured her first World Cup win. Her childhood idol, Lindsey Vonn, even came over to the leader\u2019s box and gave her a celebratory hug (Vonn took fourth). It meant the world to Lauren, who counts a slalom ski from Vonn (or so she's been told) as a prized possession.",
      "One of the best parts for Lauren was the call home to share the news of her victory. It was still early back in Utah and her father was sleeping.",
      "\u201cHe was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong? Are you OK?\u2018\u201d Lauren said with a laugh. \u201cI was like, \u201cDad, I won!\u2019\"",
      "Meanwhile, Alli was getting ready to be taken to the airport by her mother.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it and rushed downstairs and we were both in shock,\" Alli said. \"It was so surreal to see her on the winner\u2019s chair.\u201d",
      "Sam was skiing in Norway with no cell service, but \"she called me the moment she had service and was like, \u2018What the heck?\u2019\u201d said Lauren, whose known for wearing bucket hats, of which she currently has around 26. \u201cIt was so fun.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to keep track of all their training and travel schedules. That\u2019s why their mom created the \u201cMacuga Calendar,\u201d a detailed, color-coded spreadsheet.",
      "This week, for instance, there\u2019s notations for Lauren racing in Cortina; Alli getting ready to travel to Waterville Valley in New Hampshire for a World Cup event; 19-year-old Daniel competing in a series of races at Mt. Bachelor in Oregon; and Sam preparing an event in Sapporo, Japan, where Amy and Dan were also heading. The calendar also features a \u201cnotes\u201d section to make sure their dogs are well taken care of while they're away.",
      "It\u2019s an invaluable tool.",

      "Should all three sisters make their Olympic teams, it will present another logistical challenge. Their disciplines spread out all over Italy, with moguls in Livigno, ski jumping in Predazzo and ski racing in Cortina. They\u2019re hours from each other.",

      "Three of the home teams are favorites by at least six points, according to Bet MGM Sportsbook.",
      "Line: Chiefs minus 8 1/2",
      "Kansas City\u2019s quest for a three-peat starts against the Texans, who are coming off an impressive 32-12 win over the Los Angeles Chargers. Stroud made big plays with his arm and even had a career-long 27-yard run that sparked the offense against Los Angeles. Houston\u2019s defense baffled Justin Herbert, forcing four interceptions, including a pair by All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley. If Stroud and the offense avoid turnovers and Joe Mixon has another 100-yard game rushing, the Texans can keep Mahomes off the field and have a chance to pull off the upset.",
      "The Chiefs beat the Texans 27-19 in Week 16. They were home for that one, too. Houston lost wide receiver Tank Dell to a knee injury on a touchdown catch in that game. Mahomes finished the season with 11 TDs and zero picks in his last six games. After sitting out in Week 18 and a bye, Mahomes and most of the starters have to avoid being rusty in their first game action in three weeks.",
      "The Chiefs are 8-0 with Mahomes in the divisional and wild-card rounds. They\u2019re 6-0 against the spread in their past six playoff games. But Kansas City is 22-32-3 ATS as a favorite of at least seven points with Mahomes, including 0-5-1 this season.",
      "CHIEFS: 27-17",
      "Line: Lions minus 9 1/2",
      "The Commanders keep finding ways to win late with five straight victories coming down to the final play. The victory in Tampa Bay was the franchise\u2019s first playoff win since 2006. Daniels connected often with Terry McLaurin and Dyami Brown, but Washington will need Brian Robinson and Austin Ekeler to run more effectively to have a chance against Detroit. A defense that held Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers to their worst game in eight weeks has to step up against the most dynamic offense in the NFL.",
      "The Lions could get running back David Montgomery back to join Jahmyr Gibbs in an elite backfield. That should open things up even more for Jared Goff throwing to All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and other playmakers.",
      "Since the NFL expanded to 14 playoff teams with only two getting a bye, No. 1 seeds are 3-5 against the spread in the divisional round.",

      "Jalen Hurts shook off the rust after a three-week layoff and the Eagles relied on a stout defense to beat the Packers 22-10 last week.",
      "The Rams used a dominant defensive effort to eliminate the Vikings, sacking Sam Darnold nine times in a 27-9 victory. Getting to Hurts won\u2019t be that easy behind an offensive line that features five guys who received All-Pro votes.",
      "Plus, the Eagles are going to run the ball often with Barkley, who set a franchise record with 255 yards rushing in a 37-20 win in Los Angeles on Nov. 24.",
      "Rams coach Sean McVay vs. Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio should be a classic head-to-head matchup. Matthew Stafford had success throwing against Philly\u2019s No. 1 defense in the previous meeting. He connected with Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp 17 times for 177 of his 243 yards passing.",
      "The Rams have to travel cross-country and have one less day of rest following a Monday night win. But McVay is 16-7 against the spread on short rest, going 7-1 ATS in his past eight games. With Stafford at quarterback, McVay is 8-2 ATS on short rest.",
      "Still, playing in Philadelphia in January is different and the Eagles are 6-0 straight up at home in the divisional round, covering the spread in five of those games.",
      "BEST BET: EAGLES: 29-17",
      "Line: Ravens minus 1",
      "Jackson vs. Allen gets all the hype but this isn\u2019t going to decide the NFL MVP. Votes were cast before the playoffs started. Jackson, who earned All-Pro honors, led Baltimore to a 28-14 win against Pittsburgh last week while Allen and the Bills routed Denver 31-7.",
      "The Ravens put a 35-10 beatdown on the Bills at home in Week 4. They\u2019re road favorites, a sign of disrespect for Buffalo. The Bills haven\u2019t been home underdogs in the playoffs since 1967 against the Chiefs.",
      "Buffalo\u2019s defense has a tough task trying to slow down Jackson and Derrick Henry. Greg Rousseau, Von Miller and Ed Oliver need to pressure Jackson and somehow keep him contained.",
      "Baltimore has to do the same against an offense led by Allen and James Cook. Ravens rookie cornerback Nate Wiggins on Bills rookie receiver Keon Coleman should be a fun matchup.",

      "Top Japanese players traditionally have signed first with Nippon Professional Baseball clubs and established their professional credentials before moving to MLB as free agents or through the MLB-NPB posting process.

      "\u201cKeep following my dream to become a great player,\u201d Morii said through a translator during a Zoom news conference, wearing a gold A's jersey over a dress shirt, a green-and-gold club cap on his head. \u201cI didn't want to regret about my decision when I think about my whole life and whole career.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very talented baseball player with enough athleticism and mobility to play both shortstop and pitch,\u201d assistant general manager Dan Feinstein said. \u201cBut beyond his physical ability, the thing that jumped out at us the most is his passion for the game and his unwavering desire to be one of the next great players from Japan.\u201d",
      "Morii already was in the U.S. He will head home for a bit before reporting to the A's in March.",
      "Morii emphasized with teams he spoke with that he wanted to be a two-way player. His decision was yet another offseason move by the A's, who left Oakland and intend to play three seasons in West Sacramento, California, before moving to a planned ballpark in Las Vegas.",

      "The TCU women's basketball team had to forfeit two games and conduct open tryouts on campus last January because it didn\u2019t have enough healthy players",
      "FORT WORTH, Texas -- The TCU women had to forfeit two games and conduct open tryouts on campus last January because they didn't have enough healthy players.",
      "A year later, with Sedona Prince and Madison Conner both healthy and joined in the lineup by standout transfer Hailey Van Lith, the Horned Frogs (18-1) are a top-10 team and on a nine-game winning streak that includes their first 6-0 start in the Big 12 Conference.",
      "\u201cGone from the \u2018Underfrogs\u2019 and holding open tryouts to this week being ranked in the top 10 ... it's been a very magical ride,\u201d second-year TCU coach Mark Campbell said.",
      "TCU won its first 14 games in Campbell\u2019s debut last season, but Prince (broken finger) and Conner (MCL) got sidelined by injuries and senior point guard Jaden Owens sustained a season-ending knee injury within a couple of weeks after that school-record start. That left the Frogs with six available scholarship players, and two of them were on minutes restrictions coming off their own injuries.",
      "About 40 students then went through tryouts on campus the same week that TCU forfeited Big 12 games against Kansas State and Iowa State. Four of them were added to the roster before the season resumed with a 66-60 win at home last Jan. 23 over UCF, the same team the 10th-ranked Frogs beat 90-81 at home Tuesday night for their second nine-game winning streak this season.",
      "\u201cThe game that laid the foundation for TCU was a year ago when we played UCF here,\u201d Campbell said after the latest win over the Knights. \u201cToday was a really special game for our program, for the people that were a part of that game a year ago. There\u2019s a huge mural in our offices of pictures from that game that will be up there as long as I get to coach here.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-7 Prince had 27 points on 11-of-15 shooting and seven rebounds against UCF this week. Van Lith scored 20 points while matching her career high with six 3-pointers and had seven assists without a turnover, while Conner made four 3s while scoring 14 points and having six assists. The Frogs had assists on 29 of their 32 made field goals and finished with 15 3-pointers, their most ever in a Big 12 game.",
      "TCU's current nine-game winning streak followed an 85-52 loss to reigning national champion South Carolina on Dec. 8. That came at the end of the first week that the Frogs had ever been in the top 10 \u2014 then at No. 9.",
      "\u201cThat game probably is going to be the biggest blessing of our season. Honestly, it taught me a lot personally, but I think our team a lot. Each person learned different things that were needed for the rest of the season,\u201d Prince, a former Oregon player, said this week. \u201cThis is the most fun group I\u2019ve ever played with in my entire college career, my entire probably basketball career in my life.\u201d",
      "The Frogs are seeking their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2010.",
      "The four walk-ons added to the roster after open tryouts on campus last January became known as the \u201cUnderfrogs.\u201d",
      "Sophomore guard Ella Hamlin from nearby Granbury, Texas, the only of those four still with the team, is now on a full scholarship. An emotional Campbell surprised Hamlin with that news in the locker room after the win over UCF on Tuesday night, the timing being specific and symbolic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. ... It\u2019s just amazing to look back and see like how far it\u2019s come,\u201d said Hamlin, who has played only 23 minutes while appearing in 10 games this season.",
      "\u201cElla\u2019s the lone survivor,\" Campbell said. \"When adversity hits, most people avoid adversity, run away for adversity. The four \u2018Underfrogs', they showed up when we needed somebody.\u201d",
      "The Frogs play ranked teams in three of their next five games. They host No. 23 Utah on Friday night, which will be their first time in the AP Top 25 when hosting another ranked opponent since losing to Oklahoma State on Feb. 7, 2018.",
      "TCU next week goes to No. 24 Oklahoma State, then hosts Baylor and goes to Iowa State before a game on Feb. 5 at 11th-ranked Kansas State (17-1, 5-0), the only other Big 12 team without a conference loss.",

      "Kluetmeier died Tuesday due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s disease and a stroke, according to his longtime employer, Sports Illustrated. He was considered a pioneer in remote and underwater camera technology.",
      "\u201cBesides his body of work, he left an impression on everybody that he met or worked with,\" said New York City-based photographer Jeff Kavanaugh, who worked alongside Kluetmeier for decades. \u201cIn some ways, that was a great impression. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t. But all in all, it\u2019s just the drive and the determination and just the sheer genius of some of the things that he engineered.",
      "\u201cThe advances that he helped bring along, especially in sports photography, he\u2019ll be remembered for that.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier was born in Germany in 1942 and moved with his family to Milwaukee at age 9. He was introduced to the idea of a career in photojournalism when pictures of him and his pet parakeet, Chirpy, were published by The Associated Press.",
      "By age 15, he was shooting photos for the AP. Using a Nikon S camera that his parents bought him, he began freelancing for the AP and the Milwaukee Journal.",
      "He once recalled driving to Green Bay while the Packers were in training camp. He walked into the cafeteria at St. Norbert College with a camera around his neck, only to be accosted by coach Vince Lombardi.",
      "\u201cKid, what are you doing here?\u201d Lombardi asked.",
      "Kluetmeier explained that he was assigned to take pictures of Bart Starr, Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor for the AP. Lombardi turned and shouted: \u201cStarr! Taylor! Hornung! Get over here! This kid wants to take some pictures of you guys!\u201d",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe my luck,\u201d Kluetmeier said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine something like that happening today.\u201d",
      "Kluetmeier joined the Journal staff a few years later. In 1969, before he turned 30, Heinz was poached by Time Inc. to work for Life and SI.",
      "He worked countless Olympic Games beginning in 1972 \u2014 his first SI cover featured seven-time gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz \u2014 as well as Super Bowls, World Series, Kentucky Derbies and Indy 500s. He also photographed President John F. Kennedy on the campaign trail.",
      "His most notable images came from the Olympics, though. His photo of the United States celebrating its victory against Russia in the Lake Placid Games \u2014 shot with a handheld camera from the stands \u2014 is among the most famous sports images of the 20th century. It donned the SI cover without a headline or a caption.",
      "Kluetmeier, who earned an engineering degree, was the first to experiment with an underwater camera during the world swimming championships in Perth, Australia, in 1991 and had mastered the technique by the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The NASCAR team owned by Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr. will attempt to make its Cup Series debut in the Daytona 500 with a champion driver and a partnership with a Grammy Award-winning artist.",
      "JR Motorsports has entered reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier into next month's season-opening \u201cGreat American Race\u201d in a Chevrolet sponsored by the whiskey label created by 10-time Grammy winner Chris Stapleton. Traveller Whiskey is a collaborative blend created by Buffalo Trace Distillery with Stapleton.",
      "Allgaier will have to qualify for the Daytona 500 \u2014 a race his boss has won twice \u2014 on either speed in time trials or via one of the qualifying races. It marks the first time in JRM history the team has entered a race in the Cup Series, and Earnhardt said the team will be focused on qualifying via speed powered by a Hendrick Motorsports engine.",
      "The deal came together when Stapleton, who has a friendship with Rick Hendrick, approached Hendrick about a NASCAR collaboration with Traveller Whiskey. Hendrick put Stapleton in touch with Earnhardt as he also has an ownership stake with JRM.",
      "\u201cWe had this whiskey and I always have \u201dpie in the sky\" dreams of things to do and we knocked on the door a little bit,\" Stapleton told The Associated Press. \u201cIf I'm being 100% honest, I just thought it would be cool to see whiskey on a car. And he brought up Dale Jr. and I was like \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t we do that if we can?' This is a lot of my audience, for both whiskey and country music, and what (Earnhardt) does in auto racing.\u201d",
      "The third-party introduction is helping Earnhardt and his sister, Kelley Earnhardt-Miller, attempt to make a dream come true for their race team.",
      "\u201cI shared with Rick that for a very long time that I had a dream, at one time in my life, of entering the Daytona 500 as a car owner,\u201d Earnhardt told AP. \u201cRick presented the opportunity to connect with Chris and his team, they were interested in marketing in our sport, and Rick knew that I was wanting to fulfill this opportunity. It was like two people that wanted the same thing.\u201d",
      "The Earnhardts have led JRM to 88 Xfinity Series victories with drivers Chase Elliott, William Byron, Tyler Reddick and Allgaier last November. JRM is starting its 24th year of overall competition with four cars in NASCAR's second-tier Xfinity Series.",
      "JRM has never attempted to enter a Cup race. The Earnhardts have expressed interest in moving up to Cup competition, but have balked at purchasing the eight-figure charter needed to compete.",
      "Earnhardt said there have been no discussions on future Cup ventures for JRM beyond trying to make the Daytona 500. It will be a high-pressure situation for the Greg Ives-led team as Earnhardt has warned them he and his sister will be hovering from the moment the car is unloaded at Daytona Beach International Speedway through every mile it turns on the track.",
      "Stapleton also plans to attend what will be his first Daytona 500. He and Earnhardt said the musician was intricately involved in the car design, which Stapleton saw in person for the first time Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI'm a bit of a retro guy, I like things that are kind of a throwback,\u201d Stapleton said. \u201cSo I was looking for a little bit of that flavor in the car, but also something that really blended JR Motorsports and Traveller Whiskey. It had to look like both of those things and I think we achieved it.\u201d",
      "Aside from promoting his whiskey, Stapleton is hoping the Daytona 500 turns into a core memory of his accomplished career.",
      "\u201cI wanted to build a thing \u2014 I wanted to see the car and I want to see it run. And that, for me, would be the victory,\u201d Stapleton said. \"And I want the moment of it. It's just like going to the Super Bowl and getting to stay on the sidelines. That's what I want. I want the moment, the moment of the synergy that is happening.",
      "\u201cWhatever comes of it, we still did it.\u201d",
      "Allgaier is the defending Xfinity Series champion and former Cup Series driver who ran the Daytona 500 in 2014 and 2015. His most recent time in a Cup car was last May as the substitute driver for Kyle Larson as Larson attempted to compete in both the Coca-Cola 600 and Indianapolis 500 on the same day.",
      "Allgaier started the Coke 600 for Larson and was credited with a 13th-place finish when the race was called for rain.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredible honor to be driving JR Motorsports\u2019 inaugural entry into the Cup Series,\u201d said Allgaier. \u201cEntering into the Daytona 500 has been a goal of this company for a long time and I know that we are going to have everything we need to go out and contend for the win. This is going to be special for sure.\u201d",

      "The Texas Rangers are making their regional game broadcasts available directly to consumers in a streaming package they say is the first step in providing multiple viewing options after several seasons of access issues.",
      "The MLB team announced Wednesday it entered into a multiyear agreement with A Parent Media Co. Inc. (APMC) to stream Rangers regional games on the Victory+ service starting this year.",
      "That is the same streaming service that took over regional broadcasts for the NHL's Dallas Stars this season. While Stars games and extra content are streamed for free, access for Rangers games will cost $100 for the full season.",
      "\u201cThe Rangers\u2019 partnership with Victory+ as our direct-to-consumer provider is a tremendous first step as the club continues to finalize our television offerings for 2025 game broadcasts,\u201d said COO Neil Leibman, the team's president of business operations. \u201cVictory+ has proven itself over the past few months as a reliable streaming home for several professional sports teams, and we feel Rangers fans will enjoy the familiarity, convenience and simplicity of this service.\u201d",
      "While the team didn't say what the additional options will be, those could include traditional cable and possibly some over-the-air broadcasts. The Rangers, who have more than 16 million households in their broadcast territory over parts of five states, said details about those options would be announced in the coming weeks.",
      "Both the Rangers and Stars previously had their regional broadcasts on Bally Sports Southwest, part of the financially troubled Diamond Sports Group that has gone through a bankruptcy reorganization. The Stars and Diamond mutually agreed last summer to end their existing rights agreement. The Rangers' deal with the group expired at the end of last season.",
      "With Bally Sports Southwest not available through some cable companies and many popular streaming platforms, there were times when fans of the Rangers, Stars and NBA's Dallas Mavericks had issues trying to watch games during a period when all of those teams were having success.

    "story": [
      "The Pittsburgh Penguins could be moving on from two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins ran out of patience waiting for two-time All-Star goaltender Tristan Jarry to emerge from a slump, placing him on waivers Wednesday ahead of a pivotal seven-game road trip that could determine the course of the rest of their season.",
      "The 29-year-old Jarry is 8-7-4 with a 3.32 goals against average and a .886 save percentage this season for Pittsburgh, which is on the fringe of the playoff race in the Eastern Conference due in large part to subpar play in net.",
      "The Penguins have allowed an NHL-high 173 goals, with neither Jarry nor Alex Nedeljkovic establishing themselves behind a defense prone to lapses.",
      "The Penguins will call up promising rookie Joel Blomqvist to join Nedeljkovic on the road trip, which starts on Friday in Buffalo. Blomqvist went 3-5 with a 3.60 goals against average and a .904 save percentage during a stint in Pittsburgh earlier in the season.",
      "It seems unlikely a team would be willing to claim Jarry and pick up his salary, meaning Jarry will be reassigned to the Penguins' American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton once he clears waivers.",
      "\u201cAt this point, (I) just feel it's best in the long run for the team and for Tristan to allow Joel to come up here,\" Pittsburgh general manager Kyle Dubas said Wednesday. \u201cWe think over the past year-and-a-half, with his play in Wilkes-Barre and when he's been up here with us, he's earned the right to have a go at it.\u201d",
      "The decision comes 18 months after Dubas signed Jarry to a five-year deal with an average annual value of $5.375 million. Jarry was an All-Star in 2020 and 2022 but has struggled most of the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s continued to come in here, put the work in and that\u2019s not been a question at all,\u201d Dubas said. \"That just hasn\u2019t materialized the way we would like it to on the ice. At this level, you get to the point where you have to do what\u2019s right ... for him and for us.\u201d",
      "Jarry ceded the starting job to Nedeljkovic last spring. While he reclaimed his spot atop the depth chart coming out of training camp, he stumbled out of the gate and was sent to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton for a lengthy conditioning stint.",
      "While there was a brief uptick in his play after he returned, Jarry has lost five straight starts and continues to struggle early in games. He's allowed a goal on an opponent's first shot six times this season and allowed a shorthanded goal on Seattle's second shot in a 4-2 defeat to the Kraken on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWhen you lose, this is the kind of stuff that can happen,\u201d Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said Wednesday. \"A goaltender already has a ton of pressure, and it\u2019s difficult for us because we feel like as a team we\u2019re responsible if we don\u2019t give our goalies enough help sometimes. I think that\u2019s the tough part.\u201d",
      "Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan, who took his team to task for defensive letdowns in the third period against the Kraken that opened up the door for Seattle's comeback, believes there's a chance Jarry will make his way back at some point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you make the All-Star team twice if you don\u2019t have a certain level of talent and you\u2019re not capable of making timely saves,\u201d Sullivan said. \"So, I know that Tristan has it. I believe to my core that he\u2019s an NHL goaltender.\u201d",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas junior quarterback Quinn Ewers declared for the NFL draft on Wednesday, ending a Longhorns career in which he led the program to a Big 12 championship and twice to the College Football Playoff but was not always embraced by a fan base eagerly waiting for Arch Manning to take over.",
      "Ewers passed for 9,128 yards and 68 touchdowns in a career that few Texas quarterbacks can match. He had hinted before the season ended that it would be his last in college.",
      "\u201cThese past three years have been some of the best years I could have imagined,\u201d Ewers said in social media post announcing his decision. \u201cThe relationships I've built between coaches and teammates will last forever.\u201d",
      "His 27 career wins rank fourth as a starting quarterback at Texas, and he led the Longhorns to their first Big 12 title in 14 years in 2023 before the program moved to the Southeastern Conference. In their first season in the SEC, the Longhorns rose to their first No. 1 ranking since 2008 and played in the league championship game.",
      "Ewers' biggest legacy will be leading the program to the playoff semifinals in consecutive years, though it fell short of the championship game. He had a fumble on a sack that led to a game-clinching touchdown for Ohio State on Jan. 10 in the Cotton Bowl.",
      "Ewers, who grew up in the Dallas suburbs, was the top-rated high school quarterback in the country when he signed with Ohio State and left school early to the join the Buckeyes for the 2021 season. But after one season spent deep on the Ohio State depth chart, Ewers transferred to Texas, which had just finished 5-7 in coach Steve Sarkisian's first season.",
      "He was the starter by the season opener in 2022 and led the team through seasons of 8-5, 12-2 and 13-3 records. But he was dogged by various shoulder, abdomen and ankle injuries and missed at least two games each season. An abdomen strain this season allowed Manning to start twice and earn the program's first SEC win, which came against Mississippi State.",
      "Ewers' departure sets the stage for Manning to take over in 2025.",
      "The son of Cooper Manning, the grandson of former NFL quarterback Archie Manning and the nephew of Super Bowl-winning QBs Peyton and Eli Manning passed for 939 yards and nine touchdowns and ran for four TDs this season but has seen only limited playing time since September.",
      "Texas fans have been eagerly awaiting his chance to be the full-time starter. Manning will get it with a rebuilt offense.",
      "Top receivers Matthew Golden and Isaiah Bond have declared for the draft and senior tight end Gunnar Helm completed his eligibility. Running back Jaydon Blue, who scored a team-high 14 touchdowns including four in the playoffs, and starting tackles Kelvin Banks Jr. and Cam Williams also left for the NFL.",

      "CEO Ju'Riese Colon sent an email to more than 70 U.S. Olympic leaders Sunday, shortly after The Associated Press published a story about former investigator Jason Krasley's arrest on rape and sex-trafficking charges.",
      "\u201cI am angry and so disappointed,\u201d Colon wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by the AP. \u201cI\u2019m sad for our organization and the impact this may have on athletes. And I\u2019m sure many of you, as well as your members, are feeling a range of emotions as well. This work is so hard, and to know that someone could have not only fooled us, but also law enforcement, is just sickening.\u201d",
      "In the email to leaders at the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee and its affiliated sports organizations, Colon said the center has hired an outside party to evaluate cases Krasley had handled.",
      "\u201cWhile we do not have any reason to believe he committed any wrongdoing while at the Center, the audit may result in the Center re-opening cases,\u201d Colon said.",

      "\u201cBecause we have many checks built into our investigative process, we do not anticipate that we will need to re-open many, if any, cases,\u201d the employee wrote in that email, which was seen by the AP.",
      "The center was established in 2017 to investigate and deliver sanctions in sex-abuse cases involving Olympic sports after scandals involving Larry Nassar and others framed the USOPC and its sports organizations as not up to the task of properly handling those cases.",
      "Late last year, the center had 36 people on its investigations team. At the end of 2023, the center had 2,040 people listed on its centralized disciplinary database who had either been restricted or banned from sports participation.",
      "Colon said in her email that the center fired Krasley promptly after learning he'd been arrested for allegedly stealing $5,500 from a drug bust he helped conduct while on the vice squad with the police department in Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "About six weeks after that arrest came Krasley's arrest on rape, involuntary sexual servitude and other related charges.",
      "\"These charges are far more serious than the last, are despicable if true, and certainly put the Center back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons,\" Colon wrote.",
      "Krasley was released on $750,000 bond shortly after the arrest.",
      "The affidavit in the case was unsealed and, according to lehighcountylive.com, alleges another officer arrested in the case, Evan Weaver, told the victim she could avoid prison by performing a sex act on him after arresting her on a drug charge in 2011.",
      "Four years later, the affidavit says, Krasley contacted the victim as part of a prostitution sting and when she asked if she was going to jail, he allegedly replied: \u201cWhy would I take you to jail? You know what you need to do,\u201d before raping the victim.",
      "Krasley's lawyer, James Burke, told the AP his client denies the allegations and called it \u201cbizarre\u201d that these arrests were happening nearly a decade after an investigation into the episode had been completed. Burke said Krasley had been a decorated member of the police force before leaving in 2021, shortly after which he started work at the SafeSport center.",
      "None of the allegations surfaced during the SafeSport background check. In the email, Colon said the center was \u201cevaluating our screening and hiring practices.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis situation is unprecedented for the Center,\u201d Colon said. \u201cAs such, we will continue to implement and revise our response plan as necessary.\u201d",

      "Gauff, the 2023 U.S. Open champion and a semifinalist at Melbourne Park a year ago, went through a bit of a rough patch in the second set, struggling with double-faults and dropping four games in a row to go from a break up at 3-1 to a break down at 5-3.",
      "But when Burrage served for the second set, Gauff got back in control, using a four-game run of her own to end the contest.",
      "\u201cIt was tough. She was serving really well, so I was just trying to manage that, honestly,\u201d the No. 3-seeded Gauff said. \u201cShe really stepped her level up in the middle of the second set, so I was just trying to be offensive when I could.\u201d",
      "Gauff hit six of her seven double-faults in the second set, but was far steadier at the baseline overall, finishing the 1 1/2-hour match with 11 groundstroke unforced errors, compared to 37 for Burrage.",
      "Each of Burrage's final two service games ended with a double-fault; there were two in a row that made it 6-5.",
      "From there, Gauff finished the job as she continues to try to find improvements with her serve and forehand, two shots she has been focusing on since late last season.",

      "Being a private person from a small town is why Kim Caldwell keeps her business to herself",
      "Being a private person from a small town, Kim Caldwell keeps her business to herself.",
      "That's why she ducked and dodged questions for months about her first pregnancy.",
      "Then the woman who announced \u201cBaby Caldwell\u201d was on the way with a social media post Sept. 3 realized being the first-year coach of the historic Tennessee Lady Vols' women's basketball program allows her to help other working mothers not stress out or feel alone.",
      "\u201cI have an opportunity here to help the next person that is going to get pregnant during basketball season or anyone that\u2019s going to get pregnant during a time of their life that\u2019s stressful,\" Caldwell told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \u201cAnd for most women, that\u2019s all the time.\u201d",
      "Caldwell also is dealing with plenty of stress herself. The coach who turned 36 in November is due to give birth any day now with the 15th-ranked Lady Vols (14-2) in the meat of the Southeastern Conference schedule.",
      "It doesn't help Caldwell that those two losses came by a combined three points to teams ranked ins the Top 10 at tipoff.",
      "\u201cThose three points haunt me every day,\" Caldwell said. \"They haunt me in practice. They hopefully haunt our players of just how can we get those back? How can we improve? So we\u2019ve tried to tighten things up on them a little bit and learn from these losses.\u201d",
      "Athletic director Danny White went outside the Lady Vols' pipeline when hiring Caldwell last April as the third coach since Pat Summitt retired from the program she built along with barnstorming for women's basketball.",
      "Tennessee has yet to miss the NCAA Tournament that Summitt won eight times, and those banners hang above the court named for her with Summitt's statue across the street from the arena. Neither Holly Warlick nor Kellie Harper, who played for Summitt, could get the Lady Vols back to the Final Four.",
      "Caldwell took Marshall to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1997 last season. She arrived at Tennessee with a 217-31 career record with NCAA Tournament berths \u2014 seven at her alma mater Division II Glenville State where she won the 2022 national championship with two Final Four berths.",
      "Coaching at Tennessee? Not something Caldwell ever imagined.",
      "That's not stopping her from trying to win like she did in her previous stops while getting Tennessee back to where Lady Vols' fans expect.",
      "She's running the same style that worked at Glenville State and Marshall. That makes the Lady Vols tough to scout with their discombobulated, frantic attack up and down the court. Her players had to work hard once she arrived to be in condition ready to run for 40 minutes and more if needed.",
      "That tenacity helped Tennessee rally from 19 down in the third quarter before losing 87-86 to then-No. 9 Oklahoma on Jan. 5. A few days later the Lady Vols were down 18 to LSU before the Tigers had a last-second layup for an 89-87 win.",
      "Before the game, LSU coach Kim Mulkey gave Caldwell a gift bag filled with baby towels, lotion and a onesie following a tradition that the she has been doing since she was at Baylor because women\u2019s basketball needs more women coaching and being parents.",
      "Mulkey credited Summitt's own example as a mentor to her when Mulkey was an assistant coach still at Louisiana Tech. Summitt's son Tyler was born in September 1990.",
      "\u201c(She) basically mentored me and said, \u2018You can do this. Don\u2019t you get out of the business. You can have a baby and you can raise a child and you can be a great coach,\u2019\u201d Mulkey said of Summitt.",
      "The Lady Vols host Mississippi State (15-3) on Thursday night as part of the 13th annual \u201cWe Back Pat\u201d fundraiser in conjunction with the Pat Summitt Foundation and the Southeastern Conference. This game has a personal tie for Caldwell whose grandmother had Alzheimer\u2019s.",
      "Actually being mom and coach is still to come for Caldwell who has worn an oversized shirt, along with her assistants, all season to keep the attention focused on the Lady Vols. Whether Caldwell is having a boy or a girl remains private as well for now.",
      "She told reporters in Knoxville there is a plan in place for the Lady Vols when the baby arrives.",
      "Caldwell said only God knows when she gives birth or how quickly she is able to rejoin the Lady Vols this season. The SEC Tournament starts March 5 with the NCAA Tournament starting March 21 and 22 with Tennessee a possible host for the first weekend.",
      "\u201cGod willing ... I definitely have plans to return sooner than later,\u201d Caldwell said. \"But you just never know what is going to happen. And everyone has a different birth story. And so, again, you\u2019re kind of all prepared for everything.\u201d",

      "Jayden Daniels, meet Slinging Sammy Baugh.",
      "The Commanders' dynamic rookie quarterback accomplished a feat in his playoff debut that no quarterback in the NFL had done since Baugh during the franchise's first season in Washington back in 1937.",
      "Daniels threw two touchdown passes to lead the Commanders to a 23-20 win at Tampa Bay on Sunday night, joining Russell Wilson (2012), Mark Sanchez (2009) and Joe Flacco (2008) as the only rookie quarterbacks in the Super Bowl era to win a road playoff start.",
      "But Daniels did more than just win. He threw for 268 yards and led the team with 38 yards rushing, becoming the first rookie in NFL history to lead his team in yards rushing and passing in a playoff win. He also joined Baugh as the only rookie quarterbacks to throw at least two TD passes in a road playoff win, with Baugh throwing three in the 1937 NFL title game win against the Chicago Bears.",
      "Daniels' 13 wins in the regular season and playoffs are one shy of Ben Roethlisberger's rookie record set in 2004 for Pittsburgh, and he has engineered five fourth-quarter comebacks.",
      "Daniels has been at his best in the clutch, with his 117.3 passer rating when tied or down by eight points or fewer in the fourth quarter or overtime ranking No. 1 among 233 quarterbacks with at least 50 attempts in that situation since 1991.",
      "The Commanders also had their third game this season with Daniels at quarterback when they didn't punt the ball or commit a turnover. That had been done just twice before in the playoffs, with Josh Allen doing it for Buffalo against New England in the 2021 season and Hall of Famer Peyton Manning for Indianapolis against Kansas City in the 2003 season.",
      "The success that coach Dan Quinn has had in his first year as Washington's coach should provide some optimism to the seven teams that are changing coaches this offseason.",
      "Quinn took over a four-win team and guided the Commanders into the divisional round. Instant success like that is not unusual in the NFL, where high draft picks, easier schedules and typical regression to the mean make turnarounds very possible.",
      "Quinn is the ninth coach in the last 10 seasons to reach the divisional round in his first full season with a team, with the 2016 and 2021 seasons the only ones in that span that didn't feature at least one. In 2022, both the New York Giants with Brian Daboll and Jacksonville with Doug Pederson made it to the divisional round with first-year coaches.",
      "Three of those previous eight coaches made it to the conference title game, with Matt LaFleur losing his trip with Green Bay in 2019 and Doug Marrone losing for Jacksonville in 2017.",
      "Gary Kubiak won the Super Bowl in his first season in Denver in 2015, becoming the fourth coach to do that, following Tampa Bay's Jon Gruden (2002), San Francisco's George Seifert (1989) and Baltimore's Don McCafferty (1970).",
      "The AFC divisional round will have an oddly familiar look this season.",
      "For the second time, the four teams in the divisional round in a conference will be making repeat appearances with Kansas City, Buffalo, Baltimore and Houston all returning.",
      "The only difference will be the matchups, with the Chiefs hosting the Texans and Bills hosting the Ravens this year. Baltimore beat Houston in this round last year and Kansas City beat Buffalo.",
      "The only time this happened was in the AFC in 2011-12 when New England, Denver, Baltimore and Houston all made it in back-to-back years, with the Patriots and Ravens advancing both times.",
      "The NFC has only one repeat team in the divisional round, with Detroit back for a second straight season after not making it that far since 1991.",
      "Mike Tomlin and the Pittsburgh Steelers had another disappointing playoff appearance go one and done.",
      "The Steelers lost 28-14 to the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night for their sixth straight playoff loss, putting Tomlin in some rare coaching company.",
      "Tomlin is tied with Marty Schottenheimer, Jim Mora and Steve Owen for the second-longest postseason losing streak in NFL history, one loss shy of the seven-game skid Marvin Lewis had as Cincinnati's coach.",
      "The games haven't even been competitive most of the way since the streak started with a 36-17 loss to New England in the 2016 AFC title game.",
      "The Steelers have been outscored 73-0 in the first quarter of those losses and haven't had the ball with a lead once in any of those games. The only time they had a lead was in the 2021 wild-card game against Kansas City when T.J. Watt returned a fumble for a TD to open the scoring.",
      "The Chiefs scored a touchdown on the next drive and never trailed again on the way to a 42-21 win.",
      "The skid also includes a wild-card loss at Buffalo last season, a 48-37 loss at home in the 2020 wild-card round to Cleveland and a 45-42 loss at home to Jacksonville in the 2017 divisional round.",
      "Tomlin is the fourth coach since the merger to go at least eight straight seasons with one team without winning a playoff game. Lewis never won a playoff game in 16 seasons with the Bengals, Mora had no playoff wins in 11 seasons with New Orleans and Don Shula went eight straight seasons without a playoff win between Super Bowl appearances in the 1973 and 1982 seasons.",
      "The Houston defense has been causing quarterbacks problems all season.",
      "The Texans held Josh Allen to a 9-for-30 performance in Week 5, intercepted Jared Goff five times in Week 10 and then forced Justin Herbert into one of the worst games he has played.",
      "Herbert threw four interceptions in Saturday's loss to Houston \u2014 surpassing his 17-game regular-season total by one \u2014 for his most in any game in the NFL or college.",
      "The Texans got nine interceptions on 62 passes (14.5%) in the two games against Goff and Herbert while those two QBs threw just 10 on the other 1,013 passes (0.99%) they have thrown this season.",
      "The strong defensive effort sent the Texans to the divisional round for the second straight season with C.J. Stroud at quarterback. Stroud is the sixth QB ever to win playoff starts in each of his first two seasons, joining Brock Purdy, Russell Wilson, Mark Sanchez, Joe Flacco and Ben Roethlisberger.",

      "Pittsburgh Penguins star Evgeni Malkin says his struggling team needs to start playing harder if it wants to return to the playoffs",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Sitting in a quiet dressing room on Tuesday night after another blown lead turned into another crippling loss in a season increasingly filled with them, Evgeni Malkin spoke quietly.",
      "The Pittsburgh Penguins star has long served as the franchise's emotional core, the Russian's passion serving as the yin to longtime captain Sidney Crosby's more reserved yang.",
      "Malkin is well aware his historic partnership with Crosby and Kris Letang is nearing an end. The final chapter is not going the way the longest-tenured trio of teammates in major North American sports planned, particularly for Malkin, whose three Stanley Cup rings were reportedly stolen during a home invasion over the weekend.",
      "So after two periods of dominance against Seattle morphed into a 4-2 defeat to cap a maddening homestand in which the Penguins won just once in five tries \u2014 the lone victory against Connor McDavid and Edmonton \u2014 Malkin shook his head and gave a frank assessment of what is threatening to become another lost season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not good enough,\u201d he said. \"I hope we look in the mirror, tonight and tomorrow and start playing better.\u201d",
      "The All-Star break is a few weeks away, but time already feels like it's starting to run out. The Penguins begin a seven-game, 12-day road trip on Friday in Buffalo on the fringe of the playoff chase in the underwhelming Eastern Conference, the prospect of missing out on the postseason for a third straight year becoming all the more real with every defensive breakdown, every soft goal, every missed opportunity.",
      "\u201cWe see standings,\u201d said Malkin, who had an assist in his return from a four-game absence due to an upper-body injury. \u201cI think we understand we miss playoffs and it\u2019s half-season gone. We understand everything. (If) we want to play playoffs, we need to play so much better, every zone, every moment.\u201d",
      "Yet that kind of consistency has been elusive for most of the season save for a promising stretch between Thanksgiving and Christmas in which Pittsburgh clawed back into contention following a nightmarish opening six weeks.",
      "The optimism, however, has dimmed since the holiday break. Pittsburgh is just 2-5-3 over its last 10 to fall back under .500 after letting Seattle's Jamie Oleksiak and Eeli Tolvanen score 49 seconds apart in the third period to turn a 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 lead.",
      "Both goals highlighted the Penguins' erratic play in the defensive end. Oleksiak came onto the ice on a line change, took the puck at the top of the Pittsburgh zone and skated unchallenged down the slot before beating Tristan Jarry.",
      "Moments later, Tolvanen stood alone in front of the net to tap in a centering pass from Shane White to put the Kraken in front.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating,\u201d defenseman Marcus Pettersson said. \"We\u2019re giving away points. We have nobody to blame but ourselves.\u201d",
      "It's not that the Penguins can't defend. They held Tampa Bay to two shots in the first period on Sunday. They did the same to the Kraken just over 48 hours later. Both times, the opponents skated off with the win after breakdowns at critical times.",
      "\u201cIf I had the answer I\u2019d fix it,\u201d said Mike Sullivan, the NHL's second-longest tenured coach. \"We simply have to do a better job (in our end) and that falls on me.\u201d",
      "Malkin isn't sure he agrees. The Penguins were a playoff fixture during his first 16 seasons in the league and he has raised the Stanley Cup three times. During that era, a certain standard was set. Pittsburgh hasn't lived up to it for quite a while.",
      "\u201cI think everybody understands what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have nice organization. We have great history.\u201d",
      "All NHL dynasties end, though general manager Kyle Dubas said before the season began that he didn't think the Penguins needed to strip the franchise down \u201cto the studs\u201d to rebuild. He has injected some much-needed youth onto the roster, including trading for Philip Tomasino, who scored his fifth goal on Tuesday.",
      "Yet every step forward has been met with a step back. Goaltenders Jarry and Alex Nedeljkovic have shown a propensity to give up early goals. They've allowed opponents to score on their first shot nine times in 46 games, forcing Pittsburgh to play catchup too frequently.",
      "While Crosby in particular remains a marvel \u2014 he's on pace to average a point a game for what would be a record 20th straight season \u2014 the Penguins don't have the firepower that once came so easily. Their margin for error is smaller and they remain one of the league's oldest teams.",
      "Spending the next two weeks crisscrossing North America could give them a chance to steal away and hit the reset button. Or it could drop them into a hole so deep they could be essentially out of it by Groundhog Day. It could go either way. No one knows that more than Malkin.",
      "\u201cWe need to play so much harder,\u201d Malkin said.",
      "And do it quickly.",

      "Woods \u2014 who grew up in Southern California \u2014 said he knows \u201ca couple people that have lost everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just hard,\u201d Woods said.",
      "The PGA Tour has not announced any changes to its plans to play the Genesis, scheduled for Feb. 13-16. Riviera \u2014 the host site for golf at the 2028 Olympics \u2014 sits very close to areas that have been devastated by the fires. The course itself has not been directly affected.",
      "Woods' TGL teammate Max Homa \u2014 also a Southern California native \u2014 said the golf tournament's status should be far from anyone's mind right now.",
      "\u201cI know that these natural disasters happen far too often. However, this was the first one I can remember where every news clip, every time someone mentioned an area, I could picture it so well,\u201d Homa said. \u201cIt was very eerie. Fortunately, all my friends and family are safe. Houses not necessarily still all intact, but it was nice to be able to talk to quite a few people, and I think their perspective has been amazing about, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re safe, and that\u2019s what matters most.\u2019\u201d",
      "Tickets were still being sold Tuesday for the Genesis, though nobody knows what will happen over the next few weeks \u2014 or if it'll even be possible to play a tournament in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many other things that are bigger than that,\" Woods said. \u201cWe have subsequent meetings to try and figure all that out.\u201d",
      "Woods' Jupiter Links team lost 12-1 in its TGL opener to the Los Angeles Golf Club, and Collin Morikawa \u2014 part of the winning side Tuesday \u2014 said representing the city weighed heavily on him and teammates Justin Rose and Sahith Theegala.",
      "Fires burning homes and businesses in Los Angeles for a week have killed at least 25 people, displaced thousands and destroyed more than 12,000 buildings in what might be the most expensive set of conflagrations in the nation\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cYou think it's over, but it's not,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cWinds are picking up. Fires are still going. People are still out there, fighting the fires, protecting their houses, helping their neighbors, helping communities. That's why LA is, to me, such a great city. You see all the people coming together.\u201d",
      "Morikawa wore the \u201cLA Strong\u201d T-shirt that is being sold to raise money for fire relief efforts. Theegala, like Morikawa, has deep Southern California ties \u2014 he was born and raised in the area and went to college at Pepperdine. He said his caddie's sister lost her home in the fires.",
      "\u201cI was on Pepperdine\u2019s campus during the \u201918 Woolsey fire, and it just feels like an ongoing thing the last six, seven years. There\u2019s no slowing down,\u201d Theegala said. \u201cBefore that first fire happened, it didn\u2019t feel real at all. You see fires happening, houses being burned down, people\u2019s lives being destroyed, and when you see it right in front of your eyes, it\u2019s as real as it gets and it\u2019s scarier than any media portrayal. It\u2019s scarier than anything that\u2019s being described.\u201d",
      "Morikawa said he took pride in being able to give people in Los Angeles a distraction for a couple hours, like the Los Angeles Rams did in their NFC wild-card playoff win on Monday night \u2014 a game that was relocated to Arizona because of the fires.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re probably the newest team in LA, but to get back-to-back wins with the Rams and then us ... you laugh at that, I know,\u201d Morikawa said. \u201cBut look, we don\u2019t take this lightly.\u201d",

      "Tiger Woods was the sixth and final player to emerge from the tunnel and onto the field of play for his TGL debut",
      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Tiger Woods was the sixth and final player to emerge from the tunnel and onto the field of play for his TGL debut on Tuesday night.",
      "No one announced his name. Wasn't necessary.",
      "Survivor's \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d blared and that was more than enough of an introduction for perhaps golf's greatest player ever. It's not like anyone inside SoFi Center at Palm Beach State College didn't know who Woods was, and most were even probably aware of how he, Rory McIlroy and others spent years trying to make this notion of indoor golf on TV happen.",
      "\u201cIt is a reality now,\u201d Woods said.",
      "Week 2 of TGL was Tuesday night \u2014 Woods joined Kevin Kisner and Max Homa of Jupiter Links Golf Club to take on the Los Angeles Golf Club of Justin Rose, Collin Morikawa and Sahith Theegala.",
      "The final score: Los Angeles 12, Jupiter 1 in the 15-hole, made-for-TV team match featuring nine holes of alternate shot triples play, followed by six holes of singles play \u2014 two holes for each player on each team. Woods was smiling throughout, even with the lopsided score. The format is such that he only took 20 shots over the course of the match, which lasted just over two hours.",
      "\u201cWe were entertaining,\" Woods said, still laughing even after the rout ended inside the arena built just a few miles from his Jupiter Island home. \u201cWe hit a lot of shots. I think the people there got to see how bad pros can be. It was just a boat race, oh my goodness. But we had a great time.\u201d",
      "Woods' team got on the wrong side of the scoreboard quickly, falling behind 5-0. It could have been worse if Woods hadn't made an 8-footer for par to help his team get a tie on the fifth hole. That putt came one hole after Woods slid a 7-footer wide to the left.",
      "\u201cIt's about time, Tiger,\u201d tennis legend Serena Williams said on the ESPN broadcast. Williams is a longtime friend of Woods, so she found herself rooting for him \u2014 and she is part of the ownership group of the Los Angeles Golf Club, so she found herself simultaneously rooting against him.",
      "There were vintage Woods moments, like staring down shots he liked as the super-high-tech video boards told the tale of where the ball would have gone outdoors. There were also frustrating ones; he shook his head after he sent a 101-yard wedge into the water on the second hole of the 15-hole match \u2014 as son Charlie, sitting in one of the seats in the arena overlooking the course, couldn't help but laugh.",
      "\u201cThis is unique. This is something that golf has never seen before,\" Woods said. \u201cYou have an arena like this and you out there with great guys, entertain everyone, just have fun.\"",
      "It wasn't just Charlie Woods chuckling at Jupiter Links' play. Tiger Woods was as well \u2014 especially when Kisner bladed a shot from the sand, sent it ricocheting off the pin as his teammates ducked for cover.",
      "\u201cWe honestly didn't think that anyone could possibly get hit in here,\u201d Woods said.",
      "The golf might be a hit. Woods was hoping viewers watched until the end; Homa suggested that Duke fans would still be watching, since the Blue Devils were playing Miami on ESPN after the golf ended. And Woods, who walked with his son in a tournament last month, looked like he was physically sound \u2014 at least in the sense that he didn't seem to be holding anything back while swinging.",
      "Physically, he said he felt fine. As far as the golf: \u201cThe walking's not the issue. My game's not any good,\" Woods said.",
      "Williams sat in the Los Angeles box just to the right of the players' teeing areas, enjoying the spectacle of the walk-out introductions, light and smoke shows and booming music.",
      "\u201cIt's so wild,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt's something that you see a little bit in tennis. We see it all the time in basketball, right? We don't really see it so much in golf. Actually, we never see that in golf. It's so good to kind of see their personalities and see them shine as golfers. ... It's so cool to see a new aspect.\u201d",

      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery in southern Britain shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage",
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\u201cThat was really jaw-dropping \u2013 it\u2019s never been observed before in European prehistory,\u201d said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2013 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cit\u2019s your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife\u2019s family for land and livelihood,\u201d said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2013 called matrilocality \u2013 is historically rare.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2013 women leaving their homes to join their husband\u2019s family group \u2013 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives\u2019 extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2013 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2013 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain\u2019s Celtic society \u201cmore egalitarian than the Roman world,\u201d said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",

      "A nonprofit research lab is getting attention from some wealthy tech philanthropists",
      "MONTREAL -- Peeps trickle out of a soundproof chamber as its door opens. Female zebra finches are chattering away inside the microphone-lined box. The laboratory room sounds like a chorus of squeaky toys.",
      "\u201cThey're probably talking about us a little bit,\u201d says McGill University postdoctoral fellow Logan James.",
      "It's unclear, of course, what they are saying. But James believes he is getting closer to deciphering their vocalizations through a partnership with the Earth Species Project. The nonprofit laboratory has drawn some of the technology industry's wealthiest philanthropists \u2014 and they want to see more than just scientific progress. On top of breakthroughs in animal language, they expect improved interspecies understanding will foster greater appreciation for the planet in the face of climate change.",
      "The Earth Species Project hopes to decode other creatures' communications with its pioneering artificial intelligence tools. The goal is not to build a \u201ctranslator that will allow us to speak to other species,\u201d Director of Impact Jane Lawton said. However, she added, \u201crudimentary dictionaries\u201d for other animals are not only possible but could help craft better conservation strategies and reconnect humanity with often forgotten ecosystems.",
      "\u201cWe believe that by reminding people of the beauty, the sophistication, the intelligence that is resident in other species and in nature as a whole, we can start to, kind of, almost repair that relationship,\" Lawton said.",
      "At McGill University, the technology generates specific calls during simulated conversations with live finches that help researchers isolate each unique noise. The computer processes calls in real time and responds with one of its own. Those recordings are then used to train the Berkeley, California-based research group\u2019s audio language model for animal sounds.",
      "This ad hoc collaboration is only a glimpse into what ESP says will come. By 2030, Lawton said, it expects \u201creally interesting insights into how other animals communicate.\u201d Artificial intelligence advancements are expediting the research. New grants totaling $17 million will help hire engineers and at least double the size of the research team, which currently has roughly seven members. Over the next two years, Lawton said, the nonprofit's researchers will select species that \u201cmight actually shift something\u201d in people's relationship with nature.",
      "Standing to benefit are animal groups threatened by habitat loss or human activity that could be better protected with better understandings of their languages. Existing collaborations aim to document the vocal repertoires \u2014 the distinct calls and their different contexts \u2014 of the Hawaiian crow and St. Lawrence River beluga whales.",
      "After spending more than two decades extinct in the wild, the crows have been reintroduced to their home of Maui. But some conservationists fear that critical vocabulary has faded in captivity. Lawton said the birds might need to relearn some \u201cwords\u201d before they reenter their natural habitat in droves.",
      "In Canada's St. Lawrence River, where shipping traffic imperils the marine mammals who feed there, the group's scientists are exploring whether machine learning can categorize unlabeled calls from the remaining belugas. Perhaps, Lawton suggested, authorities could alert nearby vessels if they understood that certain sounds signaled the whales were about to surface.",
      "Big donors include LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, the family charity founded by late Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen and Laurene Powell Jobs\u2019 Waverley Street Foundation. The latter aims to support \u201cbottom-up\u201d solutions to the \u201cclimate emergency.\u201d At the root of that crisis, according to Waverley Street Foundation President Jared Blumenfeld, is the idea that humans deserve \u201cdominion\u201d over the world.",
      "Blumenfeld finds that ESP's work is an important reminder that we are instead stewards of the planet.",
      "\"This is not a silver bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s certainly part of a suite of things that can help transform how we view ourselves in relation to nature.\u201d",
      "Gail Patricelli -- an unaffiliated animal behavior professor at the University of California, Davis -- remembers when such tools were just \u201cpie in the sky.\u201d Researchers previously spent months laboring to manually comb through terabytes of recordings and annotate calls.",
      "She said she's seen an \u201cexponential takeoff\u201d the past few years in bioacoustics' use of machine learning to accelerate that process. While she finds that ESP has the promise to make finer distinctions in existing \u201cdictionaries,\u201d especially for harder-to-reach species, she cautioned observers against attributing human characteristics to these animals.",
      "Considering this research\u2019s high equipment and labor costs, Patricelli said she\u2019s happy to see big philanthropists backing it. But she said the field shouldn\u2019t rely too much on one funding source. Government support is still necessary, she noted, because ecosystem protection also requires that conservationists examine \u201cunsexy\u201d species that she expects get less attention than more charismatic ones. She also encouraged funders to consult scientists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot to learn and it\u2019s very expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cThat might not be a big deal to some of these donors but it\u2019s very hard to come up with the money to do this.\u201d",
      "The current work largely involves developing baseline technologies to do all this. A separate initiative has recently described the basic elements of how sperm whales might talk. But ESP is trying to be \u201cspecies agnostic,\u201d AI Research Director Olivier Pietquin said, to provide tools that can sort out many animals\u2019 speech patterns.",
      "ESP introduced NatureLM-audio this fall, touting the system as the first large audio-language model fit for animals. The tool can identify species and distinguish characteristics such as sex or stage of life. When applied to a population \u2014 zebra finches \u2014 it had not been trained on, NatureLM-audio accurately counted the number of birds at a rate higher than random chance, according to ESP. The results were a positive sign for Pietquin that NatureLM might be able to scale across species.",
      "\u201cThat is only possible with a lot of computing, a lot of data and many, many collaborations with ecologists and biologists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, I think, makes us, makes it, quite serious.\u201d",
      "ESP acknowledges that it isn\u2019t sure what will be discovered about animal communications and won\u2019t know when its model gets it absolutely right. But the team likens AI to the microscope: advancements that allowed scientists to see far more than previously considered possible.",
      "Zebra finches are highly social animals with large call repertoires. Whether congregating in pairs or by the hundreds, they produce hours of data \u2014 a help to the nonprofit's AI scientists given that animal sounds aren't as abundant as the pages of internet text scraped to train chatbots.",
      "James, an affiliated researcher with the Earth Species Project, struggles with the concept of decoding animal communications. Sure, he can clearly distinguish when a chick is screaming for food. But he doesn\u2019t expect to ever translate that call or any others into a human word.",
      "Still, he wonders if he can gather more hints about their interactions from aspects of the call such as its pitch or duration.",
      "\u201cSo can we find a link between a form and function is sort of our way of maybe thinking about decoding,\" James said. \u201cAs she elongates her call, is that because she\u2019s trying harder to elicit a response?\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- In a two-for-one moonshot, SpaceX launched a pair of lunar landers Wednesday for U.S. and Japanese companies looking to jumpstart business on Earth\u2019s dusty sidekick.",
      "The two landers rocketed away in the middle of the night from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, the latest in a stream of private spacecraft aiming for the moon. They shared the ride to save money but parted company an hour into the flight exactly as planned, taking separate roundabout routes for the monthslong journey.",
      "It\u2019s take 2 for the Tokyo-based ispace, whose first lander crashed into the moon two years ago. This time, it has a rover on board with a scoop to gather up lunar dirt for study and plans to test potential food and water sources for future explorers.",
      "Lunar newcomer Texas-based Firefly Aerospace is flying 10 experiments for NASA, including a vacuum to gather dirt, a drill to measure the temperature below the surface and a device that could be used by future moonwalkers to keep the sharp, abrasive particles off their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a species of U.S. Southeastern fireflies \u2014 should reach the moon first. The 6-foot-6-inches-tall (2-meter-tall) lander will attempt a touchdown in early March at Mare Crisium, a volcanic plain in the northern latitudes.",
      "The slightly bigger ispace lander named Resilience will take four to five months to get there, targeting a touchdown in late May or early June at Mare Frigoris, even farther north on the moon\u2019s near side.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t think this is a race. Some people say \u2018race to the moon,\u2019 but it\u2019s not about the speed,\u201d ispace\u2019s founder CEO Takeshi Hakamada said this week from Cape Canaveral.",
      "Both Hakamada and Firefly CEO Jason Kim acknowledge the challenges still ahead, given the wreckage littering the lunar landscape. Only five countries have successfully placed spacecraft on the moon since the 1960s: the former Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done everything we can on the design and the engineering,\u201d Kim said. Even so, he pinned an Irish shamrock to his jacket lapel Tuesday night for good luck.",
      "The U.S. remains the only one to have landed astronauts. NASA\u2019s Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, aims to get astronauts back on the moon by the end of the decade.",
      "Before that can happen, \u201cwe\u2019re sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\u201d NASA's science mission chief Nicky Fox said on the eve of launch.",
      "If acing their respective touchdowns, both spacecraft will spend two weeks operating in constant daylight, shutting down once darkness hits.",
      "Once lowered onto the lunar surface, ispace\u2019s 11-pound (5-kilogram) rover will stay near the lander, traveling up to hundreds of yards (meters) in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. The rover has its own special delivery to drop off on the lunar dust: a toy-size red house designed by a Swedish artist.",
      "NASA is paying $101 million to Firefly for the mission and another $44 million for the experiments. Hakamada declined to divulge the cost of ispace\u2019s rebooted mission with six experiments, saying it's less than the first mission that topped $100 million.",
      "Coming up by the end of February is the second moonshot for NASA by Houston-based Intuitive Machines. Last year, the company achieved the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more than a half-century, landing sideways near the south pole but still managing to operate.",

      "With a possible TikTok ban just days away, many U.S. users are looking for alternative social media platforms to help them keep up with pop culture or provide the type of entertaining videos that popularized the short-form video app.",
      "TikTok, which has been a cultural phenomenon, could be banned on Jan. 19 under a law that forces the platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or shut down its U.S. operation.",
      "The fate of social media platform will be decided by the Supreme Court, which last week heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute and seemed likely to uphold the law. The court could rule on the case as soon as this week. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump has asked the justices to put the law on hold so he can negotiate a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue after he takes office.",
      "TikTok has more than 170 million users in the U.S., and if it does get banned, it\u2019s not clear which competitors will benefit the most. Some experts think established social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, could see the biggest influx of users. But some users are looking for something different and could turn to other apps.",
      "Here are the different alternatives and what to know about them:",
      "Recently, some U.S. TikTok users have flocked to the Chinese social media app Xiaohongshu in protest of the looming ban. Like TikTok, Xiaohongshu, which in English means \u201cLittle Red Book,\u201d combines e-commerce and short-form videos.",
      "The app has gained traction in China and other regions with a Chinese diaspora \u2014 such as Malaysia and Taiwan \u2014 racking up 300 million monthly active users, a majority of whom are young women who use it as a de-facto search engine for product, travel and restaurant recommendations, as well as makeup and skincare tutorials.",
      "On Tuesday, the Xiaohongshu, called \u201cRedNote\u201d by American users and on some app stores, was the top downloaded free app in Apple\u2019s U.S. app store.",
      "Lemon8, also owned by TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance, is a lesser-known lifestyle app that allows users to post pictures and short-form videos. Though the platform lets users post TikTok-like videos, it leans more into pictures and has been described as a mixture of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "In the past few weeks, many creators have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also recommended it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, indicating a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But the law that targets TikTok also states the divest-or-ban requirement for ByteDance applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by the two companies or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 is not explicitly named in the statute, its future in the U.S. is also in jeopardy.",
      "Instagram launched Reels in 2020, a TikTok-like feed of short videos users can create or scroll through. The feature has proven to be massively popular and some experts say creators are likely to set up shop there if a TikTok ban does happen. As of 2022, Instagram had 2 billion active monthly users. Meta no longer discloses user numbers for its individual platforms.",
      "But could it replace TikTok? That depends. While many creators currently post on both platforms, some experts say the youngest users are unlikely to migrate to a service made popular by their millennial parents. And while Meta\u2019s algorithm is addictive, it\u2019s still not TikTok.",
      "In the past, some TikTok users have also blamed the surge of scrutiny on the platform on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pointing to a Washington Post report from 2022 that said the tech behemoth paid a Republican consulting firm to undermine TikTok through a nationwide media and lobbying campaign.",
      "Though TikTok dominates headlines as a driver of internet trends, Pew Research Center says YouTube is actually the most widely-used platform among teens and adults.",
      "YouTube users can scroll through Shorts just as they can on TikTok or Reels on Instagram and Facebook, allowing them to watch hours of bite-sized videos. Many of the videos featured on YouTube are from TikTok or creators who post to several platforms. That said, YouTube is still known for its longer-format videos so it may not have the variety of content that TikTok users are looking for \u2014 at least not yet.",
      "Snapchat, launched in 2011 with its infamous disappearing videos, remains popular among teens and younger adults. The platform gained so much traction that Meta designed a similar feature in Facebook and Instagram called \u201cStories\u201d that lets users post photos or videos that disappear within 24 hours. In 2020, Snapchat launched another feature that lets users \u201cshine a light on the most entertaining Snaps, no matter who created them.\u201d",
      "The platform is estimated to have roughly 692 million global monthly active users last year, according to eMarketer.",
      "For TikTok users who enjoy the \u201cTikTok Live\u201d feed that features livestreamed videos, Twitch could be a good alternative. The Amazon-owned platform is a leader in the streaming industry and allows users on the platform to watch some of the internet\u2019s most popular streamers, such as Kai Cenat. Twitch says it has 105 million monthly visitors.",
      "Clapper, a TikTok clone, has also been gaining some traction amid the looming ban. The app was launched in 2020 by Dallas-based entrepreneur Edison Chen, and focuses on Gen X and millennial users. In September of that year, the company described itself in a Facebook post as a \u201cfree speech\u201d platform that did not \u201ccensor posts and comments.\u201d But in blog post on its website from 2021, the company wrote it \u201cstopped being a \u2018Free Speech\u2019 platform\u201d in September 2020 and \u201cchanged its mission and goals\u201d to focus on \u201ccommunity\u201d.",
      "For TikTok users who want to get away from the overcrowded spots, there are lesser-known apps like Triller, which is popular for music videos, and Zigazoo, which was designed with kids in mind.",
      "If none of these apps tickle your fancy, it's also possible that other platforms could emerge in the next few months as companies attempt to attract users looking for a new place to go."

      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations",
      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on Monday signed a bill restricting the use of smartphones at school, following a global trend for such limitations.",
      "The move will impact students at elementary and high schools across the South American nation starting in February. It provides a legal framework to ensure students only use such devices in cases of emergency and danger, for educational purposes, or if they have disabilities and require them.",
      "\"We cannot allow humanism to be replaced by algorithms,\u201d Lula said in a closed ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital, Brasilia, adding that the bill \u201cacknowledges the work of every serious person in education, everyone who wants to take care of children and teenagers in this country.\u201d",
      "In May, Fundacao Getulio Vargas, a leading think-tank and university, said Brazil had more smartphones than people, with 258 million devices for a population of 203 million Brazilians. Local market researchers said last year that Brazilians spend 9 hours and 13 minutes per day on screens, one of the world's highest figures.",
      "Education minister Camilo Santana told journalists that children are going online at early ages, making it harder for parents to keep track of what they do, and that restricting smartphones at school will help them.",
      "The bill had rare support across the political spectrum, both from allies of leftist Lula and his far-right foe, former President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "Many parents and students also approved the move. A survey released in October by Brazilian pollster Datafolha said that almost two-thirds of respondents supported banning the use of smartphones by children and teenagers at schools. More than three-quarters said those devices do more harm than good to their children.",
      "\u201c(Restricting cell phones) is tough, but necessary. It is useful for them to do searches for school, but to use it socially isn't good,\u201d said Ricardo Martins Ramos, 43, father of two girls and the owner of a hamburger restaurant in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cKids will interact more.\u201d",
      "His 13-year-old daughter Isabela said her classmates struggled to focus during class because of their smartphones. She approved the move, but doesn't see it as enough to improve the learning environment for everyone.",
      "\"When the teacher lets you use the cell phone, it is because he wants you to do searches,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's still a lot of things that schools can't solve, such as bullying and harassment.\u201d",
      "As of 2023, about two-thirds of Brazilian schools imposed some restriction on cellphone use, while 28% banned them entirely, according to a survey released in August by the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.",
      "The Brazilian states of Rio de Janeiro, Maranhao and Goias have already passed local bills to ban such devices at schools. However, authorities have struggled to enforce these laws.",
      "Authorities in Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil, are discussing whether smartphones should be banned both in public and private schools.",
      "Gabriele Alexandra Henriques Pinheiro, 25, works at a beauty parlor and is the mother of a boy diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. She also agrees with the restrictions, but says adults will continue to be a bad example of smartphone use for children.",
      "\u201cIt is tough,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to restrict the time my son watches any screens, but whenever I have a task to perform I have to use the smartphone to be able to do it all,\u201d she said.",
      "Institutions, governments, parents and others have for years associated smartphone use by children with bullying, suicidal ideation, anxiety and loss of concentration necessary for learning. China moved last year to limit children\u2019s use of smartphones, while France has in place a ban on smartphones in schools for kids aged six to 15.",
      "Cell phone bans have gained traction across the United States, where eight states have passed laws or policies that ban or restrict cellphone use to try to curb student phone access and minimize distractions in classrooms.",
      "An increasing number of parents across Europe who are concerned by evidence that smartphone use among young kids jeopardizes their safety and mental health.",
      "A report published in September by UNESCO, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, said one in four countries has already restricted the use of such devices at schools.",
      "Last year in a U.S. Senate hearing, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized to parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media. He also noted Meta\u2019s continued investments in \u201cindustrywide\u201d efforts to protect children.",

      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old.

      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",

      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "Automakers pulled out all the stops to showcase their latest advances for in-vehicle experiences at CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all things tech, in Las Vegas this week. Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company shows the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",
      "Car safety experts have long stressed that keeping drivers' eyes on the road is critical. Simplicity is also key, says Ian Reagan, a senior research scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an education and research nonprofit. Too many visual display features can be overwhelming, he explains.",

Still, Reagan says he's encouraged by recent developments in panoramic displays that aim to keep key, minimal information in a car's line of sight.",
      "Beyond Hyundai Mobis, that's part of what BMW, which showed off its new Panoramic iDrive and Operating System X, also says it's trying to do. The system, which will be integrated into of new models starting later this year, projects a panoramic display onto the vehicles' lower windscreen.",
      "The technology offers a range of digital features and can be personalized by different colors, apps and other preferences. But in the driver's line of sight, Stephan Durach, BMW\u2019s Head of UI/UX Development, said the goal was to avoid redundancies.",
      "\u201cYou often hear the phrase, \u2018your car is your smartphone on wheels.\u2019 And to be honest, I don\u2019t like this at all,\u201d Durach told The Associated Press. He said that the display aims to show a minimal amount of the most important information above the dashboard, in efforts to help reduce distractions.",
      "Honda and Sony Honda Mobility also spotlighted in-cabin features that drivers will soon encounter in their new EV lineup.",
      "Sony Honda Mobility says \u201cAfeela 1\" will include an interactive AI-powered voice agent. In Monday's remarks, CEO Yasuhide Mizuno said that \u201ccustomers can be entertained by communicating with Afeela 1\u201d \u2014 noting that Afeela's agent is \u201cfocused on conversation\u201d and \u201cproactively talks to you\u201d to provide useful information as you drive.",
      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",
      "Meanwhile, Honda spotlighted \u201cultra-personal optimization\u201d for customers of its upcoming 0 series of electric vehicles \u2014 the first two models of which are set to launch in North America next year. The Japanese car giant unveiled the operating system that it plans to use in all 0 series models, \u201cAISMO OS,\u201d which it says will be integrated into vehicle operations ranging from automated driving and advanced driver assistance to in-car infotainment.",
      "In-vehicle software functions will also continue to be updated after purchase. \u201cThe more it is used, the more personalized it will become,\u201d Katsushi Inoue, global head of electrification business development at Honda, said in Tuesday remarks.",
      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, there are still questions about the safety and efficacy of new features.",
      "Reagan points to AI-powered voice agents and the growing buzz around partial automated driving. He says his team's research shows that people interacting with partially-automated driving are \u201cmore distracted than ever\u201d because drivers have to \u201calways be ready\u201d for changes in vehicle assistance.",
      "And while AI voice assistants bring promising solutions to keeping drivers' eyes on the road, Reagan notes that they're not all built equally. How they are implemented is key, he said, noting that if a voice assistant requires too much back and forth or complicated answers it can also lead to frustration and distraction.",
      "Beyond in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week highlighted the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand charging sources for consumers. Honda has a venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America and said Tuesday it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road. The company said it's considering incorporating AI technology from Amazon Web Services to help individuals find nearby charging facilities, for example, or simplify payments.",

      "Los Angeles County is battling wildfires across 45 square miles of the densely populated county, leaving thousands of structures damages, thousands of residents displaced and at least 25 people dead.",
      "The destruction has also impacted decades of progress for other communities of color in the region who settled in Altadena, which is now 41% white, 27% Hispanic, 18% Black and 17% multiracial.",
      "In the 1960s, a combination of urban renewal, white flight and the political movements of the time caused rapid demographic shifts in the Altadena region, according to Altadena Heritage.",
      "The end of widespread discriminatory redlining practices made Altadena a place where Black, Hispanic and Indigenous residents looking for a home could find a bargain.",
      "The town became home to several iconic Black figures, including Sidney Poitier, the first Black actor to win an Oscar, prominent author Octavia Butler, artist Charles White, abolitionist Ellen Garrison Jackson Clark and others.",
      "Veronica Jones, president of the Altadena Historical Society, says Altadena offered \"more opportunities away from what the city [of Pasadena] offered children of color at that time.\"",
      "Many of those who lost homes in the fire are from families that have been in Altadena for generations.",
      "One of those residents is Kim Jones. For Jones, Altadena has been her family's home for four generations; she says her family moved to Altadena due to racism and segregation in the South in the '60s.",
      "Jones says speaking about the heartbreak of losing everything is her attempt to be \"the family historian\" now that the material memories are gone.",
      "She said her grandmother, who had a home on Lincoln Avenue, was one of the first Black families in the neighborhood.",
      "Kendall Jones, Kim's son, lost memories of his father, who passed away two years ago, in the blaze.",
      "\"Part of me is devastated that all that is gone and the memories of him, but at the same time, I'm also hopeful that my family can rebuild and move past this because no matter what, we're still alive and no one got hurt, and that's the most important thing,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Kim Jones said her 52 years of memories were in the house \u2013 \"I have pictures from my childhood. Kendall has pictures. My mother had a tiny cabinet and dishes that were her grandmother's. Jewelry. I had photos from my grandmother, who had lived with them before she passed.\"",
      "Earnestine Brown-Turner also lost her home in the blaze. She had evacuated to her daughter's Los Angeles home, which is in an evacuation warning zone. When Brown-Turner was packing to evacuate, she took little with her and expected to return with her home intact.",
      "When she and her family came back, everything was gone: \"We kind of still had the hope as we were driving up the neighborhood, but there was no neighborhood left,\" said Imani Brown-Turner.",
      "The Brown-Turner family had memories from enslaved family members, including quilts and photos. Those are all gone.",
      "As residents process the grief of losing everything they had, concerns about the future hang heavy over their heads. The region had already been experiencing signs of gentrification ahead of the destructive blaze.",
      "Veronica Jones noted that the homes in Altadena now sell for hefty price tags, as Altadena becomes a desired area for new residents at the base of the beautiful San Gabriel mountains.",
      "\"The area is starting to be revitalized again,\" said Kim Jones. \"We want to come back. We want to come back and rebuild.\"",
      "As families prepare to rebuild their homes from scratch, she fears some residents will be preyed upon for quick sales of their land: \"But there's no quick sale. There's no quick sale because California is expensive to live in. I want my family home to be a family home for the next generation and the generation after that.\"",

      "Firefighters battle disastrous flames across 45 square miles.",
      "While raging flames, persistent smoke and damaging winds continue to plague residents in Los Angeles County, farmers across Southern California are also facing the possibility of devastating damage to their crops.",
      "Julia Zorthian and her family have lived and worked at Zorthian Ranch in Altadena, California, since her grandfather purchased the property in the 1940s. The land has hosted summer camps, taught people how to milk goats and grew citrus and nut trees. But after the Eaton Fire devastated their community, 39 of the farm's 40 acres have been destroyed --\u00a0leaving the family without a livelihood or a place to call home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much crazier than anyone could have ever imagined the fire could be,\" Zorthian told ABC News. \"The places we thought would be safe spaces to keep things that probably wouldn\u2019t get damaged ended up incinerating.\u201d",
      "Alba Velasquez, the executive director of the Los Angeles Food Policy Council, told ABC News that farmers face two hurdles, namely economic and air quality challenges.",
      "\u201cOur farmers are our backbone of our local food system, and these fires remind us how fragile that system can be,\u201d Velasquez said.",
      "Currently, Velsquez said there are about 24 farms that are affected by the Eaton Fire, with numbers increasing every day. Velasquez said that could include issues with air quality, flames, smoke or just economic impacts.",
      "For families like Zorthian's, the only option is to start over.",
      "\u201cWe will rebuild, but it will never be what it was,\" Zorthian said. \"That was about 80 years of work and artistry.\u201d",
      "Peter Ansel, director of policy advocacy at the California Farmers Bureau, told ABC News that the smoke poses a particular threat, including \u201cto people, animals on ranches or on the end-products themselves.\u201d In 2020, smoke from nearby wildfires ruined crops at vineyards in Wine Country.",
      "Others who are not facing the smoke or flames are still struggling to sell their goods, since many farmers markets in Los Angeles County are shut down or receiving a limited amount of visitors.",
      "Craig Underwood, owner of Underwood Family Farms in Moorpark, California, said dangerous conditions prevented the crew from attending the Brentwood market and poor air quality resulted in few visitors at the Pasadena market -- drastically diminishing their sales.",
      "\u201cThere will be long-term economic impacts,\u201d Underwood told ABC News. \u201cWe count on those farmers markets for selling a lot of those produce.\u201d",
      "The damaging winds from the past week have led to several power outages on Underwood\u2019s farm and has increased the risk of scarring their lemons. Until the gusts diminish, the farm will be closed.",
      "\u201cRight now, the lemon market is not that strong, so to have our quality degraded really hurts,\u201d Underwood said. \u201cFruits and vegetables sell by appearance as much as anything else.\u201d",
      "While large fires haven't broken out farther south in San Diego County, abnormally strong winds are still wreaking havoc on farms.",
      "Andy Lyall, a fourth-generation citrus and avocado grower in Pauma Valley, California, north of San Diego, is part of a tight-knit, family business that goes back to 1933. Lyall told ABC News he is accustomed to strong gusts, but the violent Santa Ana winds fanning the recent California wildfires were completely unexpected.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gotten through a lot of winds, but this one just hammered us,\u201d Lyall said.",
      "These disastrous winds, which swirled through Lyall\u2019s avocado trees, destroyed about 50% of his crops, he said. Avocados are the fourth-largest crop in the area, according to the San Diego County Farm Bureau. But Lyall said the destruction from these winds will ultimately change those numbers.",
      "\u201cThis really will hurt the supply of avocados,\u201d Lyall said. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant crop that we grow in our county and this is definitely going to impact the supply of safe, locally produced produce that will be in the stores this upcoming spring and summer.\u201d",
      "Along with Lyall, many farmers are experiencing direct and indirect impacts from these continuous flames.",
      "The California Department of Food and Agriculture recommends farmers who have experienced crop loss to look into their Noninsured Disaster Assistance Program, which \u201dpays covered producers of covered noninsurable crops when low yields, loss of inventory, or prevented planting occur due to natural disasters,\u201d according to the website. The Los Angeles Food Policy Council and the Community Alliance with Family Farmers also provide post-wildlife recovery resources.",
      "When farmers are limited on resources, missing market events or losing everything they own, Velasquez said community members will be less likely to find produce locally, and will instead rely on big-box grocery stores.",

      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has issued an executive order to rebuild homes and businesses that the city lost in the ongoing LA County fires that overall have so far burned more than 40,000 acres and destroyed more than 12,000 structures",
      "The executive order calls for city agencies to expedite temporary occupancy approvals for 1,400 housing units that are near completion, and the establishment of a \"Debris Removal Task Force\" and \"Watershed Hazards Task Force\" to respectively develop plans for debris removal and mitigate the risks and dangers of post-fire flash floods, mudslides and debris flows.",
      "The order also calls for city agencies to collectively expedite the building permit review process, calling for reviews to be done in 30 days following the submission of an application. Inspections by the Department of Building and Safety are to be conducted in two business days of a submitted request, according to the order.",
      "For structures being rebuilt, city agencies will be required to process necessary clearances and releases related to building permit applications and certificates of occupancy within five business days, the order states.",
      "The order notes that eligible rebuilds under these requirements must be rebuilt at the same location where they previously existed, used for the same use as the previous structure and are not to exceed 110% of the floor area, height, and bulk of the previous structure.",
      "\u201cThis unprecedented natural disaster warrants an unprecedented response that will expedite the rebuilding of homes, businesses and communities,\u201d Bass said in a statement. \u201cThis order is the first step in clearing away red tape and bureaucracy to organize around urgency, common sense and compassion. We will do everything we can to get Angelenos back home.\u201d",
      "Bass received criticism for being away from the city on a planned diplomatic trip to Ghana when the Palisades Fire first erupted and has been hit by critics for her leadership, particularly from her 2022 Republican mayoral opponent Rick Caruso who claimed Bass was \"abandoning her post\" during the tragedy in an interview with Politico.",
      "Bass, who posted a warning about the windstorm on social media ahead of the wildfires, told reporters Wednesday, Jan. 8, the day after the fire started, that she took the \"fastest route back, which included being on a military plane.\"",
      "The wildfires have been predicted by financial analysts to \"be the costliest wildfire event in California history,\" with Goldman Sachs estimating total losses at $40 billion.",
      "With families displaced across the county, the wildfires have put pressure on communities already facing housing crises. California, and specifically Los Angeles County, has some of the highest rent and home costs in the country, according to the California Legislative Analyst's Office, with mid-tier homes priced more than twice as high as an average mid-tier home in the United States.",
      "According to Apartments.com, renters also face challenges: the average rent in Los Angeles is 39% higher than the national average rent, the real estate research organization states.",
      "High housing and living costs are highlighted by the state's troubles tackling homelessness, with more homeless residents than any other state.",
      "According to the U.S. Office of Housing and Urban Development, the availability of housing for individuals and families experiencing homelessness in the area led to a decline in homelessness for the first time in 7 years.",
      "Los Angeles County\u2019s point-in-time estimate of homelessness declined by 0.27%, while the city estimated a decline of 2.2%. The unsheltered homeless population decreased by larger margins, with the county decreasing it by 5.1% and the city decreasing it by 10.4%.",
      "Addressing homelessness and the lack of affordable housing in the region was a key piece of Bass' campaign, though not without controversy and hurdles.",
      "In December 2022, Bass declared a state of emergency concerning homelessness on her first day in office.",
      "Bass' Executive Directive 1, aimed at expediting thousands of affordable housing projects, was  also criticized by some residents for targeting areas with rent-controlled apartments that had tenants in place who would be displaced by demolition and construction or for potentially impacting wealthier, designated historic districts.",
      "The plan was recently updated in the summer of 2024 to restrict where these projects can be built by avoiding historic districts or displacing current tenants. The moves have been criticized for ultimately hindering efforts to build more affordable housing and leaving low-income housing in the balance, according to local news outlets.",
      "Bass' latest order does not note how it may impact the creation of these affordable housing projects.",
      "Since the start of her tenure, she founded Inside Safe, a program to house homeless residents in local hotels and motels. According to local reports, the program faced pushback from hotel and motel owners tasked with housing the participants and was criticized for the poor living conditions faced by those being sheltered.",
      "The program's website states it has placed more than 3,600 people in temporary housing and more than 700 in permanent housing so far.",
      "Overall, Bass' office states it has moved 23,000 homeless residents into temporary housing and doubled the number of residents it has moved into permanent housing.",

Police have confirmed that the call is from Marissa.",
      "\u201cI don't know where I am in Greensboro \u2026 he took off with my phone. I have no clue where I'm at. I have no numbers,\u201d Carmichael tells the dispatcher.",

      "Sara Carmichael said after talking to her daughter's friends, she learned that Marissa went to One17 SofaBar & Lounge, and then later went to an Airbnb for an after party, then was dropped off at the Exxon station.",
      "\"When I woke up around lunchtime, Sunday [Jan. 14], and she wasn't home, and then I found out she didn't go to work, and that's just not like her at all,\" she said when asked what prompted her to report her daughter missing. \"She's always in touch with me. So, I had a feeling.\"",

      "She also has a heart tattoo on her face and a butterfly near her eye and was wearing a white Tweety Bird T-shirt, blue jeans, and yellow sneakers when she was last seen, police said, sharing a surveillance photo with ABC News of Carmichael at the Exxon gas station on the night she was last seen.",
      "Police are asking anyone with information regarding Marissa Carmichael's whereabouts to call Crime Stoppers at 336-373-1000."

      "The Mexican drug lord who founded the Sinaloa cartel with Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman is in plea talks with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, to resolve his case before a trial that could yield the death penalty, an assistant United States attorney said during a hearing Wednesday.",
      "Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, 76, has pleaded not guilty to a slew of federal drug and weapons charges. He had been wanted in the U.S. for more than two decades when he landed over the summer at a small airport in New Mexico where he was taken into custody.",
      "A frail-looking Zambada appeared at the hearing in a beige smock over an orange T-shirt and reading glasses dangling from the collar. He held an earpiece to his right ear with an index finger to listen to the interpreter.",
      "\"The parties have been engaged in discussions to resolve the case pre-trial,\" federal prosecutor Francisco Navarro said.",
      "The judge asked the parties to return to court on April 22 and, in the meantime, to keep working on a plea deal. No trial date has been set.",
      "During the hearing, Judge Brian Cogan also allowed Zambada to keep his lawyer, Frank Perez, despite a conflict over Perez's representation of El Mayo's son, Vicente Zambada Niebla, who is cooperating with the government and who is likely to be called to testify against his father.",
      "\"Because Vicente has information that might be used against you, and indeed because Vicente may testify against you, Mr. Perez has conflicting loyalties,\" Cogan said. \"You don't have to proceed with a lawyer like Mr. Perez, who is conflicted.\"",

      "Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio must pay a $475,000 fine levied against him for misusing public funds during his failed White House bid, a judge ruled this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio must pay a $475,000 fine levied against him for misusing public funds on a police security detail during his failed White House bid, a judge ruled this week, dismissing the ex-mayor\u2019s legal challenge as \u201cperplexing\u201d and \u201centirely baseless.\u201d",
      "The decision blocks de Blasio\u2019s latest effort to erase the hefty fine issued against him by the city\u2019s ethics board in 2023. In his motion for dismissal, de Blasio argued the board provided him with murky guidance around the use of public funds for security purposes, then overstepped its authority in imposing the fine.",
      "Judge Shahabuddeen Ally roundly rejected those arguments in an 80-page ruling issued Monday, finding the mayor was \u201cexpressly and specifically\u201d informed that the city would not bear security travel costs for the cross-country campaign, but elected to bring his police detail anyway.",
      "\u201c(His) position essentially eliminates his own agency in the choices he made,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that there was no merit to \u201cthe remarkable contention that he is somehow not subject to the City\u2019s conflicts-of-interest laws.\u201d",
      "The ruling leaves de Blasio on the hook for a $320,000 in airfare and other travel costs incurred by his security detail during the four-month campaign, which he launched in 2019 while serving his second term as mayor. He will also have to pay a fine of $5,000 for each of the security detail\u2019s 31 out-of-state trips, amounting to $155,000.",
      "The fine was the largest ever handed down by New York\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board, an independent city agency tasked with holding local officials to certain ethical standards.",
      "Carolyn Lisa Miller, the executive director of the board, said the judge's ruling \u201cspeaks for itself.\u201d",
      "An attorney for de Blasio, Andrew G. Celli Jr., declined to comment. De Blasio did not return a text message.",
      "In the court filing, attorneys for de Blasio argued that forcing him to cover the cost of his security detail\u2019s travel expenses violated his 1st Amendment rights, creating an \u201cunequal burden\u201d between wealthy candidates and career public servants.",
      "They added that paying the reimbursement would have \u201cno appreciable effect on the budget of the NYPD.\u201d",
      "De Blasio has faced previous allegations of misusing his security detail. Months before he left office in 2021, a report by the city\u2019s Department of Investigation found he treated the officers as a \u201cconcierge service,\u201d using them to move his daughter into an apartment and shuttle his son to college.",
      "Since leaving office in 2021, de Blasio has worked as a lecturer at multiple universities, most recently the University of Michigan, and delivered paid speeches in Italy.",

      "Delta Air Lines topped profit and revenue expectations in the fourth quarter on strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Delta said Friday that travel demand picked up throughout the quarter. During November and December, the airline said that it saw four of the top 10 revenue days in its history and double-digit growth in cash bookings driven by both leisure and corporate travelers.",
      "\u201cAs we move into 2025, we expect strong demand for travel to continue, with consumers increasingly seeking the premium products and experiences that Delta provides,\u201d CEO Ed Bastian said in a prepared statement on Friday.",

      "Among U.S. carriers, Delta scored the highest for on-time arrivals last year, aviation-data provider Cirium reported last week. That was despite a computer outage that caused thousands of flight cancellations in July.",
      "Delta, based in Atlanta, achieved an on-time rate of more than 83%, good enough to rank third worldwide behind Aeromexico and Saudia, respectively. The next-best U.S. carriers were United Airlines, at nearly 81%, and Alaska Airlines, at just over 79%, Cirium said.",

      "NEW YORK -- New York City has shuttered a sprawling tent complex that housed hundreds of migrant families on a remote former airport in Brooklyn, as it shrinks the emergency shelter system built up in response to a surge from the southern border that has been steadily receding in recent months.",
      "The last of the roughly 2,000 people living on a windswept tarmac at Floyd Bennett Field, once the city\u2019s first airport, departed the gated encampment over the weekend, and crews were seen this week dismantling the hulking structure.",
      "Advocates had warned that the facility, which is built on leased federal land, could be vulnerable to immigration raids as President-elect Donald Trump takes office Monday.",
      "Jehinzo Gonzalez, a 47-year-old from Venezuela, said he, his wife and three sons were transferred to another nearby city-run shelter just a week before Christmas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a more dignified place for the family. We have three rooms for the five of us. Comfortable beds, a private bathroom,\u201d he said in Spanish, marveling at the contrast between the hard cots they slept on in their single room in the airport tent camp since arriving in the country in October.",
      "New York City has seen more than 250,000 migrants arrive since the spring of 2022, but the numbers of new arrivals have declined for 27 straight weeks and is now at its lowest point in more than a year, Mayor Eric Adams' administration said.",
      "Roughly 50,000 migrants are currently being housed across roughly 200 temporary sites, down from nearly 70,000 migrants last January.",
      "But the steady drum of shelter closings and forced relocations have also forced many migrant families to upend their routines for work, schooling and other daily needs just as they are trying to establish a foothold in the city.",
      "Venezuelan migrant Gabriel Montillas said he now spends hours each day in transit, chaperoning his three young children to school in Brooklyn and rushing to make appointments after his family was recently moved from the now-closed Floyd Bennett Field encampment to a hotel in Queens.",
      "On Tuesday, he had just enough time after dropping off the kids to travel across Brooklyn to submit immigration paperwork at a government office.",
      "\u201cIf it were summer or something without such cold weather, it\u2019d be different,\u201d Montillas said in Spanish as bone-rattling wind whipped around the city Tuesday. \u201cBut at least for now it\u2019s too strong, very strong; it\u2019s difficult.\u201d",
      "Groups advocating for migrants also say more needs to be done to transition migrants to more permanent housing.",
      "Among the priorities should be ending controversial policies limiting the amount of time they\u2019re allowed to remain in a shelter to investing in better case management and legal assistance so migrants can secure immigration status and work permits, said Will Watts, a deputy executive director at the Coalition for the Homeless.",
      "Newly arrived migrants should also be brought into the city\u2019s traditional shelter system for the homeless so that they are no longer segregated and vulnerable to immigration enforcement, said Steph Rudolph, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society.",
      "Trump has promised a nationwide immigration crackdown, including mass deportations, when he officially takes office Monday.",
      "\u201cNow that the numbers are going down, the rationale for a separate system is no longer there,\u201d Rudolph said Wednesday. \u201cIt makes sense to bring everyone under the same system.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez said he worries about his family\u2019s future even as they were relieved to transfer out of the Floyd Bennett Field shelter.",
      "\u201cThey should respect the laws,\u201d he said of the incoming Trump administration, noting that he and his wife have already applied for asylum, have their working papers in order and are employed part-time at a local grocery. \u201cWe are doing everything as dictated by the laws of the country. We hope to God that everything goes well.\u201d",
      "More shelter closures are slated in the coming weeks as Adams\u2019 administration continues to shrink the shelter system. Another huge tent complex built on Randall\u2019s Island, an island park off Manhattan, has been steadily emptied of residents ahead of its scheduled closure next month.",
      "The administration on Friday also announced the closure of 10 other shelters, including one built in a complex of warehouses off a highway in Brooklyn that housed more than 3,300 single men at its peak.",
      "All told, the moves will reduce the city\u2019s migrant housing capacity by roughly 7,800 beds -- after accounting for a new, brick-and-mortar shelter being built in the Bronx to house more than 2,200 migrant men being transferred from the tent shelters earmarked for closure, according to the mayor\u2019s office.",

      "NORFOLK, Va. -- A Virginia man pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a federal case that accuses him of stockpiling the largest number of finished explosives in FBI history and using President Joe Biden\u2019s photo for target practice.",
      "Chained at his legs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, Brad Spafford, 36, said little beyond answering mostly \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d questions from a federal magistrate during his arraignment in U.S. District Court in Norfolk.",
      "The hearing focused mostly on setting a May 28 trial date, which is needed to give enough time to attorneys to review a vast trove of evidence.",
      "Rebecca Gantt, a federal prosecutor, told a judge that authorities are still analyzing evidence from the FBI's seizure of approximately 150 pipe bombs and other homemade devices at Spafford's home in Isle of Wight County, which is northwest of Norfolk.",
      "Most of the explosives were detonated on Spafford's property, requiring soil analyses, while some devices were taken to a lab for examination, Gantt said. She added that investigators were still going through Spafford's electronic devices, including a phone with 500,000 images on it, among other evidence.",
      "Spafford faces one count of possession of an unregistered destructive device and one count of possession of an unregistered short barrel rifle. Both are felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "One of Spafford's attorneys, Kenneth Woodward, mentioned to the judge that the National Firearms Act, under which Spafford is charged, does not define what is an explosive.",
      "Woodward declined to comment after Wednesday's hearing. But Spafford's attorneys have questioned whether the explosive devices found on his property were usable because \u201cprofessionally trained explosive technicians had to rig the devices to explode them.\"",
      "\u201cThere is not a shred of evidence in the record that Mr. Spafford ever threatened anyone and the contention that someone might be in danger because of their political views and comments is nonsensical,\u201d his defense lawyers wrote in a court filing after his arrest.",
      "The investigation into Spafford began in 2023 when an informant told authorities that Spafford was stockpiling weapons and ammunition, according to court documents. The informant, a friend and member of law enforcement, told authorities that Spafford was using pictures of the president for target practice and that \u201che believed political assassinations should be brought back,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Numerous law enforcement officers and bomb technicians searched the property on Dec. 17.",
      "Spafford stored a highly unstable explosive material in a garage freezer next to \u201cHot Pockets and frozen corn on the cob,\u201d according to court documents. Investigators also said they found explosive devices in an unsecured backpack labeled \u201c#NoLivesMatter.\u201d",
      "Spafford's attorneys had argued for his release as he awaits trial. But last week, a federal judge ruled he must stay in jail, writing that Spafford has \u201cshown the capacity for extreme danger.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Arenda L. Wright Allen noted in her ruling that Spafford lost three fingers in an accident involving homemade explosives in 2021, something she said his defense attorneys have not disputed.",
      "Defense attorneys had argued that that Spafford, who is married and a father of two young daughters, works a steady job as a machinist and has no criminal record.",
      "Defense attorney Jeffrey Swartz said at Spafford\u2019s detention hearing that investigators had gathered information on him since January 2023, during which Spafford never threatened anyone.",

      "Investigators, however, said they had limited knowledge of the homemade bombs until an informant visited Spafford\u2019s home, federal prosecutors wrote in a filing.",

      "A man convicted in the first trial highlighting U.S. claims that China harasses its critics overseas has been sentenced to two years in prison",
      "NEW YORK -- A man convicted in the first trial highlighting U.S. claims that China harasses its critics overseas was sentenced Wednesday to two years in prison for his role in a creepy campaign to get a former official to return to his homeland.",
      "Zhu Yong, a Chinese retiree who faces likely deportation from the U.S. after his prison term, expressed regret while suggesting he didn't initially think through the implications of what he was doing.",
      "\u201cI also plead to the nation, the victims and every American citizen for their forgiveness,\u201d he told a court through a Mandarin-language interpreter. He begged a judge for \u201ca chance to renew myself\u201d and to see his grandchild grow up in the U.S.",
      "Zhu, 68, was one of three men found guilty of various charges in a 2023 trial that portrayed cross-border surveillance and stalking in suburban New Jersey.",
      "The target, a former Chinese city official named Xu Jin, was subjected to subtle and overt pressure to go back to China, where he and his wife have been accused of bribery, according to testimony. They deny the allegation and say he was targeted because of internal politics within China\u2019s Communist government.",
      "Their adult daughter's Facebook friends got disparaging messages about him. Xu's octogenarian father was abruptly flown from China to the U.S. to implore him to come back. Finally, an ominous note was taped on the man's own New Jersey door.",
      "\u201cIf you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison,\u201d the message read in translation, \"your wife and children will be all right. That\u2019s the end of this matter!\u201d",
      "Zhu, who also goes by Jason Zhu and Yong Zhu, was convicted of charges including stalking and acting as an illegal foreign agent. The charges carried the potential for up to 25 years in prison; prosecutors sought a roughly six-year sentence.",
      "Calling the crimes \u201ca threat to this country's national security,\" U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen quizzed Zhu about what he was thinking when he agreed to help a Chinese government figure find Xu. A former official in the city of Wuhan, Xu had left China with his wife in 2010.",
      "Zhu \u2014 who didn't testify at his trial \u2014 told the judge he'd been asked only to help locate Xu and hadn't known what was in store for the ex-official. The defendant said he'd been told Xu owed money.",
      "\u201cAt some point, Mr. Zhu, did you believe that your actions were going to result in some harm?\u201d the judge asked.",
      "\u201cAfter I was arrested, I realized that could be the case,\u201d he said.",
      "Prosecutors have called the case an example of transnational repression, or governments working to intimidate, silence or even attack dissenters beyond their borders. Several U.S. prosecutions have centered on China\u2019s \u201cOperation Fox Hunt,\u201d a nearly decade-old initiative that Beijing characterizes as a pursuit of fugitives abroad, including officials accused of corruption.",
      "The U.S. and China don\u2019t have an extradition treaty, meaning Beijing can\u2019t legally compel people to be returned for prosecution. The Chinese government has denied threatening people to get them back.",
      "Zhu and co-defendants Michael McMahon and Zheng Congying didn't dispute taking various actions in the case. Zhu helped hire and brief McMahon, a retired U.S. police sergeant turned private investigator, to find their quarry.",
      "At trial, defense lawyers said the men believed they were working on behalf of private individuals or a company, not Chinese authorities. The attorneys said the three were told they were helping collect a debt or accomplish some other business.",
      "Zhu's current lawyer said Wednesday that his client came to understand that Chinese government officials were involved but didn't grasp how seriously Xu might be pressed to return.",
      "The judge concluded Zhu acted knowingly, but naively.",
      "He \u201creally failed to appreciate the scope and the gravity of his conduct and the real harm he has caused to these victims and to this country,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhu is due to turn himself in April 15 for his prison term. McMahon and Zheng are to be sentenced later this winter.",
      "Eight other people also have been charged in the alleged conspiracy. Three have pleaded guilty. Five others are believed to be in China."

      "Attorneys for an Alabama inmate facing execution by nitrogen gas are asking a federal judge to block the upcoming execution",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Attorneys for an Alabama inmate scheduled to be the fourth person put to death with nitrogen gas on Wednesday asked a federal judge to block the execution, arguing that the first three inmates showed signs of suffering from suffocation as the gas flowed.",
      "Demetrius Terrence Frazier, 52, is scheduled to be executed Feb. 6 for the 1991 murder and rape of Pauline Brown. His attorneys in a Wednesday court filing asked a judge to block the execution unless the state makes changes to the protocol, such as giving him a sedative before the gas begins flowing. The court filing cited witness descriptions of the state\u2019s first three executions with nitrogen gas.",
      "\u201cThe data set for nitrogen hypoxia executions is small \u2014three \u2014 but provides clear results: Alabama\u2019s method does not work the way defendants claim and necessarily causes conscious suffocation, in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\u201d lawyers for Frazier wrote in the court filing.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Three inmates were put to death using the new method last year. The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the person\u2019s face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.",
      "Media witnesses, including The Associated Press, described how the men shook on the gurney for the first minutes of their execution, followed by what appeared to be several minutes of periodic labored breaths with long pauses in between.",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office has not yet filed a response to the request to block the execution. The state previously asked a federal judge to dismiss Frazier\u2019s lawsuit over the execution method, arguing the movements exhibited by the inmates were not a sign of suffering.",
      "\u201cHe never confronts more likely causes of movement, including voluntary resistance or involuntary movements associated with dying, which can be misperceived as signs of consciousness or distress,\u201d lawyers for the state wrote in a Christmas Eve court filing.",
      "Lethal injection remains Alabama\u2019s primary execution method.",
      "Alabama in 2018 became the third state to authorize the use of nitrogen gas to execute prisoners. Alabama gave inmates a brief window to select their preferred execution method. Frazier was among inmates who selected nitrogen gas as their preferred execution method, but at the time the state had not developed procedures for using the gas to carry out an execution.",
      "Frazier was convicted of killing Brown in her Birmingham apartment. Prosecutors said Frazier, while in police custody in Detroit on an unrelated charge, confessed to raping and shooting Brown after stealing about $80 from her purse. A jury voted 10-2 that he receive a death sentence. A judge sentenced him to death."

      "The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission approved an application for a gate Tuesday after Barbara Lorber, who has owned the building since 1978, lamented \u201cthe endless presence of interest in my celebrity staircase.\u201d The stately three-story building in Greenwich Village's historic district was used for exterior shots of the apartment occupied by Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d hoped for literally decades that this would pass,\u201d Lorber told the commission during heartfelt testimony. \u201cBut at this point, I think even someone as stubborn as I am has to admit that this isn\u2019t going away in the near future.\u201d",
      "The stoop has been chained off with a \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign. But one neighbor told the commission that the chain has failed to deter fans of the show, who create a nuisance on the block.",
      "Eight commission members unanimously approved the application, which is a necessary step in the historic West Village neighborhood. Lorber's architect will work with commission staff on a final gate design.",
      "\u201cSex and the City\u201d followed the exploits and relationships of Bradshaw and her three pals for six seasons beginning in 1998. In the show, Carrie Bradshaw lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which in real life is a decent cab ride away from the building used for exterior shots during filming.

      "MARIETTA, Ga. -- Former professional football and baseball player Bo Jackson is giving up a $21 million judgment against his niece and nephew, whom he said harassed and tried to extort money from him.",
      "A judge in February ruled in Jackson's favor in the suit he had filed in April 2023 against Thomas Lee Anderson and Erica M. Anderson, also known as Erica Anderson Ross. Jackson, a running back who won the Heisman Trophy at Auburn and also played in both the NFL and MLB, Jackson had alleged in his lawsuit that his relatives tried to extort $20 million from him through harassment and intimidation.",
      "In addition to the monetary award, last year's ruling included a permanent protective order barring his niece and nephew from bothering or contacting him and his immediate family. It also said they must stay at least 500 yards (meters) from the Jacksons and remove social media posts about them.",
      "Cobb County Superior Court Judge Jason D. Marbutt said in his February order that neither Jackson's niece and nephew nor their attorneys rebutted Jackson\u2019s claims or participated in the case after a May 2023 hearing, when they consented to a temporary protective order. The judge found the Andersons to be in default, accepting as true all of Jackson\u2019s allegations.",
      "After that ruling was issued, a new lawyer for the Andersons filed a motion in March to set aside that judgment and to dismiss the lawsuit, according to court filings. In a filing Tuesday, Jackson and the Andersons jointly asked the judge to throw out February's order, withdraw the Andersons' pending motions and enter a consent judgment.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, the Parties have conducted two mediations and have reached a private agreement resolving this dispute,\u201d the filing says.",
      "Marbutt on Wednesday issued an order vacating his February ruling at the request of Jackson and his niece and nephew.",
      "That consent judgment finds in Jackson's favor on several counts and dismisses others, awards no damages either to Jackson or his niece and nephew and says the parties shall pay their own attorneys' fees. It also says the Andersons must not harass or intimidate Jackson and his wife and children and stay 500 yards (meters) away from them, except in certain circumstances, including court appearances, sporting events and family functions. The Andersons are also not to have any contact with Jackson and his wife and children.",
      "Jackson, 62, had alleged that the harassment began in 2022 and included threatening social media posts and messages, public allegations that put him in a false light. He also alleged that public disclosure of private information was intended to cause him severe emotional distress. With the help of an attorney, the Andersons demanded $20 million to stop. He said he feared for his own safety and that of his family."

      "Vought faced questions at his confirmation hearing over his tenure as director of the Office and Management and Budget during Trump's first term. He stressed that he would follow the law, even as he emphasized Trump\u2019s desire to overturn the 1974 Impoundment Control Act that requires congressional approval to rescind spending.",
      "Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., accused him of withholding $214 million in military aid for Ukraine in 2019, an event that led to Trump\u2019s first impeachment.",
      "\u201cI will always commit to upholding the law,\" said Vought, an answer that did not satisfy Peters.",
      "As the hearings continued, Vought's answer changed somewhat when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked if he would approve the distribution of $3.8 billion in aid for Ukraine for its ongoing war against Russia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to get ahead of the policy response of the incoming administration,\u201d said Vought, who in 2021 founded the Center for Renewing America, a conservative think tank.",
      "Blumenthal responded: \u201cI am astonished and aghast that someone in this responsible position would, in effect, say that the president is above the law.\u201d",
      "Still, in response to questions from Republican lawmakers, Vought did preview possible budget proposals by suggesting that spending cuts would be necessary to address persistent budget deficits that have pushed the publicly held national debt above $28 trillion.",
      "Vought, an architect of Project 2025, said the debt would leave future generations poorer as more and more tax dollars went to repayment.",

The analysis found that Trump's policies had increased the debt by $8.4 trillion, while Biden's policies pushed up the debt by $4.3 trillion. Much of the additional debt was the consequence of responding to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- The mother of a North Carolina university student killed while on a ride-along in a Highway Patrol cruiser can continue suing for gross negligence the trooper who drove off the road during a high-speed chase, a state appeals court ruled Wednesday.",
      "By a 2-1 decision, judges on the intermediate-level state Court of Appeals reversed a trial court\u2019s ruling that dismissed the lawsuit filed on behalf of the late Michael Higgins seeking damages from Trooper Omar Romero Mendoza.",
      "One night in August 2020, Mendoza \u2014 known as Romero in patrol documents \u2014 drove through a curve on a Pitt County road after having been traveling over 110 mph (177 kph), striking a utility pole and two trees. Higgins, 22, an East Carolina University criminal justice major enrolled in a patrol internship program and inside the cruiser with Romero, died from his injuries.",
      "Lisa Higgins, the administrator of her son\u2019s estate, sued in 2022 both Romero and Trooper Brandon Cesar Cruz, who had suggested to her son that he ride with Romero when Cruz lacked the time to do so. Superior Court Judge William Wolfe dismissed in 2023 the lawsuit against both troopers. Cruz was removed from Lisa Higgins\u2019 appeal last year.",
      "Higgins had previously participated in two successful ride-alongs with other patrol officers. But neither Romero nor Cruz held the rank or the title to complete one \u2014 something that Higgins was apparently unaware of at the time, the majority opinion said.",
      "Romero and Higgins responded to the scene of where a car had driven off the road into a ditch. Cruz also responded to the scene and encouraged Romero to pursue in a high-speed chase an unidentified driver in the area observed with an alcohol odor on her breath, according to trooper statements.",
      "Romero activated his emergency lights and siren and with Higgins as a passenger accelerated the vehicle quickly to attempt to catch the driver. Romero stated at a deposition that he saw the suspect breaking to the left but believed the two-lane road that he was traveling on was straight. A patrol report determined Romero had violated patrol policy in how he initiated the \u201ctraffic enforcement response.\u201d",
      "Romero\u2019s lawyer argued that as a government official Romero was exempt from personal civil liability while pursuing a criminal suspect, and that the state Industrial Commission was where claims against a state employee's actions could be brought. Commission awards are capped.",
      "In the majority opinion, Court of Appeals Judge John Arrowood wrote that the speed limit exemption in a police pursuit did not protect an officer from the \u201cconsequence of a reckless disregard of the safety of others.\u201d And the evidence and testimony suggest there is a genuine issue of material fact that the trooper\u2019s action rose to the level of gross negligence, he added.",
      "\u201cIt should be for the jury to determine whether defendant Romero\u2019s actions were needless or manifested a reckless indifference to the rights of Michael,\u201d Arrowood wrote.",
      "Court of Appeals Judge Allegra Collins agreed with Arrowood. In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Chief Judge Chris Dillon wrote that in the most favorable light for the plaintiff, the evidence doesn\u2019t show Romero acted with gross negligence.",
      "Though how Romero \u201cexercised his discretion in his pursuit of the suspected drunk driver may have been negligent, it did not rise to the level of \u2018wanton conduct,\u2019 done with \u2018corruption or malice,\u2019 \u201d Dillon added.",
      "The state Supreme Court could hear the case if requested.",
      "A lawyer representing Romero didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "Jim White, an attorney representing Lisa Higgins, was pleased with Wednesday\u2019s ruling, saying too many legal cases had given extreme deference to officers for their actions while wearing a uniform and traveling with blue lights on.",
      "A jury trial would provide \u201cvindication\u201d to the Higgins family, White said, leading to an acknowledgement that \u201che never should have been in that car.\u201d"

      "Curry had other ties to the movie industry, starting after she struck up a friendship with Nellie Crawford, who went by the stage name of Madame Sul-Te-Wan, at a Los Angeles beauty salon in the early 1950s, Kelley says, telling her grandmother's stories as best she can.",
      "Crawford was the first Black woman to be featured in films after signing her contract with Fine Arts. She appeared in such movies as the 1915 landmark film \u201cBirth of a Nation.\u201d When Curry told Crawford she was interested in arts and theater, Crawford said: \u201c\u2019Well, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m going to take you under my wing. You\u2019re my goddaughter\u201d.",

      "\u201cIt was a small part, but we were big proud,\u201d Kelley said. Curry also worked as an extra in \u201cLady Sings the Blues\u201d and \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d her granddaughter said, and sang and danced backing up Pearl Bailey in venues across the U.S.",
      "In later life Curry became a nurse, working in convalescent homes and in private care. Curry, who used her maiden name, had one son. She also is survived by seven grandchildren and many great-grandchildren.",

      "The lawsuit in Kentucky, filed Tuesday in Franklin County Circuit Court in the state's capital city, seeks to reopen the case that led to a landmark 1989 Kentucky Supreme Court ruling that the state's K-12 system was inequitable and inadequate and ordered the legislature to fix it.",
      "The result, a year later, was the Kentucky Education Reform Act, which reshaped the foundations of education, including a new school funding formula that the new lawsuit said increased funding for all students and aimed to ensure equity in funding among school districts. The Kentucky law, known as KERA, became a national model for education reforms in the 1990s, the lawsuit said.",
      "In the first decade after KERA's enactment, the gap in per-capita spending between poor and wealthier districts narrowed substantially, the lawsuit said. But in the past two decades, the state has failed to maintain adequate base funding amounts, putting a heavier financial burden on local districts, it said.",
      "The result is a gap in per-capita spending between the poorest and wealthiest districts that exceeds the disparities deemed unconstitutional in 1989 by the state Supreme Court, the lawsuit said.",
      "The student plaintiffs want a judge to decide whether Kentucky schoolchildren are receiving the adequate and equitable education that the state's highest court mandated 36 years ago.",
      "There are other shortcomings, the lawsuit said, including a decline in literacy skills among many students, a lack of civics education and the lack of adequate counseling resources at many Kentucky schools.",
      "\u201cThe Commonwealth of Kentucky, which was the national model for effective education reform in the 1990s, has now fallen behind in educational practices and accomplishments,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Education funding is always a main focus when Kentucky lawmakers craft the state's next budget. Republicans touted the amounts devoted to education in the two-year budget passed last year.",
      "Per-pupil funding was increased under the state\u2019s main funding formula for public K-12 schools, as was state funding for local districts' transportation costs. The budget is steering more state money to poorer districts, and lawmakers bolstered state funding for the teachers pension system.",
      "The lawsuit is fighting back against that narrative.",
      "\u201cSince the 1990s, base funding of education by the state has declined by approximately 25% in inflation-adjusted terms, and the state share of total education costs has fallen from 75% to 50%, placing a heavier and often unmanageable financial burden on local school districts,\u201d the suit said.",
      "Students said their lawsuit is no reflection on classroom teachers in Kentucky.",
      "\"This lawsuit targets systemic failures, not individual schools or teachers,\u201d said Luisa Sanchez, a student plaintiff and a high school junior in Boyle County. \u201cWe see the dedication of educators every day, but the root cause of these challenges lies in state-level decision-making and resource inequities.\u201d",
      "The case is likely to end up before Kentucky's Supreme Court, said Michael Rebell, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys. Given the time it takes to litigate the case, the older students involved as plaintiffs realize they won't directly benefit from a favorable outcome, he said.",
      "\u201cSome of them talk about they hope their brothers and sisters will benefit,\u201d he said Wednesday. \"But most of them talk in terms of they\u2019re doing this for the future and for Kentucky students that they don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "Federal investigators have found in a report that a large South Carolina jail vastly underreports the violence behind its walls, lets dozens of inmates go unsupervised for long periods and lets crimes against prisoners go unpunished",
      "COLUMBIA, S,C. -- Federal investigators found in a scathing report this week that a large jail in South Carolina vastly underreports the violence occurring behind its walls and lets dozens of inmates go unsupervised for so long that at least two killings of prisoners were reported to jail staff from outside callers.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice told the jail in Richland County, which includes South Carolina's capital of Columbia, that it must improve conditions as soon as possible \u2014 repairing holes in walls, fixing locks that don't lock at all and fixing broken light fixtures that otherwise might be turned into weapons.",
      "The jail also must stop the flow of contraband, it said. Cellphones are used to orchestrate gang beatings even as inmates are moved from one wing to another for safety. Drugs brought into the facility caused eight prisoners to overdose in two months last year, according to the report released Wednesday by federal investigators.",
      "The 36-page report is filled with stunning details and damning facts.",
      "Named the Alvin S. Glenn Detention Center, for a guard killed by inmates during an escape attempt in 2000, the jail has more openings for guards than the current number of actual officers, the report said. It added that hours go by without a single employee checking on jail wings and keys have gone unaccounted for.",
      "According to the report, the jail has four times as many assaults as the Miami-Dade jail even though the south Florida jail has four times as many inmates. It also said a private company that helps with security has hired people with felony convictions.",
      "The report also details stories about people charged but not convicted of crimes and waiting in jail for their trials.",
      "One inmate who has been at the jail for three years was beaten and stabbed and the jail took no action until his mother called them two days later, the report said. It added he was beaten again and a guard only responded when other prisoners reported he was bleeding. He was attacked a third time by four inmates and then a fourth time by seven prisoners only receiving help when an inmate called the central command center and reported him bleeding and crying, the report indicated.",
      "The report said on two occasions jail officials only learned of inmate killings from outsider callers: Once, someone left a message with the jail director that an inmate was dead in a pool of blood. A second time, a jail nurse got a call from someone outside who watched the killing on Facebook Live, according to the report.",
      "\u201cIndividuals who are charged with a crime and detained at Alvin S. Glenn face very real possibilities of being stabbed, raped and beaten before they ever see a courtroom. Such conditions violates the U.S. Constitution,\" U.S. Attorney Adair Boroughs said.",
      "Richland County officials didn't respond to messages seeking comment. Boroughs noted the county began repairs on the jail and started overhauling procedures and staffing after the investigation was announced more than a year ago. She urged them to keep up the work or the federal government would file suit.",
      "The report said criminal conduct in the jail often goes unpunished.",
      "\u201cWe found multiple, multiple incidents where crime scenes were cleaned up by inmates before the sheriff's office was ever notified \u2014 or perhaps they were never notified,\u201d Boroughs said at a news conference.",
      "The federal government continues to investigate the jail in Charleston County and has a court order against the Department of Juvenile Justice prisons in the state. In all, more than a dozen jails and prisons across the U.S. are under federal investigations or court orders.",
      "According to the report, an inmate told of being raped and genetic material found on his back matched another inmate. But it said there was no record of any further investigation being conducted.",
      "Another inmate threatened to commit suicide to get moved out of one unit where he reported a rape. In the next unit, he was raped again after he couldn't get a relative outside to pay $200 to the prisoner who attacked him, according to the report.",
      "The report has four pages of requirements for the jail.",
      "It said the jail needs to have at least one guard on each wing at all times and a second guard who walks between two wings. The jail also needs to stop requiring inmates to file grievances with an officer assigned to their unit.",
      "The jail also needs to do full searches of all employees for contraband, the report advised, adding workers were bringing illegal items into the prison in lunch coolers and under food containers.",
      "\"Corrections officers have a duty to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners, for being violently assaulted in prison is simply not part of the penalty that criminal offenders pay for their offenses against society,\" the investigators wrote in their report."

      "Chris Wright, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for energy secretary, told senators during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that he would promote all sources of American energy, while also acknowledging the burning of fossil fuels causes climate change.",
      "Wright, a fossil fuel executive, has been one of the industry\u2019s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change. He believes that more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe. His nomination went before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for a confirmation hearing. Protesters interrupted it multiple times.",
      "Here are the most interesting moments:",
      "CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, Wright promised to help Trump \"unleash energy security and prosperity.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of Trump\u2019s energy policy is \u201cdrill, baby, drill,\u201d and he has pledged to dismantle what he calls Democrats\u2019 \u201cgreen new scam\u201d in favor of boosting production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal, which cause climate change \u2014 when they burn, greenhouse gases are released.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump shares my passion for energy,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd if confirmed, I will work tirelessly to implement his bold agenda as an unabashed steward for all sources of affordable, reliable and secure American energy.\u201d",
      "He said that includes oil and natural gas, which underpin the nation's economy; coal, nuclear power and hydropower as major sources of energy; rapidly-growing wind and solar power; and geothermal energy, which could become a meaningful source of energy.",
      "Sen. John Hickenlooper, D-Colo., called Wright an \u201cunrestrained enthusiast for fossils fuels in almost every regard,\u201d but noted that he studied nuclear, worked on solar energy and is a scientist who is open to discussion.",
      "Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, said he thinks Wright's position on climate change is \u201cmore subtle than is publicly recognized\u201d and that he doesn't deny climate change is happening or that it's related to the combustion of fossil fuels, which are drastically increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.",
      "Wright responded \u201cabsolutely,\u201d adding that \u201cmostly from the combustion of hydrocarbons to enable our modern world, we\u2019ve increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 50%,\u201d making it harder for the Earth to shed heat.",
      "Though he said climate change is real, he also said \u201cthere isn\u2019t dirty energy or clean energy.\u201d Rather, he said, there are different sources of energy with different tradeoffs.",
      "\u201cEnergy is critical to human lives. Climate change is a global challenge that we need to solve,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd tradeoffs between those two are the decisions politicians make and they're the decisions that will impact the future of our world and our quality of life.\u201d",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., asked Wright if he still believes that \u201cwildfires are just hype\u201d following the massive blazes in Southern California, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed thousands of homes.",
      "Scientists say climate change means more frequent and intense wildfires, with drought-like conditions in the western U.S., are more likely.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve written that the hype over wildfires is just hype to justify more impoverishment from bad government policies,\u201d Padilla said. \u201cAnd given the devastation that we\u2019re currently experiencing in Los Angeles, do you still believe that wildfires are just hype?\u201d",
      "Wright said he stood by his past comments. He then said climate change is real before Padilla cut him off.",
      "Padilla said, \u201ctell that to the families of the more than two dozen lost in these fires and counting.\u201d",
      "One protester yelled \u201cLA is burning\u201d and another shouted \u201cI\u2019m 18 years old and I want a future!\u201d They held up signs that read, \u201cbig oil profits, LA burns.\u201d",
      "A disruption prompted the Republican Committee Chair, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, to briefly halt the hearing, saying the committee would stand in recess until the Capitol Police could restore order.",
      "Wright's company is an investor in Fervo Energy, a Houston-based geothermal company that makes electricity cleanly from the Earth's heat. He serves on the board of directors of Oklo, a developer of small modular nuclear reactors.",
      "Wright said he's excited about geothermal as an \u201can enormous, abundant energy resource below everyone\u2019s feet.\u201d Wright said he wants to accelerate the development of nuclear energy so it can meet a far greater share of the world's demand for electricity.",
      "Republican Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski asked Wright if he would support a proposed mega-gas project in her home state to export liquefied natural gas overseas. He said it's a \u201ctremendous idea\u201d and \u201cgreat for our country\u201d to grow natural gas production in Alaska and build infrastructure to export it.",
      "Wright said he will sever all ties across the energy industry if confirmed."

      "More than 260,000 former students of the now-defunct for-profit Ashford University are getting their student loans erased as the Biden administration presses ahead with debt forgiveness in its final days",
      "WASHINGTON -- More than 260,000 former students of the now-defunct for-profit Ashford University are getting their student loans erased as the Biden administration presses ahead with debt forgiveness in its final days.",
      "Ashford was once one of the nation\u2019s largest for-profit college companies, with more than 100,000 students. It was owned by the company Zovio until the University of Arizona bought the online college in 2020.",
      "The Education Department started forgiving loans for Ashford students after a California court found the college routinely misled prospective students about its accreditation, costs and the time it would take to graduate.",
      "In 2023 the agency canceled loans for an initial 2,300 former Ashford students who applied for relief through the borrower defense program. The new action expands forgiveness to all former students who attended during the alleged misconduct, even if they didn't apply for relief.",
      "The administration\u2019s new action will erase loan balances for borrowers who attended Ashford from March 2009 through April 2020.",
      "In a rare move, the department also sought to forbid Zovio\u2019s founder from acting as an executive for any institution that receives federal financial aid. A statement from the agency said it\u2019s proposing to debar Andrew Clark for at least three years because he \u201cnot only supervised the unlawful conduct, he personally participated in it, driving some of the worst aspects of the boiler-room-style recruiting culture.\u201d",
      "The issue will be decided by the department's Office of Hearings and Appeals. A message was left with an attorney who represented Clark when he was at Zovio.",
      "The Biden administration previously said it would try to recoup money from the University of Arizona to offset the cancellation, saying the university inherited liability when it bought Ashford. That effort appears to have stalled, however, and it's unlikely to be picked up by the Trump administration, which is expected to be far friendlier to the for-profit college industry.",
      "Republicans in Congress have clashed with the Biden administration over student loan cancelation, saying it's a presidential overstep that puts the burden on taxpayers who didn't go to college. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., issued a report this month saying Biden \u201ctried to stretch every possible law\u201d and abused the borrower defense program to cancel loans.",
      "She took issue with the very practice used in the Ashford case \u2014 automatically canceling loans for big batches of borrowers even if they didn't apply for relief. When Trump takes office, Foxx wrote, \u201cthe jig will finally be up.\u201d",
      "This month Biden separately announced a final round of forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. With that action, the administration had provided loan relief to more than 5 million borrowers through a variety of existing programs, more than any other president.",
      "Still, Biden failed to deliver his promise for widespread student loan forgiveness. The Supreme Court blocked his plan to erase up to $20,000 for more than 40 million Americans, and a second attempt was tangled up in federal courts after several Republican states challenged it.",

      "MIAMI -- Attorneys for the state of Florida argued before a federal appeals court Wednesday that a lower-court judge was wrong to block a law last year that bans gender-affirming care for minors and restricts similar care for adults, though a pending U.S. Supreme Court case creates uncertainty.",
      "Attorneys presented oral arguments before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Miami. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court is already reviewing a similar ban in Tennessee, and the conservative court's ruling could affect laws in about two dozen other states.",
      "Florida's law prohibits transgender minors from being prescribed puberty blockers and hormonal treatments, even with their parents\u2019 permission. It also requires that transgender adults only receive treatment from a doctor and not from a registered nurse or other qualified medical practitioner. Adults who want the treatment must be in the room with the physician when signing the consent form.",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle had blocked the law in June, but a three-judge panel last fall stayed the lower court order against the ban while the matter is appealed, meaning the ban is currently being enforced.",
      "For minors, the only treatments at issue are puberty blocking treatments and cross-sex hormones \u2014 giving testosterone to someone assigned female at birth, for example. Those who were undergoing treatment when the law was adopted in May 2023 were allowed to continue. Surgery, which is rare for minors, was still blocked.",
      "As part of the state's appeal, attorney Mohammad Jazil told a three-judge appeals panel on Wednesday that Hinkle was wrong to conclude that the law was based on hostility from state officials and lawmakers against transgender people, rather than sound medical science.",
      "\u201cThe district court itself recognizes that there are concerns with this treatment, that guardrails are appropriate, stringent regulation is appropriate,\" Jazil said.",
      "The district judge was wrong to prioritize the views of a few lawmakers over the meritorious reasons to regulate treatment, Jazil said.",
      "\u201cThe district court relied on the statements of seven or so legislators to paint the entire Florida Legislature with a discriminatory animus towards transgender individuals and the two independent boards of medicine,\u201d Jazil said. \u201cAnd I think that that was wrong. That was an error.\u201d",
      "A group of Florida families, represented by GLAD Law and other civil rights groups, filed the initial lawsuit challenging the ban. They were later joined by four adult plaintiffs. Hinkle sided with the group, ruling that the ban is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and motivated by purposeful discrimination against transgender people.",
      "Adam Unikowsky, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, told the judges Wednesday that Hinkle relied on more than just the statements of seven lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI think it considered that as one piece of circumstantial evidence in the overall evidentiary picture alongside other types of circumstantial evidence,\u201d Unikowsky said.",
      "As an example, Unikowsky referenced another Florida law, signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis the same day as the gender-affirming care restrictions, that prevents public school employees from using their preferred pronouns if they don't correspond to that employee's birth sex.",
      "\u201cAnd what the district court inferred from that was that the Legislature\u2019s goal was to deter people from transitioning,\u201d Unikowsky said. \u201cAnd it felt that it was hostile to the concept of people transitioning. It just didn\u2019t want people to do that.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments in December on Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors, though the justices\u2019 decision is not expected for several months. The case is being weighed by a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "Both attorneys at Wednesday's hearing were asked whether the appeals court should wait until the Supreme Court ruled before the lower court made a decision. Jazil said the appeal process should be paused because the Florida and Tennessee laws are so similar. Unikowsky said the Florida case should move forward because of differences in the legal arguments against both laws.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. The states that have passed laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors are: Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming."

      "Alexander Justin White, a U.S. citizen from Durham, is accused of providing, attempting and conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization by federal prosecutors.

Some of the content included IS and other Islamic extremist propaganda videos.",
      "During this period, federal prosecutors said White spoke to several social media users who claimed to be from the Middle East and North Africa about his support for IS. He told several users that he wished to travel to Africa to join IS as well, according to court documents. White also lamented missed opportunities to join the militant group in previous trips \u2014 such as in a 2018 visit to Egypt \u2014 in conversations online, authorities said.",
      "White also conversed frequently with a covert FBI agent over several months, which included several mentions of wanting to join IS and a staged video call that White believed was with an IS commander's spokesperson, prosecutors said.",
      "During text conversations with the agent, officials said White expressed his willingness to be a mujahid, the Arabic word for \u201choly warrior,\u201d and discussed fundraising for detained IS members and their family members.",
      "After several months of discussing his plans to travel abroad and join IS, White sent the agent a screenshot of his upcoming travel itinerary, which showed a Dec. 4 flight departing from the Raleigh-Durham International Airport to Rabat, Morocco, court records show.",
      "To not raise suspicions about the flight, White purchased a round-trip ticket, prosecutors said.",
      "White later arrived on Dec. 4 with three bags at RDU Airport, where he checked in for his connecting flight to Paris and proceeded through security, authorities said. He was then arrested a few hours later while attempting to board the plane.",
      "A federal public defender who was appointed to represent White declined to comment about the pending case on Wednesday.",

      "The federal government is withdrawing proposed rules that would have required more ships to slow down in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would require more ships to slow down in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and its population has plummeted in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we\u2019ve watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\u201d Brogan said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\u201d",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have long argued that tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups sued to try to speed up the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\u201d said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \u201cThe way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "Right whales were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of the rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia had head injuries consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",
      "The whales numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has ticked up slightly more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \u201ca leading cause of the species\u2019 decline,\u201d the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",

    "title": "Why a small drop in inflation matters to you",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 14:13:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The marginal dip in UK inflation is unusually important and offers some respite to the chancellor.",
    "story": [
      "A marginal dip in the headline rate of inflation would not normally determine much, if anything.",
      "Inflation rising at 2.5% rather than 2.6% does not change much in big economics, nor in the cost of living squeeze felt by households. The fall is entirely accounted for by falls in hotel prices and a smaller-than-usual rise in airfares in December.",
      "But this unusually important 0.1% drop signals relief, and some respite for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, because of what underpins it.",
      "The underlying inflation numbers, which show where price pressures are going over the year, are what is most keenly watched by the Bank of England in terms of interest rate cuts.",
      "Core inflation, which strips out the direct impact of volatile energy and food prices is now at a four-year low, having dropped to 3.2% in December from 3.5%. Services inflation is at a two-year low of 4.4% after a chunky fall from 5%. This is the real positive news.",
      "For the real nerds, inflation in supply chains, including in services, also indicates muted inflationary pressures.",
      "So the inflationary picture in the UK can be cast in a rather different light. While no-one can predict exactly how the Bank of England will react, it clears away objections to an interest rate cut next month. The markets scrambled this morning to keep up, now back forecasting further rate cuts after February this year.",
      "UK inflation unexpectedly dips to 2.5% in December",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "However, there are two big uncertainties \u2013 whether President-elect Trump will bring in tariffs at the scale he has threatened, and how companies in the UK react to the forthcoming increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) in April and the rise in the minimum wage. A rise in energy prices which will hit bills is also predicted for April.",
      "Both tariffs and the forthcoming changes to NICs and the minimum wage may not end up being as problematic for the UK economy as some are warning.",
      "While some are expecting firms to raise prices as a result of the Budget changes, some companies may also choose to squeeze wages with lower-than-expected annual wage increases. The overall inflationary impact depends on how firms react and the truth is we don't know yet.",
      "Similarly Trump's tariffs are likely to be inflationary for the US and therefore affect US interest rates. But some at the Bank of England can see a scenario where cheaper tariff imports, for example from China, are diverted to the UK helping to rein in UK inflation.",
      "What actually happens is again uncertain but the outcome may be counterintuitive to what people expect.",
      "So the marginal fall in UK inflation can be seen as something of a firebreak, for now, popping something of the frothy hysteria seen over the past few weeks. Those shorting the UK on international markets will see that there is another side to this bet. UK inflation is in the middle of the G7 pack.",
      "That said, what has been called a global \"bond market tantrum\" remains in place, sensitive to every new piece of data. The UK government still has to convince on the detail of growth plans. It will mean fast-tracking infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies.",
      "Market borrowing rates remain at levels where the chancellor will probably need to course-correct spending plans with new cuts before Easter, in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "The shadow cast over inflationary prospects and so all markets by Donald Trump's unconventional trade policies looms large.",
      "The turbulence has not gone away. Inflation is likely to tick up again in the coming months. But right now headline and underlying inflation numbers in the UK all point in the right direction. It is a welcome safe harbour for now, but the seas remain choppy."

      "The Fed is widely expected to keep its key rate, which now stands at about 4.3%, unchanged at its meeting this month.",

      "Manufacturers will no longer be allowed to use the dye, called red No 3 or red dye 3, after studies linked it to cancer in male laboratory rats, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on Wednesday.",
      "While normal exposure to the dye is much lower in humans than in the rats in the studies, US law requires a ban if any link to cancer is found.",
      "The dye is used primarily in candy, cakes, cookies, frozen desserts and frosting as well as some medicines, the agency said.",
      "The ban is a result of a petition filed in 2022 by a number of groups, including the Center for Science in the Public Interest. They argued the dye should be barred due its links to cancer and its widespread use by US consumers, specifically children.",

    "story": [
      "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".",
      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid vacation per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

      "\"Weak leadership from a weak prime minister.\"",
      "In a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her.",
      "Siddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasury included tackling corruption in UK financial markets, was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh.",
      "Her aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year.",
      "Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",

      "He said the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\".",
      "This had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie.",
      "Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\".",
      "In the letter, Sir Laurie said: \"A lack of records and lapse of time has meant that, unfortunately, I have not been able to obtain comprehensive comfort in relation to all the UK property-related matters referred to in the media.",
      "\"However, I have not identified evidence of improprieties connected with the actions taken by Ms Siddiq and/or her husband in relation to their ownership or occupation of the London properties that have been the subject of press attention.",

      "Sir Laurie said Siddiq had \"explained the context\" of that visit as \"solely for the social purpose of joining family and enjoying the tourist access to the city facilitated as a result of her aunt's official visit as head of state\".",
      "He said Siddiq had been clear that she had \"no involvement in any inter-governmental discussions between Bangladesh and Russia or any form of official role\".",
      "\"I accept this at face value,\" he said, \"but should note that this visit may form part of investigations in Bangladesh.\"",
      "Sir Laurie added that Siddiq was a \"prominent member of one of the principal families involved in Bangladesh politics\" which had \"exposed her to allegations of misconduct by association\".",
      "\"Given the nature of Ms Siddiq's ministerial responsibilities... it is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks - both to her and the government - arising from her close family's association with Bangladesh,\" he said.",

      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "The chancellor was addressing the Commons following her return to the UK from a trip to China to drum up investment.",
      "During the debate, she accused Conservative critics of ignoring \"global volatility\" behind rising borrowing costs in other countries such as the US, Germany and France.",
      "\"The economic headwinds that we face are a reminder that we should, indeed we must, go further and faster in our plan to kick-start economic growth that plunged under the last government,\" she told MPs.",

      "\"You can't raise tough issues if you're not in the room,\" Reeves said.",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:27:55 GMT",
    "summary": "The measure is meant to help tackle the country's housing crisis, the prime minister said.",
    "story": [
      "Spain is planning to impose a tax of up to 100% on the value of properties bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK.",
      "Announcing the move, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the \"unprecedented\" measure was necessary to meet the country's housing emergency.",
      "\"The West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,\" he said.",
      "Non-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, he told an economic forum in Madrid, \"not to live in\" but \"to make money from them\".",
      "\"Which, in the context of shortage that we are in, [we] obviously cannot allow,\" he added.",
      "The move was designed to prioritise available homes for residents, the Spanish prime minister said.",
      "S\u00e1nchez did not provide any more details on how the tax would work nor a timeline for presenting it to parliament for approval, where he has often struggled to gather sufficient votes to pass legislation.",
      "His office described the proposed measure as a way to limit the purchase of homes by \"non-resident non-EU foreigners\". In Spain, people are classed as non-residents if they live in the country for less than 183 days in a single year.",
      "It added: \"The tax burden that they will have to pay in case of purchase will be increased up to 100% of the value of the property, in line with countries such as Denmark and Canada.\"",
      "The Spanish government said the proposal would be finalised \"after careful study\".",
      "The total number of sales to foreigners, including people from inside the EU, makes up around 15% of the Spanish housing market - that's 87,000 out of 583,000 sales in 2023 - according to the Spanish property registry.",
      "'Extreme proposal'",
      "Simon Creed of Azahar Properties, who has been selling homes in the Valencia region to Britons, Americans and other non-EU citizens for over 22 years, said the proposal had been the talk of property professionals in the area.",
      "Currently buyers in Valencia, non-residents and Spanish citizens alike, pay 10% transfer tax on the property's value. This figure varies with region.",
      "\"Naturally who wants to pay 100% purchase tax for buying a property here,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"The Brits have always been big buyers here in Spain, but obviously it is going to increase the buying power of EU citizens like the German, French and Belgians, so it doesn't appear to be very fair just to isolate non-EU buyers.\"",
      "He added: \"Something needs to happen to increase the amount of houses coming onto the market, but this is an extreme proposal.\"",
      "Antonio de la Fuente, managing director at Colliers International Spain, told BBC World Business Report he did not think 100% tax would solve the housing problem.",
      "\"We all agree we are in a problem of not enough supply and we need to produce new supply to give people migrating from other parts of Spain to big cities like Madrid, Valencia, [and] Malaga a new home.",
      "\"But this will be a drop in the ocean in my opinion and there will be other alternatives that will have a higher impact on the housing market.\"",
      "'I'll be looking at Cyprus instead'",
      "Prospective British buyers told BBC News the proposal had made them think again about buying in Spain.",
      "Michele Hayes, from Manchester, who spent the weekend house-hunting south of Alicante, had wanted a property for family to visit and to spend time during her retirement.",
      "\"We could look at buying quickly before the tax comes in, but we don't know what could happen in the future,\" she said.",
      "\"Selling could be tough if we can no longer sell to non-residents, especially a holiday home property in a touristy area.\"",
      "The 59-year-old said she empathised with their housing issue, but said she wanted to add to the local economy and asked: \"How many working Spanish people want to live in holiday homes in these tourist areas anyway?\"",
      "Martin Craven, from London, said he had been looking to buy in Spain this year.",
      "\"I definitely wouldn't consider trying to get in before this tax, because who knows what else they could do,  a retrospective tax or a tax on existing owners,\" the 62-year-old said.",
      "\"I'll be looking at Cyprus now instead.\"",
      "Julian, 54, from Surrey, said Spain was his first choice to buy a holiday home, but now it \"looks more risky\" than other countries.",
      "\"I would want to be out there four to six months a year, also travelling, spending money, buying food and drink, paying taxes,\" the 54-year-old said.",
      "\"Here in the UK, we also have problems with landlords buying multiple properties and driving up the rest, but this policy is losing sight of those of us who want to spend money in the country. \"",

      "Ms Saddiq ran three Post Offices in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, but \"lost everything\" and had to move away from the area where she lived after she was assaulted in street.",

      "He said the amount of compensation being paid out had doubled in the last six months and the government was trying to make the compensation schemes \"less legalistic, less adversarial\".",
      "Claimants can choose to take a \u00a375,000 fixed sum compensation and avoid a lengthy assessment process, which should help the claims be processed more quickly, he added."

      "Borrowing costs are rising for many countries across the world, but some have argued that decisions made in the Budget appear to have made the UK more vulnerable.",
      "The Conservatives said the chancellor was \"hanging on by her fingernails\".",
      "When asked at a press conference earlier whether Reeves would remain chancellor for the whole of the Parliament, the prime minister declined to answer, but did then say she had his \"full confidence\" and was doing a \"fantastic job\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The prime minister just refused to back his chancellor staying in her job.",
      "\"The markets are in turmoil and business confidence has crashed, yet the chancellor is nowhere to be seen.\"",
      "However, the prime minister's official spokesman later said: \"You heard from the prime minister this morning.",
      "\"He was very explicit (that) he has full confidence in the chancellor and he'll be working with her in the role of chancellor for the whole of this Parliament.\"",
      "The row comes after the chancellor defended her decision to travel to China to improve economic ties with the country, despite the uncertainty in the financial markets.",
      "The Conservatives said she had \"fled to China\", but Reeves said agreements reached in Beijing would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.",
      "Reeves is a central figure in the Labour government, presented to the voters as a safe pair of hands in the run-up to the election. She also led the work to build bridges with business.",
      "But business and some other observers were shaken by her first Budget in October, which they fear could knock the wind from the economy further, rather than spur the growth Labour has promised.",
      "Market jitters over the past week have increased concerns over the government's economic strategy.",
      "Rising borrowing costs will have a knock-on effect on the government's tax and spending plans, because it will have to pay more interest to finance its existing debt. That leaves less to spend on public services and investment.",
      "Trump factor",
      "Governments generally borrow money by selling bonds to big investors, such as pension funds. UK government bonds are known as gilts.",
      "The yield on the 10-year gilt - the interest rate at which the government pays back a decade-long loan to investors - rose to 4.88% on Monday, its highest level for 17 years.",
      "The 30-year gilt yield climbed to 5.44%, its highest in 27 years.",
      "Government debt costs in Germany, France, Spain and Italy also rose on Monday.",
      "Some experts say investors are reacting to the re-election of former US President Donald Trump and his talk of tariffs.",
      "There is concern this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought, and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected, both in the US and elsewhere.",
      "Strong US jobs data released on Friday added to expectations that US rates will stay higher for longer, and this has helped to strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies.",
      "However, Emma Wall, head of platform investors at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the UK's problems were not purely caused by global issues, arguing that measures announced in the Budget have stoked inflation.",
      "\"If you can get inflation under control, you will see interest rates come down in the UK,\" she added.",
      "Reeves also faced questions over her self-imposed rules on government debt and spending, which she said on Saturday were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "Despite her commitment, some have questioned whether she will be able to achieve the targets without making further spending cuts or tax rises because of how government debt costs have risen.",
      "On Monday, Sir Keir said the government was going to keep to its fiscal rules.",
      "However, he added that the government would be \"ruthless\" in its decisions for the upcoming spending review.",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Reeves faces 'difficult decisions' on tax and spending",
      "Confidence 'bruised'",
      "The government has made growing the UK's economy a key objective, but recent figures indicate the economy saw zero growth between July and September, while it contracted during October.",
      "Businesses have warned that Budget measures, such as the rise in employer National Insurance contributions, together with the higher National Living Wage could lead to job cuts and price rises.",
      "Rupert Soames, chair of the Confederation of British Business (CBI), said the picture was \"not good\" but insisted that firms were still somewhat upbeat.",
      "\"I wouldn't say confidence is gone,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"I'd say it's bruised.\"",
      "However, he said the government was making the situation worse by introducing the Employment Rights Bill, which he said contained \"powerful dissuaders to employment\".",
      "Unions argue the protections introduced in the bill, such as banning fire-and-rehire, make employees safer, while the government has said it \"represents the biggest upgrade in employment rights for a generation\".",
      "However, Mr Soames said the bill would lead to job losses.",
      "\"Businesses will not only not employ, they will let people go,\" he said.",
      "As part of its push for growth, the government revealed plans on Monday to make the UK the global capital of artificial intelligence through measures such as building a new supercomputer.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "But shadow science secretary Alan Mak said Labour was \"delivering analogue government in a digital age\".",
      "While the push towards AI is seen as way of cutting down on public spending, Mak accused Labour of undermining this goal with its economic policies.",
      "\"Labour's economic mismanagement and uninspiring plan will mean Britain is left behind,\" he said.",
      "Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle told the BBC there was no reason why the UK could not create tech companies on the same scale as Google, Amazon, and Apple.",
      "\"At the moment, we don't have any frontier conceptual, cutting-edge companies that are British-owned.\"",
      "He highlighted DeepMind, which created technology enabling computers to play video and board games, as an example of a former British-born company that was now US-owned.",
      "It was founded by three University College London students before its acquisition by Google.",
      "Tim Flagg, chief operating officer of UKAI - a trade body representing British AI businesses - said the proposals take a \"narrow view\" of the sector's contributors and focus too much on big tech.",
      "\"AI innovation spans industries, from small enterprises to non-tech sectors, all driving the new industrial revolution,\" he said.",
      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",
      "There are continuing questions over the risks of introducing AI systems that can \"hallucinate\" or make things up, or discriminate against certain groups of people due to bias.",

    "summary": "Workers making clothes for the fast fashion giant tell the BBC they labour for up to 75 hours a week.",
    "story": [
      "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.",
      "It rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.",
      "This is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer.",
      "\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC.",
      "Most said they only have one day off a month.",
      "The BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers.",
      "We found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.",
      "These hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.",
      "But they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years.",
      "Still privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "Its meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour.",
      "Last year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.",
      "The company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.",
      "It added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"",
      "Shein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average.",
      "Revenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.",
      "The buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.",
      "As the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.",
      "But even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.",
      "\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"",
      "She is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.",
      "They are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.",
      "This is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.",
      "The migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.",
      "\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.",
      "\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"",
      "Examining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.",
      "The alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.",
      "Standard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found.",
      "This is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein.",
      "They found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floor Wage Alliance says is needed for a \"living wage\". But the workers we spoke to managed to earn anywhere between 4,000 and 10,000 yuan a month.",
      "\"These hours are not unusual, but it's clear that it's illegal and it violates basic human rights,\" said David Hachfield from the group. \"It's an extreme form of exploitation and this needs to be visible.\"",
      "The average working week should not exceed 44 hours, according to Chinese labour laws, which also state that employers should ensure workers have at least one rest day a week. If an employer wants to extend these hours, it should be for special reasons.",
      "While Shein's headquarters are now in Singapore, there is no denying the majority of its products are made in China.",
      "And Shein's success has drawn the attention of Washington, which is increasingly wary of Chinese firms.",
      "In June, Donald Trump's pick for US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said he had  \"grave ethics concerns\" about Shein's \"deep ties to the People's Republic of China\": \"Slave labour, sweatshops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind Shein's success,\" he wrote.",
      "Not everyone would agree with Rubio's choice of words to describe the conditions at Shein's suppliers. But rights groups say that the long working hours, which have become a way of life for many in Guangzhou, are unfair and exploitative.",
      "The machines dictate the rhythm of the day.",
      "They pause for lunch and dinner when the workers, metal plates and chopsticks in hand, file into the canteen to buy food. If there is no more space to sit, they stand in the street.",
      "\"I've been working in these factories for more than 40 years,\" said one woman who spent just 20 minutes eating her meal. This was just another day for her.",
      "Inside, the factories we visit are not cramped. There is enough light and industrial-sized fans have been brought in to keep workers cool. Huge posters urge staff to report underage workers - likely a response to finding two cases of child labour in the supply chain last year.",
      "The BBC understands that the company is keeping a closer eye on its suppliers ahead of plans to go public on the London Stock Exchange.",
      "\"This is about their reputation,\" says Sheng Lu, a professor in Fashion and Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware. \"If Shein can successfully achieve an IPO then it means they are recognised as a decent company. But if they are to keep the confidence of investors, they have to take some responsibility.\"",
      "One of the biggest challenges Shein faces is accusations that it sources cotton from China's Xinjiang region.",
      "Once touted as among the world's best fabric, Xinjiang's cotton has fallen out of favour after allegations that it is produced using forced labour by people from the Muslim Uyghur minority - a charge that Beijing has consistently denied.",
      "The only way to get around this criticism is to be more transparent, Prof Sheng says.",
      "\"Unless you fully release your factory list, unless you make your supply chain more transparent to the public, then I think it's going to be very challenging for Shein.\"",
      "A major advantage, he adds, is that Shein's supply chain is in China: \"Very few countries have a complete supply chain. China has this - and nobody can compete.\"",
      "Aspiring rivals like Vietnam and Bangladesh import raw materials from China to make clothes. But Chinese factories rely entirely on local sources for everything, from fabric to zippers and buttons. So it's easy to make a variety of garments, and they are able to do it quickly.",
      "That especially works for Shein whose algorithm determines orders. If shoppers repeatedly click on a certain dress, or spend longer looking at a wool sweater, the firm knows to ask factories to make more - and fast.",
      "For workers in Guangzhou, this can be a challenge.",
      "\"Shein has its pros and cons,\" one factory owner told us. \"The good thing is the order is eventually big, but profit is low and it's fixed.\"",
      "Shein, given its size and influence, is a hard bargainer. So factory owners have to cut costs elsewhere, often resulting in lower staff wages.",
      "\"Before Shein, we produced and sold clothes on our own,\" said an owner of three factories. \"We could estimate the cost, decide the price  and calculate the profit. Now Shein controls the price, and you have to think about ways to reduce the cost.\"",
      "When orders peak, however, it's a bonanza. The company ships around one million packages a day on average, according to data from ShipMatrix, a logistics consultancy firm.",
      "\"Shein is a pillar of the fashion industry,\" said Guo Qing E, a Shein supplier.",
      "\"I started when Shein started. I witnessed its rise. To be honest, Shein is an awesome company in China. I think it will become stronger, because it pays on time. This is where it is most trustworthy.",
      "\"If payment for our goods is due on the 15th, no matter whether it's millions or tens of millions, the money will be paid on time.\"",
      "Shein, with its gruelling hours and sometimes lower wages, may not be a source of comfort to all its workers. But it is a source of pride for some.",
      "\"This is the contribution we Chinese people can make to the world,\" said a 33- year-old supervisor from Guangdong, who didn't want to give her name.",
      "It's dark outside and workers are filing back into factories after their dinner for the final stretch. She admits the hours are long, but \"we get on well with each other. We are like a family\".",
      "Hours later, after many workers head home for the night, the lights in several buildings stay on.",
      "Some people work until midnight, one factory owner told us. They want to earn more money, he said.",

      "Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.",
      "\u201cUsually when I\u2019m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,\u201d she says. \u201cThis now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.\u201d",
      "She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her \u201ctwo to three minutes per consultation, if not more\u201d. She reels off other benefits: \u201cIt reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.\"",
      "With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.",
      "A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015, according to the British Medical Association (BMA).",
      "Could AI be the solution to help GP\u2019s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?",
      "Some research suggests it could. A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.",
      "Meanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.",
      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",

      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",

      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",

      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",

      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:56:14 GMT",
    "summary": "Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan have been announced as the three new presenters of the show.",
    "story": [
      "After 60 years, Match of the Day is abandoning its sole presenter format and taking on three people who will, in turn, host the show. It is a departure, but it is far from a new strategy in TV.",
      "Match of the Day has, extraordinarily, had just five main presenters in its history - with Gary Lineker being in the hot seat for the past 26 years.",
      "His replacements, who will take over the BBC One football highlights show next season, are all broadcasters rather than sports stars who have taken up broadcasting as a second career.",
      "Lineker and, before him in the 70s and 80s, Jimmy Hill, were examples of former players who were comfortable taking the lead in the studio, but they were more an exception than a rule when it comes to hosting sports programmes.",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "New Match of the Day presenters announced",
      "There was speculation that footballer-turned-broadcaster Alex Scott would take over the show - but in the end, the names in the press release are all stalwarts of decades of live broadcasting.",
      "The person who might be less familiar to the BBC TV audience is Kelly Cates. But the daughter of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish has 26 years' experience of live TV and radio on Sky and 5 Live. She knows football and she knows television.",
      "Likewise, Gabby Logan has been presenting for 30 years. And Mark Chapman has 29 years under his belt and is already the face of Match of the Day 2 on Sundays.",
      "By choosing three new hosts, the BBC is following a pattern in TV where a brand or format becomes less associated with a single name.",
      "When Richard Osman decided to leave Pointless, six people were named as his replacements for the daily show (and another eight for the series after that).",
      "Angus Deayton's presenting role on Have I Got News For You became an ever-changing roster of weekly visitors to the presenting chair.",
      "The One Show may have a core of four main presenters, but the list of people who have over the years done a stint on the green sofa is a long one.",
      "Match of the Day has now been handed over to some very safe hands.",
      "And based on their track records, none of them look likely to attract the sorts of headlines that Lineker has had in recent years.",
      "There is good reason to be careful. At a time when TV ratings have been falling year after year, Match of the Day has been holding steady.",
      "In an era when every Premier League match is televised somewhere and social media is awash with clips of goals as soon as they happen, there was always a question about whether anyone would still want to watch a highlights show.",
      "However, over the past five years, Match of the Day's audience of just under 3.5 million has remained almost unchanged. Over a season, the BBC says 33 million people will tune in at some time to one of the Match of the Day programmes.",
      "The resilience of Match of the Day has not gone unnoticed, and with the current rights deal due to continue until the 2028/29 season, this is a brand the BBC hopes to grow.",
      "There have been reports that the corporation will use the shake-up as an opportunity to use the MOTD name more widely on its online platforms.",
      "Given that the BBC has struggled to compete in an era of rapidly escalating costs for sports rights, it dearly wants to hang on to an audience that may not consume at lot of the rest of the BBC's output.",
      "There is also a good reason the Premier League wants the highlights programme to succeed - about half of the league's domestic TV audience see their football only on the BBC.",
      "It is a shop window that helps keep top flight football central to the national conversation.",

    "summary": "The rapper withdraws a case accusing his label of artificially boosting the success of Not Like Us.",
    "story": [
      "Rap superstar Drake is suing Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of the Kendrick Lamar diss track Not Like Us last year.",
      "The song, which formed part of a furious back and forth between the two stars, accused Drake and his entourage of being \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "Universal has yet to respond to the allegations.",
      "The move comes just 24 hours after Drake withdrew a separate legal action against UMG and Spotify,  in which he accused the two companies of conspiring to artificially boost streams of Not Like Us, at the expense of his own music.",
      "In that case, he argued that Universal had licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to generate extra plays, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".",
      "In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.\"",
      "It added that \"no amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments... can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\".",
      "The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\".",
      "His lawyers withdrew the case on Tuesday, after meeting with representatives from both companies, according to court papers.",

      "Drake takes legal action over song's 'sex offender' claim",
      "The feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar explained",
      "That appeared to draw a line under the legal action - until the story took a dramatic twist on Wednesday morning.",
      "In a lawsuit filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of prioritising \"corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists\".",
      "His lawyers noted that the artwork for Not Like Us was based on an aerial photograph of Drake's $100m Toronto mansion, dotted with red markers that are often used to represent the presence of registered sex offenders.",
      "The court documents link that artwork to a shooting at the property shortly after the release of Kendrick's song, calling it \"the 2024 equivalent of 'Pizzagate'\".",
      "The comment referenced a conspiracy theory about a US child sex ring operating out of a Washington pizza restaurant, which led to a gunman opening fire on the eaterie in 2016.",
      "Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s.",
      "In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent.",
      "However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify.",
      "The song is nominated for five prizes, including record and song of the year, at the Grammy Awards on 3 February. A week later, Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "However, the new lawsuit is not aimed at Lamar himself, according to Drake's lawyers.",
      "\"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created Not Like Us,\" the court documents says.",
      "\"It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\""

      "On Tuesday, in a blog post titled Breaking The Silence, Gaiman said he had read the allegations with \"horror and dismay\".",
      "He wrote: \"I've stayed quiet until now, both out of respect for the people who were sharing their stories and out of a desire not to draw even more attention to a lot of misinformation.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 15:00:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Anne, 53, was subject to nationwide ridicule after a TV show revealed how she paid out huge sums to romance scammers pretending to be Brad Pitt.",
    "story": [
      "A French woman who was conned out of \u20ac830,000 (\u00a3700,000; $850,000) by scammers posing as actor Brad Pitt has faced a huge wave of mockery, leading French broadcaster TF1 to withdraw a programme about her.",
      "The primetime programme, which aired on Sunday, attracted national attention on interior designer Anne, 53, who thought she was in a relationship with Pitt for a year and a half.",
      "She has since told a popular French YouTube show that she was not \"crazy or a moron\": \"I just got played, I admit it, and that's why I came forward, because I am not the only one.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt told US outlet Entertainment Weekly that it was \"awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities\" and that people shouldn't respond to unsolicited online outreach \"especially from actors who have no social media presence.\"",
      "Hundreds of social media users mocked Anne, who the programme said had lost her life's savings and tried to take her own life three times since the scam came to light.",
      "Netflix France put out a post on X advertising \"four films with Brad Pitt (for real)\", while, in a now-deleted post, Toulouse FC said: \"Hi Anne, Brad told us he would be at the stadium on Wednesday... and you?\"",
      "The club has since apologised for the post.",
      "On Tuesday, TF1 said it had pulled the segment on Anne after her testimony had sparked \"a wave of harassment\" - although the programme can still be found online.",
      "In the report, Anne said her ordeal began when she downloaded Instagram in February 2023, when she was still married to a wealthy entrepreneur.",
      "She was immediately contacted by someone who said they were Pitt's mother, Jane Etta, who told Anne her son \"needed a woman just like her\".",
      "Somebody purporting to be Pitt got in touch the next day, which set off alarm bells for Anne. \"But as someone who isn't very used to social media, I didn't really know what was happening to me,\" she said.",
      "At one point, \"Brad Pitt\" said he tried to send her luxury gifts but that he was unable to pay customs on them as his bank accounts were frozen due to his divorce proceedings with actor Angelina Jolie, prompting Anne to transfer \u20ac9000 to the scammers.",
      "\"Like a fool, I paid... Every time I doubted him, he managed to dissipate my doubts,\" she said.",
      "The requests for money ramped up when the fake Pitt told Anne he needed cash to pay for kidney cancer treatment, sending her multiple AI-generated photos of Brad Pitt in a hospital bed. \"I looked those photos up on the internet but couldn't find them so I thought that meant he had taken those selfies just for me,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Anne and her husband divorced, and she was awarded \u20ac775,000 - all of which went to the scammers.",
      "\"I told myself I was maybe saving a man's life,\" Anne said, who is in cancer remission herself.",
      "Anne's daughter, now 22, told TF1 she tried to \"get her mother to see reason\" for over a year but that her mother was too excited. \"It hurt to see how naive she was being,\" she said.",
      "When images appeared in gossip magazines showing the real Brad Pitt with his new girlfriend Ines de Ramon, awakening suspicions in Anne, the scammers sent her an fake news report in which the AI-generated anchor talked about Pitt's \"exclusive relationship with one special individual... who goes by the name of Anne.\"",
      "The video comforted Anne for a short time, but when the real Brad Pitt and Ines de Ramon made their relationship official in June 2024, Anne decided to end things.",
      "After scammers tried to get more money out of her under the guise of \"Special FBI Agent John Smith,\" Anne contacted the police. An investigation is now under way.",
      "The TF1 programme said the events left Anne broke, and that she has tried to end her life three times.",
      "\"Why was I chosen to be hurt this way?,\" a tearful Anne said. \"These people deserve hell. We need to find those scammers, I beg you - please help me find them.\"",
      "But in the YouTube interview on Tuesday Anne hit back at TF1, saying it had left out details on her repeated doubts over whether she was talking to the real Brad Pitt, and added that anyone could've fallen for the scam if they were told \"words that you never heard from your own husband.\"",
      "Anne said she was now living with a friend: \"My whole life is a small room with some boxes. That's all I have left.\"",
      "While many online users overwhelmingly mocked Anne, several took her side.",
      "\"I understand the comic effect but we're talking about a woman in her 50s who got conned by deepfakes and AI which your parents and grandparents would be incapable to spot,\" one popular post on X read.",
      "An op-ed in newspaper Lib\u00e9ration said Anne was a \"whistleblower\": \"Life today is paved with cybertraps... and AI progress will only worsen this scenario.\""

      "\"I think what's interesting is although we're sharing the role, we won't actually be working together on Match of the Day,\" she said.",
      "\"It's really great to share it because we bring different experiences and different interests within the game. We bring different ways of broadcasting and that will mean our pundits are kept on their toes and share different kinds of analysis.\"",

      "\"People might find this hard to believe but there's absolutely no competition between the three of us,\" he said.",
      "\"We'll do a mix of everything that works for us all as individuals, and all of us are really keen that it's fair.",

      "On first MOTD memories",
      "\"Match of the Day was always on - I can't remember a time without it,\" said Cates, who is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Sir Kenny Dalglish.",
      "\"My earliest memory is of Des Lynam being on it. In fact there's a Scottish version of Match of the Day and I was born just before it came on air, so my dad had time to get home and watch it in the evening. I've always had a good sense of timing when it comes to an evening highlights show!\"",
      "Logan, who is the daughter of former Wales and Leeds midfielder Terry Yorath, said: \"When my dad was playing, it was the only way you could watch football on TV because there were very few live matches.",
      "\"That music would play every Saturday night because he would come home from work - playing in a match - and watch his match on Match of the Day. As a very little girl, hearing that music meant I was staying up late on a Saturday night.\"",
      "Chapman said: \"My first memory of Match of the Day was in 1981 watching Manchester United play Ipswich at Old Trafford in the era when not every game was shown on the programme.",
      "\"I remember Gary Bailey being in goal for Manchester United and saving a penalty with no gloves on. I wanted to go and get in goal in the garden after that. I must have been seven.\"",

      "Look back at the first time Gary Lineker presented Match of the Day",

      "\"It's something that's so well-loved and so well-respected you don't want to be the person that goes in and breaks that,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm just very excited, I can't wait to get started. I keep thinking about that moment I'll be sitting in the chair and the music starts, and I can't wait for it to happen.\"",
      "Chapman said \"in many ways I'm not doing anything different to what I've done for the last 12 years\".",
      "But he added: \"I am excited about the variety that is going to come from the new role.",
      "\"I just can't wait to be working with two friends, where we've grown up working together and we feel like a team. And to have some Sundays off.\"",
      "Logan - a rhythmic gymnast for Great Britain before going into broadcasting - described it as an \"iconic show\".",
      "She added: \"One of the first things I did when I came to the BBC was fill in on Match of the Day and at that point when I was in that chair at the old BBC studio in London and hearing the music, it was a real hairs-on-the-back-of-the-neck moment.",
      "\"It's always a real moment [sitting in the chair] because it has such history and it's still so relevant to so many people now and talked about in a landscape where TV has changed so much.",
      "\"Everybody understands the history of the programme and the consistently huge audiences that watch it. It has more to offer as well - we know how strong the digital offering is and Match of the Day is really relevant to that audience too.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 09:32:54 GMT",
    "summary": "A new Sky series on the 1988 disaster has again put the spotlight on the case, which has divided opinion for decades.",
    "story": [
      "The first of two TV dramas on the Lockerbie disaster to be broadcast this year will, for many people, be their first glimpse into this labyrinth of a case.",
      "Based on a book by the father of one of the victims, Lockerbie: A Search for Truth focuses on longstanding claims that the only man found guilty of bombing Pan Am 103 was innocent.",
      "The production - which has provoked fierce criticism from relatives of American victims - does not mention that the conviction of Abdulbasset Al Megrahi for murdering 270 people was upheld twice on appeal.",
      "Each episode of the Sky Atlantic series starts with a declaration that it's \"inspired by the work and research\" of Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was on board Pan Am 103 when it broke apart over Lockerbie in December 1988.",
      "Flora Swire was one of 259 passengers and crew who were killed along with 11 residents in Lockerbie when the wreckage destroyed their homes.",
      "Lockerbie bombing: The ultimate detective story?",
      "Lockerbie dad delighted by Colin Firth portrayal",
      "Lockerbie suspect 'is the bomber' - MacAskill",
      "In 2001, after an eight-month trial, Scottish judges convicted Megrahi of bombing the plane while acting with other members of the Libyan intelligence service.",
      "For more than 20 years, Jim Swire and his supporters have argued that Megrahi and Libya were framed for political expediency.",
      "They believe the real culprits were Iran and a Syrian-backed group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command (PFLP-GC).",
      "Relatives of other victims dismiss that as a baseless conspiracy theory.",
      "Later this year, the case will be examined all over again when another Libyan suspect goes on trial in Washington, accused of building the Lockerbie bomb.",
      "The warnings before the bombing",
      "The controversy over Lockerbie began within days of the tragedy on 21 December 1988.",
      "As the drama recounts, it soon emerged that there had been warnings that a bomb attack on a Pan Am flight was imminent.",
      "Those warnings had not been made public.  The passengers, including a CIA agent, boarded Pan Am 103 without knowing anything about them.",
      "The US president Ronald Reagan said afterwards: \"Such a public statement with nothing more to go on than an anonymous phone call, you would literally have closed down the air traffic in the world.\"",
      "In a BBC documentary in 2008, the government official who took that call at the US embassy in Helsinki described it as a hoax and a \"horrible coincidence\".",
      "But for 36 years, Dr Swire and other UK relatives have called for a public inquiry to examine the warnings and the failures of airline and airport security which allowed the bomb to slip through. As the drama points out, this inquiry has never happened.",
      "Just last week, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said he could not consider the request while the judicial process in the US was still going on.",
      "The destruction of Pan Am 103 was an attack on the United States. Of the 270 victims, 190 were American. The rest came from 20 other countries, including 43 people from the UK.",
      "Suspicion initially fell on Iran.",
      "Five months before Lockerbie, an American warship shot down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf after mistaking it for a fighter jet. The 290 men, women and children on board were killed. Iran swore revenge.",
      "In October that year, West German police raided flats in Frankfurt where members of the PFLP-GC were preparing bombs in radio cassette players. They had timetables for airlines, including Pan Am.",
      "Less than two months later, Pan Am 103 was brought down.",
      "A joint Scottish/US investigation established that the bomb had been concealed inside a different model of radio cassette player in a suitcase.",
      "The involvement of the PFLP-GC and Iran made sense, but Scottish police and the FBI say they found no evidence to justify charges against anyone from the group or Iranian officials.",
      "The defence at the Lockerbie trial blamed the Palestinians for the bombing but the judges said they had heard nothing to prove their involvement or undermine their belief that Libya was responsible.",
      "The prosecution case was that the Libyans smuggled the unaccompanied suitcase onto an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt, where it was loaded on to Pan Am 103a, the feeder flight for Pan Am 103. This assertion was supported by baggage records.",
      "The suitcase was transferred onto Pan Am 103 at Heathrow.",
      "Clothes from the suitcase were traced to a shop on Malta. Its owner told the court they were bought by a Libyan who resembled Megrahi, a crucial piece of evidence which has been hotly disputed ever since.",
      "The day before the bombing, Megrahi travelled to Malta using a false passport supplied by the Libyan intelligence service.",
      "He was at Malta airport when luggage was being loaded onto the flight to Frankfurt and flew back to Libya shortly afterwards.  He never used the passport again and later denied being on Malta.",
      "Dr Swire and his supporters remain convinced the US needed to shift the blame from Iran, which was backing groups holding American hostages.",
      "The prosecution did not need to prove a motive at the Lockerbie trial but there was a long history of antagonism between the US and Libya. This culminated in 1986 with the bombing of a Berlin nightclub, which killed two American servicemen, and a retaliatory raid by the US airforce on Tripoli and Benghazi.",
      "That attack killed dozens of people including, it was claimed, the adopted daughter of Libyan leader Muanmar Gaddafi.",
      "Megrahi lost his first appeal against his conviction in 2002 but won a second after a four-year investigation by the independent Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission.",
      "The SCCRC found there was no proper basis in allegations that investigators had manipulated, altered or fabricated evidence to make a case against Megrahi.",
      "But it did conclude the court had no reasonable basis for finding that Megrahi bought the clothes in Malta, undermining a cornerstone of the prosecution case.",
      "The commission said the verdict had been \"unreasonable\" and that Megrahi might have suffered a miscarriage of justice.",
      "The case was sent back to the courts but Megrahi abandoned the appeal after he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.",
      "Terminally ill, he was freed on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 and died three years later in Tripoli.",
      "In 2020, after a request from Megrahi's family, the SCCRC referred the case back to the appeal court a second time.",
      "Once again, the commission said the trial court should not have accepted that Megrahi bought the clothes that were beside the bomb.",
      "It also said he was denied a fair trial because of non-disclosure; the prosecution didn't give the defence certain information which could have helped him.",
      "Five of Scotland's most senior judges upheld the conviction, saying the identification of Megrahi was just one part of the overall picture and the information which was not disclosed to the defence would not have changed the verdict.",
      "The bomb timer fragment",
      "The single most important piece of evidence from the case was a thumbnail-sized fragment of circuit board, found embedded in the neck band of a shirt from the suitcase that held the bomb.",
      "The trial judges accepted evidence from scientists that it was part of an MST-13 bomb timer sold to Libya by MEBO, a Swiss firm with connections to Megrahi.",
      "Towards the end of the Sky drama, Dr Swire becomes even more convinced of Megrahi's innocence after learning that tests on the fragment showed it had a different coating from the MST-13 timers obtained by Libya.",
      "This evidence was examined by the SCCRC before it sent Megrahi's conviction back to the appeal court in 2020.",
      "It said it was \"not persuaded\" that it called into question the judges' conclusion that the fragment came from an MST-13 timer which triggered the bomb.",
      "The drama tells viewers that the British government used public interest immunity certificates to prevent the disclosure of \"secret intelligence documents allegedly implicating Iran and the PLFP-GC\" and that those documents \"remain classified to this day\".",
      "The certificates were imposed in 2008 and again in 2020, when the UK's foreign secretary said their disclosure would harm the UK's international relations and damage counter-terrorism liason and intelligence gathering.",
      "An independent investigator from the SCCRC was allowed to view the two documents in 2006 and concluded that the prosecution's failure to disclose one of them to the defence might have resulted in a miscarriage of justice.",
      "The matter wasn't dealt with in court because Megrahi abandoned his second appeal.",
      "In 2019, the SCCRC looked at them again. This time it decided one of the documents involved inadmissable hearsay and the second would not have made any difference to the defence, had it known about it.",
      "The appeal court accepted the SCCRC's views and the government's argument that disclosure could harm national security.",
      "The Sky drama informs its audience that some names, scenes and characters have been \"changed or fictionalised for dramatic purposes\".",
      "There are examples of that throughout, including its portrayal of the day of the verdicts at the Lockerbie trial.",
      "Megrahi stood trial alongside another Libyan, Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, at Camp Zeist - a specially convened Scottish court in the Netherlands.",
      "The programme ramps up the tension as the judges announce they have found Fhimah not guilty and Megrahi guilty. This prompts jubilation among almost all of the relatives in the court's public gallery, with people leaping to their feet and hugging each other.",
      "A distressed young Libyan woman bangs on a glass partition shouting \"That's my dad!\" as a bewildered Megrahi is sentenced to life in a Scottish prison.",
      "Played by Colin Firth, Dr Swire faints and falls to the floor.",
      "In real life, the judges announced the verdict the other way round. There were gasps and tears but no outbursts of emotion; the atmosphere remained sombre; Megrahi was impassive; no-one banged on the glass.",
      "In a shocking and unforgettable moment, Dr Swire did faint and had to be carried from the courtroom. The sentence was announced later that day.",
      "A group representing relatives of some of the American victims has criticised the Sky drama.",
      "Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 said it \"amplifies falsehoods and unsupported theories; ignores the work of hundreds of family members by focusing on one; disregards the work of investigators and prosecutors; and brings to life, in grotesque detail, the events of 21 December 1988\".",
      "The group continued: \"Worst of all, the series presents a convicted murderer as an innocent man that should be empathized with.\"",
      "Sky said it understood that there were \"opposing opinions\" and that the series did not attempt to tell the definitive version of the Lockerbie disaster or present a conclusion.",
      "\"We do not underestimate the responsibility of telling this story sensitively,\" it added.",
      "\"We engaged with victims' families and support groups throughout production and in the lead up to the series launch.\"",
      "Dr Swire said he hoped the series would cause people to \"have another look at the criminal investigation after Lockerbie.",
      "\"I would like to know the whole truth about my daughter's brutal murder along with those of 269 other people.\"",
      "The second Lockerbie trial",
      "Scotland's Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said the trial had found that the bombing was orchestrated by the Libyan government and that multiple individuals were involved.",
      "\"Megrahi was found guilty and two appeals have upheld that conviction,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Scottish prosecutors are working with their US counterparts to support the current prosecution. The trial in Washington will bring the facts before the public again and the circumstances of what happened can be fully understood.\"",
      "In May, a Libyan man in his 70s will stand trial in Washington, accused of the destruction of a civil aircraft resulting in death.",
      "Abu Agila Masud has denied building the bomb which destroyed Pan Am 103 in a Libyan intelligence operation involving Megrahi and Fhimah.",
      "Prosecutors in Washington are likely to lead evidence from the first trial along with new information gathered in the years that followed.",
      "The defence will be armed with all the counter arguments from Megrahi's legal teams and the SCCRC's doubts over the safety of his conviction.",
      "In addition to the Sky series, a BBC/Netflix drama on Lockerbie is also due to be screened later this year, focusing on the joint Scottish/US investigation.",
      "More than 36 years after the tragedy, the controversy surrounding the deadliest terror attack in British history shows no sign of fading away.",
      "David Cowan and presenter Kaye Adams, who reported from Lockerbie on the night of the disaster, will discuss the story with Martin Geissler on BBC News Scotland's new podcast, Scotcast. The episode will be available on BBC Sounds at 17:00 on Wednesday and broadcast on the BBC Scotland channel at 23:00."

      "Murray wrote: \"Really sad news about Tony Slattery. Such a dazzling talent,\" while Herring simply posted: \"Oh, Tony.\"",

      "Another comedian, Arthur Smith wrote: \"RIP Tony Slattery. Brilliant quick wit, kind, thoughtful.\" Performer Tom Walker aka Jonathan Pie added: \"Absolutely heartbreaking to hear about Tony Slattery. A genius.\"",
      "Comedian and writer David Baddiel described the news as \"so sad\", while presenter and actor Les Dennis remembered Slattery as a \"wonderful talent and a nice man\".",
      "Born into a working class family in North London in 1959, Slattery won a scholarship to study medieval and modern languages at Cambridge University.",
      "It was from here that he entered the world of showbiz, meeting a young Sir Stephen, who invited him to join the Cambridge Footlights - the university's famous amateur dramatics club.",
      "From then on, Slattery once said: \"Getting up on stage and hearing laughter took over.\"",
      "At Cambridge, he was also a contemporary of Dame Emma Thompson and Hugh Laurie.",
      "In 1981, the group won the inaugural Perrier Comedy Award at the Edinburgh Festival, for their production of The Cellar Tapes.",

      "He made several TV appearances, including a stint hosting children's programme TX.",
      "But his big break came in 1986, when he landed a starring role in the West End musical Me and My Girl; before going on to appear in Radio Times, Privates on Parade and Neville's Island \u2013 to critical acclaim.",
      "His other on screen credits include To Die For, Up 'N Under and The Wedding Tackle.",
      "But he will be most fondly remembered for his work on Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Channel 4's flagship comedy show which saw performers conduct a series of short improvisation games, creating comedic scenes from suggestions made by the host or the audience.",
      "Slattery tickled the nation, appearing alongside the likes of fellow Comedy Store Players members Paul Merton, Josie Lawrence and Sandi Toksvig, as well as Rory Bremner and Sir Stephen, in 48 episodes from 1988 to 1995.",

      "He admitted himself to hospital on several occasions.",
      "Once, he locked himself in his flat for six months and threw all of his furniture into the Thames.",

    "story": [
      "Linda Nolan and her singing sisters lived in the spotlight after their career-defining hit I'm In The Mood For Dancing in 1979 - meaning both their highs and lows were played out in public.",
      "The close-knit group, the original sisters - Linda, Anne, Denise, Maureen and Bernie (Coleen was initially too young) - had been on the music scene since 1974 and went on to become one of the biggest British groups of the late 70s and early 80s.",
      "The Nolans scored seven UK top 20 hits, including their most famous song, which reached number three in 1980.",
      "They also built up a big international following - particularly in Japan. And they went on tour with Frank Sinatra.",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "Singer Linda Nolan dies aged 65",
      "All this came with a sugary disco image and catchy bubblegum songs, also including Spirit, Body and Soul, Don't Make Waves and Don't Love Me Too Hard.",
      "\"For all its formulaic superficial corniness, I'm In The Mood For Dancing is a definite uplifting shiny-minded pop song,\" music journalist Paul Morley told BBC News.",
      "\"[It was] efficiently custom built for parties, Top of the Pops and weddings, and with a longevity you would not have seen coming at the time.\"",
      "'Importance of hard work'",
      "After some line-up changes, Linda left the group in 1983 to pursue a solo career, mainly in musical theatre - and with a good degree of success.",
      "Her most memorable role was in the West End production of Blood Brothers. Then there were regular TV appearances, including a notorious turn on 2014's Celebrity Big Brother, where she came face-to-face with her long-time adversary, comedian Jim Davidson.",
      "But, as the years went on, showbusiness seemed to be overshadowed for Linda and her siblings by a personal and family life marked by turmoil, tragedy and the breakdown of sisterly bonds.",
      "Linda was born in Ireland before her parents Tommy and Maureen Nolan, a husband-and-wife singing duo, moved the family to Blackpool in 1962 in search of work. There were eight Nolan offspring - six girls and two boys. All the girls sang and were performing from an early age.",
      "The Nolan girls found themselves on a treadmill of performances in nightclubs, on TV and on tours. Their fees paid the family bills.",
      "Their father doubled as their manager and would wait in the bar before taking them home in the early hours of a school day.",
      "\"The importance of hard work was drummed into us at an early age,\" Linda told The Telegraph in 2018. \"My attitude has always been that unless I'm on a stretcher, the show must go on.\"",
      "But, as it emerged much later, their father, an alcoholic and womaniser, was sexually abusing his eldest daughter, Anne. He was frequently violent, too. Tommy Nolan died aged 78 in 1998. Anne unloaded her secret in her 2008 autobiography.",
      "\"It must have been difficult for Anne all those years because everybody loved our father, absolutely loved him,\" Linda said in an interview with The Guardian.",
      "\"She must have been seething. People say it was probably cathartic for her to write the book, and I'm sure it was.\"",
      "The girls were \"spotted\" at a Blackpool gig in 1973 and signed a recording contract, but their big break came in 1978 when they got a deal with Epic Sony-CBS.",
      "So began the hits, world tours and regular appearances on TV shows from Top of the Pops to Morecambe and Wise.",
      "The Nolans sold 25 million albums globally but very little of the profits ended up in the girls' pockets, their father having failed to appreciate he could negotiate a bigger pay deal.",
      "In 1979, Linda met Brian Hudson, a former musician, and they married in 1981 despite the reservations of her parents over the 13-year age gap and Brian's history of two divorces. Brian also became The Nolans' tour manager.",
      "\"But when the other girls decided that my husband Brian wasn't right as their tour manager, I was devastated and opted to launch a solo career instead,\" Linda told The Telegraph later.",
      "She left with a cheque for \u00a313,000 - but then a tax bill came in for the same amount.",
      "Linda's solo career, managed by Brian, first saw her make guest appearances on TV and on the tours of such diverse names as Gene Pitney and Cannon and Ball.",
      "She also did her fair share of pantomimes before her musical theatre career kicked off with a part alongside Paul O'Grady in Prisoner Cell Block H: The Musical.",
      "The financial blows flared up again in 1995 when she and Brian were declared bankrupt. They were saved when a newspaper then paid Linda \u00a317,000 to tell her story.",
      "She put their money problems down to the \"feast or famine\" nature of showbiz.",
      "'Stabbed in the back'",
      "In 2000, Linda landed her most successful role, in Willy Russell's Blood Brothers, taking over as Mrs Johnstone from her younger sister Bernie.",
      "But it was also at the start of the 2000s that Linda's world, and that of her family, began to fall apart.",
      "First Anne was told she had breast cancer, then Brian was diagnosed with cancer of the skin. A year later, Linda was told she too had breast cancer.",
      "Anne recovered, and it was while Linda was undergoing treatment that she lost her husband of 26 years, a blow that left her contemplating suicide.",
      "\"He was the love of my life... I lost hope of ever being happy again and started thinking, as people do when they reach a certain point in depression, it would be better for everybody if I wasn't here and I would be doing them a favour,\" she revealed in early 2018.",
      "She was given the all-clear from cancer in 2006 but, too depressed to work, she started claiming benefits.",
      "Then in 2009 came a financial lifeline when Maureen, Linda, Bernie and Coleen were offered the chance of a reunion tour to celebrate the 30th anniversary of I'm In The Mood For Dancing.",
      "The tour went well but, on the family front, things turned decidedly sour. Anne declared she had been \"stabbed in the back\" by her siblings.",
      "\"No-one asked me. No-one involved me at all until it was too late. Now they've made it clear I am not wanted,\" she told The Daily Mail.",
      "The sisters claimed the decision had been the record company's and out of their hands. It caused a further rupture in the already fractured family relationship.",
      "Financial blows",
      "But the next year, the sisters attempted to come together to support Bernie, who was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and chemotherapy and was given the all-clear. But in 2012 the cancer returned, leading to her death aged 52.",
      "The sisters' truce came to an end soon afterwards.",
      "In 2014, Linda's financial problems returned when she was investigated by Blackpool council and the Department for Work and Pensions for claiming benefits to the tune of \u00a312,000 while working.",
      "\"I thought I'd stuck to the rules religiously, but some of the things they thought of as 'work' just hadn't occurred to me. I thought working meant doing a stage show, not quick television interviews,\" she told The Telegraph.",
      "She came up with a repayment plan and eventually was issued with a caution.",
      "That same year, Linda went into the Celebrity Big Brother house (reportedly because she needed the money), an experience that led to her telling torrid tales about her sex life and coming to verbal blows with Davidson.",
      "The two had been enemies since the 90s, when Brian had been caught stealing money from Davidson's friend and fellow comedian Frank Carson.",
      "As sister Coleen became a panellist on ITV's Loose Women, Linda also became a regular guest.",
      "And it was on that show in 2017 that a tearful Coleen told viewers her sister's cancer had returned, and this time was terminal.",
      "Linda had resumed her stage work but then, with the second diagnosis, she stopped. In March 2023, she confirmed that the cancer had spread to her brain.",
      "But as she made clear in her autobiography From My Heart - released in 2018 - she refused to spend the time she had left to live \"constantly stressing about cancer\".",
      "She added: \"I've chosen to enjoy the little things. I've chosen to laugh. And I've chosen to look back on my life and thank God for it.\""

    "story": [
      "For years people have tried - and failed - to uncover details about Bristol's most famous, yet anonymous, graffiti artist Banksy.",
      "Photos of him and stories of people who have met him are incredibly rare. But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous.",
      "Banksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "But behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about.",
      "On the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston.",
      "Here, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural.",
      "\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building.",
      "\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\"",
      "When Banksy came to Lawrence Weston youth centre",
      "Now all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous.",
      "The artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds \u2013 oblivious to who the artist would eventually become.",
      "It was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol.",
      "His friend had a suggestion \u2013 someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself. That person was Banksy.",
      "\"I got his phone number, so I used to call him up and ask if he'd come and do some art projects. He was really keen,\" Peter said.",
      "This was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.",

      "Banksy's Girl with Balloon print sells for \u00a380,000",
      "Each time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids.",
      "The purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub.",
      "\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society.",
      "\"It was always very vibrant.\"",
      "Peter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston.",
      "He was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said.",
      "\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said.",
      "\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas.",
      "\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented.",
      "\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\"",
      "And how much did it cost to bring in Banksy?",
      "\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him \u00a350. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\" Peter said.",
      "\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\"",
      "The murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour \u2013 but with meaning.",
      "Cows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots.",
      "'I painted over a Banksy'",
      "But what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again.",
      "\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\" Peter said.",
      "But he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art.",
      "\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people.",
      "\"And it was just another art project back then.\"",
      "For Peter, the value of Banky's time at the club is not monetary, but based on what these murals did for the community.",
      "He wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world.",
      "\"I'm very proud he came here,\" he said.",
      "\"There will be [those who were] young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy, and they may not know that.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:59:47 GMT",
    "summary": "As Love Island All Stars returns, we find out if reality stars can still have a lucrative social media career.",
    "story": [
      "The cast of this year's Love Island All Stars, a spin-off featuring former contestants, has been described as \"dating royalty\" by its makers.",
      "More than half of the 12 islanders heading to the South African villa were finalists on their respective series, while 2022 winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu is also rumoured to be entering later on.",
      "Appearing on Love Island was once seen as a route to independent fame and success.",
      "But could the return of names from some of the show\u2019s most popular series be a sign that the once-profitable pipeline from Islander to influencer or TV star is coming to an end?",
      "Becoming an influencer is a well-worn career path for those leaving Love Island, and past contestants have been paid by brands to sell everything from cosmetics to cars to social media users.",
      "Perhaps the highest achiever in this role has been 2019 series runner-up Molly-Mae Hague, who went on to work as a creative director for fast fashion brand Pretty Little Thing, and has recently launched her own fashion company.",
      "But Molly-Mae appeared on Love Island at the peak of its popularity. The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.",
      "Hitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.",
      "\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.",
      "Tanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.",
      "The hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".",
      "\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.",
      "'It's very saturated'",
      "A lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",
      "Figures from NHS England, for example, show the number of frontline healthcare workers getting their flu vaccine fell to 35% in November 2024 from 62% in the same month in 2019.",
      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers. At times the public were also told they needed Covid jabs (or a recent negative test) to travel abroad, to enter nightclubs and to visit cinemas in parts of the UK.",
      "Those kinds of strict health policies might force up vaccination rates in the short-term, argues Prof Larson at LSHTM, but there's a danger we are now starting to pay a \"long term price\".",
      "The worry is if people feel forced or coerced into taking a vaccine at certain times, wider vaccine confidence and uptake may experience a backlash.",
      "Personal liberty versus state control",
      "For 200 years vaccination has been entangled with personal liberty, state control and other political issues. That's increasingly playing out online where the wider debate also takes in global warming, gun control and immigration, for example.",
      "\"It's 'the people' versus the political and financial elites, with medical and scientific experts seen as among those deemed elitist, speaking a different language and entwined with big business and pharma,\" says Prof Larson.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump's controversial pick for US health secretary, Robert Kennedy Jr, has once again put vaccines firmly on the political agenda.",
      "In the past he has repeated the false claim that vaccines cause autism, urged parents not to jab their children, and had to apologise after claiming the number injured by vaccines was \"a holocaust\".",
      "He has denied on several occasions that he is anti-vaccination, instead saying he is \"pro-safety\".",
      "'We need to be more assertive'",
      "Dr Simon Williams at Swansea University now thinks health authorities have to be clearer about the dangers of some infectious diseases, in the face of online misinformation which often exaggerates the small risk of vaccines.",
      "\"Part of the reason tobacco control campaigns have been so effective since the 1980s was because they were so clear about how dangerous smoking is, and I think we can learn from that,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to be far more assertive about the potential risks of not getting vaccinated.\"",

      "Why wildfires are becoming faster and more furious",
      "How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate",
      "Another idea is \"pre-bunking\" - that is teaching people to expect and recognise misinformation online before they encounter it in real life, instead of relying on fact-checking and dull public health videos after the event.",
      "Prof Heidi Larson also thinks now is the time to target and better engage with those most at-risk of rejecting vaccines - in particular the younger groups that her data shows are most affected.",
      "\"I would start in schools, I would start in science classes, I think we are losing the plot if we only focus on disinformation, and don't start to build an appreciation of how vaccines work and their benefits,\" she says.",

      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",

    "story": [
      "There has been a rise in the proportion of women seeking abortions despite using \"natural\" methods to prevent pregnancy, like fertility tracking apps, a study in England and Wales suggests.",
      "The data, published in BMJ Sexual and Reproductive Health, shows a \"shift\" in contraception use in the last five years, from \"more reliable\" hormonal contraceptives such as the pill, to \"fertility awareness-based methods\", say researchers.",
      "Hormonal methods, including the mini pill, fell from 19% in 2018 to 11% in 2023 among tens of thousands of women.",
      "Use of natural methods, meanwhile, increased from 0.4% to 2.5% - still a minority but a significant rise that \"needs investigating\", say experts.",
      "What lies behind the rise of the contraception app?Period trackers 'coercing' women into sharing risky information",
      "What lies behind the rise of the contraception app?",
      "Period trackers 'coercing' women into sharing risky information",
      "Fertility apps help track fertile days so a woman can know when she would be most likely to get pregnant each month or menstrual cycle.",
      "They rely on measurements like body temperature to predict ovulation (when an egg is released from the ovary).",
      "Companies say they can be as much as 93% reliable when used correctly.",
      "However, they require people to take readings and control when they have sex, avoiding intercourse on days when the app tells them that they may be fertile.",
      "The NHS says if you do not follow the instructions exactly, the method is only 76% effective. This means 24 in 100 women will get pregnant when tracking their fertility for a year.",
      "In comparison, the pill and the mini pill are 91% effective with \"typical use\" and 99% effective with \"perfect\" use.",
      "Hormonal coils or implants, which do not rely on the user remembering to take them, are 99% effective.",
      "For the study, researchers from NHS Forth Valley and the University of Edinburgh compared data from the British Pregnancy Advisory Service for the periods January to June 2018 (33,495 women) and January to June 2023 (55,055 women) to see if contraceptive use changed.",
      "As well as the shift to natural methods, more women reported using no contraceptive at all in 2023 - 70% compared to 56% in 2018.",
      "It is impossible to say what is driving the trends, but difficulty accessing sexual health services during the Covid pandemic may be a factor, say the study authors.",
      "Lead researcher Dr Rosie McNee told the BBC: \"Something that really needs scrutiny is the surge in the use of ehealth, including fertility apps and period trackers.",
      "\"The market has exploded. There are hundreds of them and some are more reliable than others. Plus you don't need a prescription, and so you may not get all the information you need.\"",
      "She said some tracking apps are designed to track periods rather than fertility or family planning.",
      "Abortion provider MSI Reproductive Choices UK told the BBC it too has seen more women using fertility awareness methods.",
      "Tanya Lane, contraception lead, explained: \"This could be a result of the rise in popularity of social media platforms like TikTok, which has seen more people sharing their experiences...and content creators doing paid partnerships with brands of fertility awareness methods that might be influencing people to choose this option.",
      "Long waits for appointments at GP surgeries and sexual health clinics could also be a factor.",
      "\"People are waiting months for appointments in some areas of the UK, especially for long-acting methods like the coil and implant.\"",
      "She said that any woman thinking of switching to fertility tracking should speak to a medical professional.",
      "Dr Melanie Davis-Hall, Medical Director at women's health review platform The Lowdown, said: \"The key here is to reduce the spread of misinformation and the use of apps and methods that are not approved fertility awareness methods so people know they are equivalent to not using contraception. Then we need to address why people are ditching hormonal and non hormonal contraception and the role the spread of misinformation plays in this.\"",
      "Paula Baraitser, medical director of the NHS-partnered free sexual health service provider SH:24, said there could be many reasons why women are switching, including concerns about future fertility and possible side effects.",
      "The risks can range from mild side effects to rare but potentially serious complications.",
      "She told the BBC: \"Many people will use contraception for 30 years of their lives.",
      "\"People's experience of hormonal contraception is highly variable and ultimately we need a larger choice of methods to enable people to find one that suits them.",
      "\"There have been few new methods of contraception in the last 50 years, reflecting a lack of investment in research in this area.\"",
      "The sexual health charity Brook said many women use hormonal contraception not simply to prevent pregnancy, but to manage their menstrual health, to make periods lighter and more predictable.",
      "\"These benefits need to be part of the wider conversation about hormones,\" said spokeswoman Lisa Hallgarten."

    "story": [
      "The government will look at \"every conceivable way\" to prevent former Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams from receiving compensation, the prime minister has said.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer was speaking in the House of Commons after the Conservatives said it was \"shameful\" that repealing the Legacy Act could put Mr Adams in line for a \"cheque\".",
      "The Legacy Act presently blocks him - and many others interned without trial in the 1970s - from claiming compensation for unlawful detention.",
      "Mr Adams was detained in the early 1970s when the government in Northern Ireland introduced internment as violence spiralled in the early years of the Troubles.",
      "More than 1,900 people suspected of being members of paramilitary organisations were detained, but many were arrested based on flawed intelligence.",

      "If the Legacy Act was repealed, it is thought highly likely Mr Adams would pursue compensation.",
      "Several peers have backed a report by Policy Exchange, a London-based think tank, criticising moves to lift the ban.",
      "In a statement following the prime minister's comments, Mr Adams said people should remain cautious about what exactly was being proposed.",
      "He said a Supreme Court ruling in 2020 that his detention had been unlawful was \"explicit\".",

      "He referred to the Northern Ireland High Court ruling that part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.",
      "\"We will put in place a better framework, we're working on a draft remedial order and replacement legislation and we will look at every conceivable way to prevent these types of cases claiming damages and it's important I say that on the record,\" he said.",
      "If Mr Adams was successful with a compensation bid, it could result in a six-figure payout.",
      "This would cover both his unlawful detention and a prosecution for attempted escapes, for which he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years imprisonment.",
      "Speaking after Sir Keir's comments at PMQs, his official spokesman said he could not guarantee that compensation payments to Mr Adams or other former Troubles internees would be prevented.",

      "Victims' campaigner Kenny Donaldson said there had been cross-party opposition to compensation for Mr Adams and that the current government should uphold this position.",
      "He added that if there was a move to a position where \"Gerry Adams is compensated in this situation, then really we have debased society to an additional level and that would be a dagger to the heart of so many people\".",
      "Democratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson said it would be \"absurd if money from the public purse was to be handed to Gerry Adams\".",
      "\"The government needs to stop hiding behind court judgements,\" Robinson said.",

      "Meanwhile the attorney general for England and Wales was asked during an appearance at the Commons Justice Committee about previously acting as a legal representative for Mr Adams.",
      "Lord Hermer said he wasn't \"inclined\" to answer questions on how he was remunerated for his work for \"any given client\".",

      "It was first proposed by the then prime minister Boris Johnson in 2021 as a solution to ending what he called \"vexatious prosecutions\" of former soldiers.",
      "It was passed in 2023, but was opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland.",
      "The act created a new legacy body known as the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).",
      "It also shut down all historical inquests.",
      "The act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families.",
      "The court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.",
      "Labour pledged to repeal the Legacy Act if they won the general election in July and formally began that process in December.",
      "Why could Gerry Adams seek compensation?",
      "A Supreme Court judgement in 2020 paved the way for Mr Adams to receive damages after it quashed his convictions over two attempted prison break-outs.",
      "It ruled his detention was unlawful because the interim custody order (ICO) had not been \"considered personally\" by the then Northern Ireland Secretary Willie Whitelaw.",
      "At the time, the Conservative government argued the ICOs were lawful due to a convention known as the Carltona principle, where officials and junior ministers routinely act in the name of a secretary of state.",

    "summary": "Labour paused implementation of the act after taking power, due to concerns over student welfare.",
    "story": [
      "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.",
      "The Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.",
      "But its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.",
      "The act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.",
      "It included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.",
      "A new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.",
      "However, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.",
      "At the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".",
      "Phillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.",
      "Having spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.",
      "Issuing fines",
      "In a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".",
      "However, the government says it will seek to remove the part of the act that allows people to sue universities that fail to uphold their duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "It could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.",
      "There will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.",
      "The National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.",
      "The OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.",
      "Shadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.",
      "'Inciting violence'",
      "But the government said it would provide a workable version of the act that would protect minority groups while defending freedom of speech on campuses.",
      "The Union of Jewish Students (UJS) welcomed the revised act, saying it \"takes into account the concerns raised by UJS and other parties\".",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.",
      "But some of the original provisions in the act would \"gum up the works like you wouldn't believe\" for universities, she said.",
      "When the legislation was originally introduced, then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would allow speakers to \"articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence\".",
      "'Toothless tiger'",
      "Protests have taken place on university campuses in recent years, including before a talk by gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock at Oxford.",
      "There have also been cases of individuals being \"no-platformed\", where a controversial speaker is banned from an event.",
      "The education secretary said there had been too many such examples of freedom of speech not being upheld at universities and \"unacceptable\" cases like that of Prof Jo Phoenix, who was found by an employment tribunal to have been discriminated against and harassed at work because of her gender-critical beliefs.",
      "But Prof Phoenix told BBC News the revised version of the act was like a \"toothless tiger\" and the suppression of free speech still posed a \"real and visceral threat to the robustness of our universities\".",

    "story": [
      "MPs have voted for a new, one-month cap on advance rent payments in England as the Renters' Rights Bill edges closer to becoming law.",
      "Housing minister Matthew Pennycook confirmed the addition of a clause to stop landlords making upfront charges in the Commons on Tuesday.",
      "Landlord groups have warned the move could leave property owners open to risk if tenants have no other way of proving their ability to pay rent on an ongoing basis.",
      "And Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn warned some tenants were being evicted before the package of protections in the Bill, which includes a ban on \"no-fault\" evictions, can come into effect as expected this summer.",
      "Aim for no-fault eviction ban to be in place by summer",
      "Charities warn bill doesn't protect renters enough",
      "Bill banning no-fault evictions to return to Parliament",
      "Setting out the details of the cap in the Commons, Pennycook said the government wanted to stop demands for \"large rent-in-advance payments\", which he said could sometimes amount to 12 months of rent.",
      "Tenants who were \"perfectly able to afford the monthly rent\" were being asked to give landlords \"ever larger sums\" in advance, he said, or \"risk being locked out of renting altogether\".",
      "The latest move comes on top of existing measures intended to stop bidding wars for homes where \"often desperate tenants are pitted against each other so that landlords are able to extract the highest possible payment they can\"..",
      "Shadow housing minister David Simmonds said the bill had \"many shortcomings\" and would create \"concerns around the availability, and the affordability of accommodation in the private rented sector\".",
      "A coalition of groups representing landlords and letting agents claimed the cap on upfront payments could leave tenants unable to prove their ability to cover their rent.",
      "The groups, including the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA), said: \"Cutting off any assurance landlords might seek when renting to those who cannot easily prove their ability to afford a tenancy is neither practical nor responsible.\"",
      "But some MPs, including Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer, called for the government to go further and introduce rent controls.",
      "The Bristol Central MP said the high cost of renting was leaving people \"on the streets\" so \"rent controls are still needed - because having the right to something you cannot afford and cannot access is no help to anyone\".",
      "Labour's Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is a renter and the MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, said rent rises should be capped because \"I'm yet to hear a compelling reason why landlords should see their incomes grow faster than people who actually work for a living\".",
      "And former Labour leader Corbyn suggested evictions were happening before protections could be introduced, saying \"there seems to be quite a lot of landlords at the present time who are using unreasonable arguments in order to terminate tenancies or raise rents ahead of this legislation coming in\".",
      "Pennycook acknowledged there was \"a lot of bad practice in the sector\" that the government was keen to clamp down on, and acknowledged the potential for \"retaliatory economic no-fault evictions\" in the interim period.",
      "However, he drew the line at rent controls, saying there was evidence the measure could harm tenants.",
      "\"Once Section 21 [\"no-fault\"] evictions are done away with, unscrupulous landlords will no doubt attempt to evict tenants who assert their rights by means of extortionate rent rises,\" he said.",
      "However, he added, \"the government sincerely believe that the introduction of rent controls in the private rented sector could harm tenants as well as landlords as a result of reduced supply, and discourage investment\".",
      "Polly Neate, the chief executive of housing charity Shelter, welcomed the new cap on advance payments - but urged the government to go further on controlling rent rises.",
      "She said: \"For years, renters have been forced to magic up eye-watering sums up-front or see their hopes for a home vanish.",
      "\"With benefit recipients nearly twice as likely to be blocked from renting by demands for rent up-front, the government is absolutely right to use the Renters' Rights Bill to rein this discriminatory practice in.",
      "\"To truly make renting more secure and affordable, the Bill must limit in-tenancy rent increases in line with either inflation or wage growth.\"",
      "The bill was supported by a majority of MPs at third reading and will now pass to the Lords."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 11:24:22 GMT",
    "summary": "The Tory leader has been calling for a fresh inquiry into grooming gangs.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has met survivors of grooming gangs in Oldham and Rotherham, describing the meeting as \"quite shocking\".",
      "Speaking to GB News, she said it was \"extraordinary\" hearing victims describe going \"to the authorities multiple times... and in one particular case the police actually handed her, a 12-year-old, into the hands of her abusers\".",
      "Badenoch has been demanding a national inquiry into grooming gangs, but has faced criticism after reports she had so far failed to meet any victims.",
      "On Monday, the Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, joined calls for a public inquiry, saying it was required to \"restore faith in our safeguarding systems\".",
      "What is Starmer's record on prosecuting grooming gangs?",
      "Rotherham MP Champion backs national grooming inquiry",
      "MPs vote against Tory call for new grooming gangs inquiry",
      "Speaking to GB News on Monday evening, Badenoch said she was \"going to do everything, and the Conservative Party is going to do everything, to make sure that you [survivors] get justice\".",
      "Pressed on why the previous Conservative government had not commissioned an inquiry into grooming gangs, she said: \"I think we thought that the inquiries that we'd started would be enough.\"",
      "\"I thought 'oh, there's an inquiry taking place, let's see what it comes out with,' and what we've seen is that we've had multiple non-national inquiries. They are not enough. Let's do more,\" she said.",
      "Badenoch said she believed a new national inquiry should look at a \"systematic pattern of behaviour\" among certain communities in the country.",
      "It is \"people very, very poor, sort of peasant background \u2013 very, very rural, almost cut off from even the home origin countries that they might have been in,\" she said. \"They're not necessarily first generation,\" she added.",
      "She said a \"culture of silence\" in the state needed to be addressed.",
      "Between 1997 and 2013, several areas of the country - including Oldham and Rotherham - were blighted by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, who raped and trafficked children as young as 11.",
      "An independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham.",
      "She would later go on to lead a national review into child sexual abuse, which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations when it was published in 2022.",
      "Prof Jay has previously said victims want to see action on her recommendations, rejecting the calls for a fresh probe.",
      "There have also been a series of local reviews into child sex abuse in Manchester, Rochdale and Oldham, which were published between 2020 and 2024 and found authorities had failed to protect children from sexual exploitation by gangs of predominantly Asian men.",
      "In recent weeks, the Conservatives and Reform UK have been calling for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs.",
      "Earlier this month, the Tories failed in a bid to force a fresh national investigation by amending a government education bill.",
      "When asked whether the reason that a national inquiry had not been called was because politicians could be implicated in a cover-up, and whether the Labour Party was resisting an investigation, Badenoch said that it was \"certainly something that we have to look at\".",
      "\"I am not afraid, the Conservative Party is under new leadership. What we did before to tackle it is clearly not enough, we need to do a lot more, and Labour needs to get on board with that.\"",
      "Champion has called for a national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, with councils leading the investigations.",
      "Under the model suggested by Champion, the Home Office would act as a central \"hub,\" setting terms and empowering councils to compel testimony, while local \"spokes\" would lead inquiries and send findings for a national report.",
      "Champion, who has been campaigning on child protection for over a decade, said: \"I have long believed that we need to fully understand the nature of this crime and the failures in the response of public bodies if we are to truly protect children.\"",
      "Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she argued locally-run investigations had uncovered child sexual abuse, but have \"been missing\" the power to compel witnesses to testify and hold offenders accountable.",
      "'Range of views'",
      "Two other Labour figures from places affected - Rochdale MP Paul Waugh and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - have also called for limited new inquiries.",
      "But Downing Street has said its priority is to implement the recommendations of Prof Jay's national review in 2022.",
      "Last week, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said one of the key proposals from the report - for workers in certain roles to face mandatory requirements to report abuse - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.",
      "Number 10 said on Monday that there would be a \"range of views\" on the issue of a new inquiry, and the government would be \"guided and led by the victims and survivors\".",
      "Security Minister Dan Jarvis said he understood why colleagues were calling for a new national inquiry, but argued the government's priority was \"delivering the justice that these victims deserve\".",
      "He told BBC Breakfast: \"We think the best and most timely way to do that is to do the work that the previous government were not able to do of implementing the findings of Prof Alexis Jay's report.\""

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves will remain in her role \"for the whole of this Parliament\", Downing Street has said, as she faces criticism over the falling pound and rising government borrowing costs.",
      "The pound fell to $1.21 on Monday, its lowest level since November 2023, while one measure of the rate at which the government can borrow money hit its highest level since 2008.",
      "Borrowing costs are rising for many countries across the world, but some have argued that decisions made in the Budget appear to have made the UK more vulnerable.",
      "The Conservatives said the chancellor was \"hanging on by her fingernails\".",
      "When asked at a press conference earlier whether Reeves would remain chancellor for the whole of the Parliament, the prime minister declined to answer, but did then say she had his \"full confidence\" and was doing a \"fantastic job\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"The prime minister just refused to back his chancellor staying in her job.",
      "\"The markets are in turmoil and business confidence has crashed, yet the chancellor is nowhere to be seen.\"",
      "However, the prime minister's official spokesman later said: \"You heard from the prime minister this morning.",
      "\"He was very explicit (that) he has full confidence in the chancellor and he'll be working with her in the role of chancellor for the whole of this Parliament.\"",
      "The row comes after the chancellor defended her decision to travel to China to improve economic ties with the country, despite the uncertainty in the financial markets.",
      "The Conservatives said she had \"fled to China\", but Reeves said agreements reached in Beijing would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.",
      "Reeves is a central figure in the Labour government, presented to the voters as a safe pair of hands in the run-up to the election. She also led the work to build bridges with business.",
      "But business and some other observers were shaken by her first Budget in October, which they fear could knock the wind from the economy further, rather than spur the growth Labour has promised.",
      "Market jitters over the past week have increased concerns over the government's economic strategy.",
      "Rising borrowing costs will have a knock-on effect on the government's tax and spending plans, because it will have to pay more interest to finance its existing debt. That leaves less to spend on public services and investment.",
      "Trump factor",
      "Governments generally borrow money by selling bonds to big investors, such as pension funds. UK government bonds are known as gilts.",
      "The yield on the 10-year gilt - the interest rate at which the government pays back a decade-long loan to investors - rose to 4.88% on Monday, its highest level for 17 years.",
      "The 30-year gilt yield climbed to 5.44%, its highest in 27 years.",
      "Government debt costs in Germany, France, Spain and Italy also rose on Monday.",
      "Some experts say investors are reacting to the re-election of former US President Donald Trump and his talk of tariffs.",
      "There is concern this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought, and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as expected, both in the US and elsewhere.",
      "Strong US jobs data released on Friday added to expectations that US rates will stay higher for longer, and this has helped to strengthen the value of the dollar against other currencies.",
      "However, Emma Wall, head of platform investors at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the UK's problems were not purely caused by global issues, arguing that measures announced in the Budget have stoked inflation.",
      "\"If you can get inflation under control, you will see interest rates come down in the UK,\" she added.",
      "Reeves also faced questions over her self-imposed rules on government debt and spending, which she said on Saturday were \"non-negotiable\".",
      "Despite her commitment, some have questioned whether she will be able to achieve the targets without making further spending cuts or tax rises because of how government debt costs have risen.",
      "On Monday, Sir Keir said the government was going to keep to its fiscal rules.",
      "However, he added that the government would be \"ruthless\" in its decisions for the upcoming spending review.",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Reeves faces 'difficult decisions' on tax and spending",
      "Confidence 'bruised'",
      "The government has made growing the UK's economy a key objective, but recent figures indicate the economy saw zero growth between July and September, while it contracted during October.",
      "Businesses have warned that Budget measures, such as the rise in employer National Insurance contributions, together with the higher National Living Wage could lead to job cuts and price rises.",
      "Rupert Soames, chair of the Confederation of British Business (CBI), said the picture was \"not good\" but insisted that firms were still somewhat upbeat.",
      "\"I wouldn't say confidence is gone,\" he told the BBC's Today programme. \"I'd say it's bruised.\"",
      "However, he said the government was making the situation worse by introducing the Employment Rights Bill, which he said contained \"powerful dissuaders to employment\".",
      "Unions argue the protections introduced in the bill, such as banning fire-and-rehire, make employees safer, while the government has said it \"represents the biggest upgrade in employment rights for a generation\".",
      "However, Mr Soames said the bill would lead to job losses.",
      "\"Businesses will not only not employ, they will let people go,\" he said.",
      "As part of its push for growth, the government revealed plans on Monday to make the UK the global capital of artificial intelligence through measures such as building a new supercomputer.",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence presents a \"vast potential\" for rejuvenating UK public services, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said on Monday.",
      "In a speech setting out the government's plans to use AI across the UK to boost growth and deliver services more efficiently, Sir Keir said the government had a responsibility to make AI \"work for working people\".",
      "The AI Opportunities Action Plan is backed by leading tech firms, some of which have committed \u00a314bn towards various projects, creating 13,250 jobs, the government said.",
      "But the government faces questions over how much time and money will be needed to make its vision a reality, amid concerns over borrowing costs and the falling value of the pound.",
      "The plan includes proposals for growth zones where development will be focused, and suggests the technology will be used to help tackle issues such as potholes.",
      "While estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support the claim that AI could increase productivity, it also says the changes may come gradually.",
      "The government tasked AI adviser Matt Clifford with creating a UK action plan for supporting the growth of artificial intelligence and its use in public services.",
      "He came back with 50 recommendations which are now being implemented.",
      "Among these is for the UK to invest in a new supercomputer to boost computing power - marking a change in strategy after the Labour government ditched the previous government's plans for a supercomputer at Edinburgh University.",
      "Sir Keir said AI \"will drive incredible change\" in the country and \"has the potential to transform the lives of working people\".",
      "\"We're going to make AI work for everyone in our country,\" he added, saying the \"battle for the jobs of tomorrow is happening today\".",
      "Sir Keir said the UK would become one of the AI \"superpowers\" - mirroring former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's drive to boost the UK sector so it could rival that of the US and China.",
      "At the time, many of Sunak's proposals were geared towards mitigating future risks of highly powerful AI systems.",
      "In October 2023, he said AI could enable faster, easier production of chemical and biological weapons, or be used by terrorist groups to spread disinformation.",
      "He added that in a worst-case scenario, society could lose control over AI.",
      "His government's emphasis on \"safety\" seems largely absent in this new plan  - instead focusing on maximising opportunities, growth and innovation.",
      "The pivot away from the previous narrative of caution and safety suggests the government has decided the UK should attempt to compete in the AI arms race, currently lead by major global players including the US and China.",
      "However, building data centres and boosting the nation's computing power will not happen overnight.",
      "This means the government is unlikely to see the end results of this major project ahead of the next general election - when Labour will have to convince voters that it was still the right decision, at a time when public finances remain stretched.",
      "Professor Dame Wendy Hall said the proposals were \"ambitious\", but necessary to help the UK keep up with the pace of development.",
      "\"It's an ambitious plan but there's a lot of upfront investment,\" she told BBC Radio Four's Today programme.",
      "\"It will take some time to see a return on that investment and they've got to be in it for the long-term.\"",
      "How the AI plan could affect you",
      "Among the government's proposals are:",
      "AI will be used by the public sector to enable its workers to spend less time doing admin and more time delivering services.Several \"AI Growth Zones\" around the UK will be created, involving big building projects and new jobs.AI will be fed through cameras around the country to inspect roads and spot potholes that need fixing Teachers and small business owners were highlighted as two groups that could start using AI for things like faster planning and record-keeping.AI is already being used in UK hospitals for important tasks such as diagnosing cancer more quickly and it will continue to be used to support the NHS.",

      "\"It's time the government recognised this broader definition and tapped into the full potential of AI across the UK.\"",

      "Is AI the answer for better government services?",
      "AI 'not perfect'",

      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",
      "In July 2022, Badenoch, who was not then a minister, said the bill was in \"no fit state to become law\" adding: \"We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.\"",
      "Another Conservative MP, David Davis, said it risked \"the biggest accidental curtailment of free speech in modern history\".",
      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",
      "He also said the act contained some \"very good powers\" he was using to \"assertively\" tackle new safety concerns and that in the coming months ministers would get the powers to make sure online platforms were providing age-appropriate content.",
      "Companies that did not comply with the law would face \"very strident\" sanctions, he said.",
      "Following the interview, a Whitehall source told the BBC the government was not planning to repeal the Online Safety Act, or pass a second act, but to work within what ministers believe are its limitations.",
      "Ministers are not ruling out further legislation but wanted \"to be agile and quick\" to keep up with fast-moving trends, a source said.",
      "How can you keep children safe online?",
      "Molly Russell's dad warns UK 'going backwards' on online safety and urges PM to act",
      "Facebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkers",
      "In his letter, Ian Russell argued that \"ominous\" changes in the tech industry put greater pressure on the government to act.",
      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

    "story": [
      "The father of Molly Russell, the teenager who took her own life after seeing harmful content online, has personally appealed to the prime minister to tighten rules that protect children and has warned the UK is \"going backwards\" on internet safety.",
      "Ian Russell, who backed the previous government bringing in new requirements for tech firms in the Online Safety Act, calls the way the regulator Ofcom is implementing the rules a \"disaster\".",
      "In a letter to Sir Keir Starmer on Saturday, seen by the BBC, Mr Russell says there is \"widespread dismay\" among bereaved families who have fought for tougher protections, and that more young people have lost their lives because of \"dither and delay\".",
      "And he warns that without tougher actions, \"the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model\".",
      "\"This preventable harm would be happening on your watch,\" he writes to Sir Keir.",
      "The Online Safety Act, introduced last year, is designed to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and protect children from some legal-but-harmful material. Ofcom decides the specific guidelines that companies must follow.",
      "Safety campaigners believe there are significant loopholes in Ofcom's code on illegal content, including a lack of specific rules on live streaming or content that promotes suicide and self-harm. And the new codes of practice, which are still being worked on, won't apply to private messaging.",
      "An Ofcom spokesperson said: \"We recognise the profound pain caused by harmful content online, and our deepest sympathies remain with Ian Russell and all those who have suffered unimaginable loss.\" They said the voices of victims \"will continue to be at the heart of our work\".",
      "The spokesperson added that tech firms are required to assess the risks of illegal harms on their platforms by 16 March, and after that companies would need measures to reduce the risk of illegal content appearing and to remove it quickly when it appears.",

      "And in an exclusive interview, Mr Russell told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that Meta's platforms, Facebook and Instagram, were turning \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to and therefore more children will be exposed to in the future\".",
      "\"And by turning the platforms backwards away from safety, Mark Zuckerberg has changed the game fundamentally and shown that the platforms aren't really here to play safe, they're here to make money,\" he said. Zuckerberg announced this week that Meta was abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told the BBC that there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and that the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",

      "He also said that he thought there was \"no real movement\" within government. \"The online safety push has stagnated,\" he said. \"In fact, we're probably heading backwards because the tech platforms have changed the way they're playing the game.\"",
      "He said he was sure Sir Keir \"is a father who protects his children from online dangers as much as any individual can\".",
      "\"But as a prime minister, he needs to really back online safety and move forward so that the UK is the safest place in the world to be online,\" he added.",

We are grateful for all their contributions and will continue to work with them to get this right.",
      "\"This government is committed to ensuring online safety for children. Social media platforms must step up to their responsibilities and take robust action to protect children from seeing harmful content on their sites.\"",
      "Mr Russell's daughter Molly took her own life in November 2017 after being exposed to a stream of dark, depressing content on Pinterest and Instagram. He has been campaigning for online safety measures since his daughter's death.",
      "You can read his letter in full at the bottom of this story.",
      "Ian Russell's voice hard for Starmer to ignore",
      "No one watching or listening to Mr Russell over the years could deny his passion for change or his deep knowledge of the dark world that Molly was caught up in. Along with other bereaved parents we have met in the past couple of years - including Esther Ghey, Judy Thomas, and Mariano Janin - he has told his family's story with huge dignity, and for a simple reason: he doesn't want anyone else to go through the pain.",
      "He's become a prominent campaigner on an issue that is important to millions of parents and young people around the country. His voice is hard for the government to ignore.",
      "But creating and then imposing rules on the online world is difficult for politicians for many reasons.",
      "The Online Safety Act weathered many controversies and took years to put together. On one side were campaigners concerned about providing protection, on the other, fierce lobbying from the tech companies against straying into censorship or invading people's privacy.",
      "Ofcom was picked to police the rules and could theoretically be incredibly tough, threatening fines of millions of pounds or even prison for those companies that break them. But the new codes of practice are not yet fully in force.",
      "But campaigners like Mr Russell believe it's already obvious the rules fall short. The Internet Watch Foundation boss, Derek Ray-Hill, also told us: \"Unless Ofcom is more ambitious in its interpretation of the Act, so many of the things the legislation makes possible will remain frustratingly out of reach.\"",
      "There is a sense in Whitehall of \"wait and see\". Ministers have acknowledged that as technology advances, extra laws might be required. The Home Office is expected in the next couple of weeks to outline new offences to tackle child abuse online. But the government is also nervous about making rules so tight that tech companies feel unwelcome.",
      "This weekend we'll be joined by the Technology Secretary Peter Kyle, who is determined to make the UK a good place for big tech companies to do business, to help the economy grow. From Sunday onwards he will spell out how artificial intelligence can speed up government business and improve our public services \u2013 this government, like Rishi Sunak's, believes AI can boost the UK's sagging productivity.",
      "But the advance of those technologies bring risks, and tricky decisions for ministers.",
      "Warnings that advanced AI could wipe out thousands of jobs; concerns over deepfake video in pornography, child abuse, or misinformation. Even Paul McCartney and Kate Bush have got the government in their sights as they campaign to try to protect artists' work being used without payment by giant AI platforms, upending decades of copyright law.",
      "Multiple sources familiar with government discussions on child safety and other aspects of this massive quandary say they are concerned the Department of Science and Technology (DSIT) is not paying enough attention to the possible downsides.",
      "A government source said some discussions about protecting people online had been \"spicy\". \"This is a form of harm. It's normal for departments like Home Office and Department of Health to be constantly reviewing what's going on to keep up with safety \u2013 [DSIT] is not yet used to having to doing the same.\"",
      "A source at DSIT said the department had already acknowledged there might have to be more legislation in future but highlighted the fact that the Ofcom codes aren't yet completed or in force.",
      "And a spokesperson said: \"Bereaved parents have suffered the most unimaginable loss, and we are prepared to use every lever at our disposal to improve online safety for children.",
      "\"Changes coming into force through the Online Safety Act will ensure platforms have to act to protect children from harmful online content, with Ofcom ready to enforce these new laws from March. They have our complete backing to use the full range of their powers to root harmful material from the internet, and we expect platforms to be acting now to prepare for these changes.\"",
      "These aren't new arguments. But Musk's trolling of the UK government and Zuckerberg's flex away from fact checking have shifted the ground on which the conversations are taking place.",
      "Ministers have to consider what's right for the economy as well as protecting the public. And they might not want to admit it, but no politician wants to pick a fight with billionaires with massive social media megaphones - or indeed be seen to curtail our liberties or privacy without good reason. Arguably that is why measures like the Online Safety Act took so long to introduce in the first place.",

      "Dear Prime Minister,",
      "Six months ago, you were elected on a platform that promised an end to short-term sticking plaster solutions. I am writing to you as a bereaved father and online safety campaigner because it is evident that urgent action is required to protect young people from the horrors they are routinely exposed to online.",
      "It's now over seven years since the death of my youngest daughter Molly. More than ever before, I am convinced that strong and effective online safety regulation is the most powerful tool available to prevent the loss of ever more young lives at the hands of social media platforms whose indifference to children's safety is fundamentally baked into their commercial strategies, business models and products.",
      "However, in recent months it has become clear that progress towards online safety has stalled \u2013 and we are now going backwards. Regulation as it is currently designed is failing to deliver the protection that children and parents need, want and deserve. No one can credibly claim that Ofcom's implementation of the Online Safety Act is anything other than a disaster \u2013 a view not only shared widely by civil society but also increasingly privately shared across many parts of your Government.",
      "Ofcom's choices when implementing the Act have starkly highlighted intrinsic structural weaknesses with the legislative framework. We not only have a regulator which has fundamentally failed to grasp the urgency and scale of its mission, but a regulatory model that inherently and significantly constrains its ability to reduce preventable harms.",
      "While I understand that this is legislation you inherited and did not design, the reality is that unless you now commit to act decisively to fix the Online Safety Act, the streams of life-sucking content seen by children will soon become torrents: a digital disaster driven by the actions of tech firms, and being left unchallenged by a failing regulatory model. This preventable harm would be happening on your watch.",
      "At the same time as the UK's overdue regulation is falling badly short, the very industry being regulated is ominously changing. The Online Safety Act was developed around a premise that large tech firms would increasingly accept their responsibilities, and we would see safer social networks develop over time.",
      "However, this is a time when platforms readily say they will now 'catch less of the bad stuff'; allow underdeveloped AI to generate and spread disinformation; and promote targeted and polarising content leading to isolation and despair. We have now entered a different era, and we will need a different regulatory approach that can address it.",
      "Put simply, people like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk are at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry. We should be in absolutely no doubt that when Zuckerberg speaks about a 'cultural tipping point towards prioritizing speech', he is signalling a profound strategic shift away from fundamental safety measures towards a laissez-faire, anything goes model. In this bonfire of digital ethics and online safety features, all of us will lose, but our children lose the most.",
      "It's on that basis that I now encourage you to act swiftly and decisively to address this coming flood of preventable harm. In the immediate term, that means strengthening the existing framework. Beyond that, it means committing to substantially strengthened regulatory model \u2013 with primary legislation being introduced as soon as possible to enact its provisions.",
      "It is not just a new Online Safety Act that is required, but a wholesale re-imagining of the framework to ensure it is capable of responding to the threats of today and beyond. A new framework must be fundamentally oriented towards tackling the reckless behaviours of social media leadership \u2013 a goal which can best be achieved through establishing an overarching Duty of Care supported by a robust set of conduct-based rules to enforce it.",
      "A bolstered OSA must have harm reduction at its core. That means having a clear harm reduction duty on Ofcom, transparency and safety-by-design as integral components of the regulatory regime, and a regulatory design that puts victims at its core \u2013 a major failure of the current regime, where the asymmetry between the interests of victims and industry has if anything been substantially reinforced. The voices of those with lived experience must be heard clearly if big tech's powerful players are not to shout them down in this debate.",
      "Crucially, this must also mean an extension of the Duty of Candour to extend to tech firms. This vital measure stands to correct the historic injustices faced by so many victims, and the power of this measure to address the cultural issues driving harms in the tech sector \u2013 and the asymmetry between industry and victims which perpetuates further harm \u2013 would be considerable.",
      "Too many parents have lost hope that governments will deliver the online safety reform they urgently need. Among bereaved families, there is widespread dismay that successive governments have chosen to dither and delay when the consequences of inaction has been further lost lives.",
      "As Prime Minister and as a father, I implore you to act. You now have a profound opportunity, but also a great responsibility, to act clearly and decisively and to show to millions of parents across this country that meaningful change is on the way. It is time to decisively protect children and young adults from the perils of our online world.",

      "Well, tackling economic crime, money laundering and illicit finance among other things.",

      "When Labour won power in July, she was appointed economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister, responsible for the UK's financial services sector.",
      "But she resigned on 14 January after growing pressure over an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh.",
      "It centred around claims her family embezzled nearly \u00a34bn from the country's infrastructure projects.",
      "Siddiq is a niece of Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, who was overthrown by a pro-democracy uprising earlier this year.",
      "Siddiq also came under scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "Siddiq says that she acted openly and with the advice of officials, but left government because she risked becoming a distraction.",
      "The PM's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, found Siddiq had not breached the Ministerial Code and had found no evidence of financial impropriety, but he said it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq \"was not more alert to the potential reputational risks\" of her close family's association with Bangladesh.",

      "They met and married in London, and later moved their family - Siddiq has an elder brother and a younger sister - to Hampstead.",
      "Raised as a Muslim, Siddiq said the family \"embraced multicultural Britain... in the heart of the [local] Jewish community\".",
      "As a child, she met Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Mother Teresa, and her family were invited to the White House.",
      "Her maternal grandfather was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president. He and most of his family were assassinated when soldiers stormed their home in Dhaka in a military coup in 1975.",

      "Siddiq joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, later giving the NHS and the care her disabled father as the main reason.",
      "She named former cabinet minister Barbara Castle as her political heroine, and has described her mother and maternal aunt as \"two very strong feminists\".",
      "Pre-politics, she worked for Amnesty International, Save The Children and the Greater London Authority, among others.",

      "In 2017, while campaigning for Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Siddiq was asked in a Channel 4 News interview why she had not challenged her aunt, who had been accused of leading an authoritarian government in Bangladesh guilty of human rights abuses.",

    "summary": "Activists gathering at a regional conference assess whether the US billionaire could help or hinder the party.",
    "story": [
      "Even by the standards of the Reform UK party, it has been an interesting few weeks.",
      "In December, its leader Nigel Farage flew to Florida to meet Elon Musk, the multi-billionaire, where they discussed a possible donation.",
      "On Boxing Day, it announced its membership figures had surpassed those of the Conservatives. There was then a spat with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch over whether those numbers were correct.",

      "Reform UK members gathering on an icily cold Friday evening at Sandown Racecourse for the party's South East conference weren't disheartened by the possible loss of a rich and influential backer.",

      "\"He is destructive, he could destroy Reform.\"",
      "There are about 850 attendees at Sandown, according to the organisers, who say it was a sold out event.",
      "Among them is Howard Ward from Winchester, who has switched to Reform from the Conservatives.",
      "Like many here he is not bothered about Musk. \"Let him talk away,\" he says.",

      "Musk hasn't explained his reasoning, but Farage said the pair had a disagreement because Musk wanted Reform to \"come out strongly in support\" of Tommy Robinson.",
      "Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court.",
      "The former head of the far-right English Defence League admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.",
      "Farage left his former party UKIP in 2018 saying its association with Robinson had brought \"scuffles\" and \"violence\" to the party.",
      "He has ruled out Robinson being allowed to join Reform UK.",
      "Party members at the event at Sandown talk seriously about electoral success, and while many express sympathy for Robinson, they understand why he might be politically unpalatable.",
      "\"Whatever happens with Tommy, his heart is in the right place but he will never be forgiven by the mainstream media,\" says Kevin Burrell.",
      "\"Much as I admire what he's doing I can understand why Reform don't support him.",
      "\"If you end up in a slanging match over that, you will end up with the Tories or Labour.\"",
      "Jackie Collett says she doesn't know \"what is making Nigel dig is heels in\" but adds that Robinson is a \"loose cannon\".",
      "She says she is a realist and acknowledges that Reform might \"disappear into the wilderness\" but for now she says it is \"the only party that gives me hope to go out in the morning\".",
      "As the evening progresses, news emerges about the 10 Reform UK councillors in Derbyshire who resigned, arguing the party was being run in an \"increasingly autocratic manner\" and had \"lost its sense of direction\" since Farage took over.",
      "Farage later told BBC Newsnight the group were a \"rogue branch\" of the party who had not \"passed vetting\".",
      "The group's leader, Councillor Alex Stevenson, who was suspended as a member in December, and who stood for Reform UK in Amber Valley in the general election, did not deny that some of the candidates he put forward for local elections had not passed the party's vetting process.",
      "There is no mention of the resignations at the conference, instead members are invited to cheer two councillor defections from the Conservatives to Reform.",
      "And there is little public sign of discontent with Farage, although one member whispers his unease.",

      "Reform UK was originally called the Brexit Party but these days Brexit only gets a few mentions.",
      "The big themes include opposition to net-zero policies, support for a national inquiry into grooming gangs, the economy and the possible postponement of local elections in May.",
      "More than half of the county councils due to have elections could ask ministers to delay the ballots, following a major shake-up of local government.",
      "Earlier this week, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said it would be \"ludicrous\" to hold elections for councils that were due to be reorganised.",
      "However, the subject has infuriated Reform UK members, many of whom hope the May elections could see the party make electoral gains.",
      "Blogger Liza Martin-Pope says it is why she decided to attend the conference this evening adding: \"I'm missing my dancing for this.\"",
      "She argues that the potential delays amount to \"removing access to local democracy for local people.\"",
      "\"These authorities are running scared.\"",

      "They are new members, new to politics and Caroline says she puts the chances of Farage being prime minister after the next election at 10 out of 10.",
      "The party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour, says Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common, with ratings up from around 15 to 20%. But a general election is years away.",
      "Whether the party can go from five MPs in 2024 to government remains to be seen, but whatever happens, it's clear there are party members still enthused by Reform's offer."

      "Government borrowing costs have been steadily rising in recent months, and have now hit their highest levels for several years.",
      "Why is this happening and how does it affect you?",
      "What's happening in the bond markets?",
      "A bond is a bit like an IOU that can be traded in the financial markets.",
      "Governments generally spend more than they raise in tax so they borrow money to fill the gap, usually by selling bonds to investors.",
      "As well as eventually paying back the value of the bond, governments pay interest at regular intervals so investors receive a stream of future payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid. They are mainly bought by financial institutions, such as pension funds.",
      "Interest rates - known as the yield -  on government bonds have been going up since around August.",
      "The yield on a 10-year bond has surged to its highest level since 2008, while the yield on a 30-year bond is at its highest since 1998, meaning it costs the government more to borrow over the long term.",
      "The pound has also fallen in value against the dollar over the past few days. On 7 January it was worth $1.25 but it has now fallen to just above $1.21.",
      "Why are bond yields rising?",
      "Yields are rising not just in the UK. Borrowing costs have also been going up in the US, Japan, Germany and France, for instance.",
      "There is a great deal of uncertainty around what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House later this month. He has pledged to bring in tariffs on goods entering the US and to cut taxes.",
      "Investors worry that this will lead to inflation being more persistent than previously thought and therefore interest rates will not come down as quickly as they had expected.",
      "But in the UK there are also concerns about the economy underperforming.",
      "Inflation is at its highest for eight months - hitting 2.6% in November - above the Bank of England's 2% target - while the economy has shrunk for two months in a row.",
      "Analysts say it is these wider concerns about the strength of the economy that is driving down the pound, which typically rises when borrowing costs increase.",
      "However, the dollar is also rising against all currencies - not just the pound.",
      "The US economy created more jobs than forecast last month which has added to expectations that US rates will remain higher than previously forecast, and this has helped to push up the value of the dollar.",
      "How does it affect me?",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged that all day-to-day spending should be  funded from taxes, not from borrowing.",
      "But if she needs more money to pay back higher borrowing costs, that uses up more tax revenue, leaving less money to spend on other things.",
      "Economists have warned that this could mean spending cuts which would affect public services, and tax rises that could hit people's pay or businesses' ability to grow and hire more people.",
      "The government has committed to having only one fiscal event a year, where it can raise taxes, and this is not expected until the autumn.",
      "So if higher borrowing costs persist, we may be more likely to see cuts to spending before that or at least lower spending increases than would otherwise happen.",
      "Some people may be wondering about the impact of higher gilt yields on the mortgage market, particularly after what happened after Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022.",
      "Although yields are higher now than they were then, they have been creeping up slowly over a period of months, whereas in 2022 they shot up over a couple of days.",
      "That speedy rise led to lenders quickly pulling deals while they tried to work out what interest rate to charge.",
      "Analysts and brokers say the current unease in the markets is having some effect on the pricing of mortgages. Many were expecting to see some falls in rates at the start of the year but instead lenders are holding off from cuts to see what happens.",
      "However, the market is favourable to anyone currently buying an annuity - a product from an insurance company that gives a retirement income for the rest of their life, bought only once.",
      "One annuity expert told the BBC many people would get a better deal now than at any time since 2008, because annuity rates usually move in line with gilt yields.",
      "When will interest rates fall?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "What happens next?",
      "The Treasury has said there is no need for an emergency intervention in the financial markets.",
      "It has said it will not make any spending or tax announcements ahead of the official borrowing forecast from its independent watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), due on 26 March.",
      "If the OBR says the chancellor is still on track to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules then that might settle the markets.",
      "However, if the OBR were to say because of slower growth and higher-than-expected interest rates, the chancellor were likely to break her fiscal rules then that would potentially be a problem for Reeves.",

      "A stuttering economy, spiralling government borrowing costs, plummeting approval ratings: little wonder perhaps senior ministers, not least the chancellor, aren't wasting many smiles these days.",
      "Remember too Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are the duo that best personify the Labour project of the 2020s; the party's revival and return, grounded in being trusted on the economy.",
      "And yet the markets are collectively passing a verdict on Starmer and Reeves's economic plan right now and it isn't exactly a ringing endorsement \u2013 and wobbly markets can prompt political wobbles.",
      "These shouldn't be overstated, but neither should they be ignored.",
      "What we're witnessing is the brutal slog of government playing out; an unforgiving backdrop of economic flatlining, which critics say ministers have made worse.",
      "Some Labour MPs fret about how tricky governing is proving to be, about the grumbles in their inboxes and about the prospect of the government having less money to spend on their priorities than they had hoped for.",
      "Against that backdrop it shouldn't be that surprising that reporters would double check the prime minister has a confidence in his chancellor that the markets don't appear to \u2013 yes he did, he told us, albeit without committing explicitly to keeping her in post until the next election as the questioners had asked.",
      "Cue a number of excitable headlines before Downing Street said it did indeed intend to keep Reeves in post as chancellor for the rest of this parliament.",
      "Folk in No 10 regarded the exchanges as absurd, given how close Starmer and Reeves have been for years and how intertwined their political fates are.",
      "They each have to hope that the markets settle down, that the cost of government borrowing falls and so the prospect of very difficult decisions recede.",
      "Once again the prime minister emphasised that the government's so-called fiscal rules \u2013 the parameters they set themselves on borrowing to appear credible \u2013 are non-negotiable.",

      "And then, enter next, artificial intelligence, an industrial revolution whirring on countless hard drives and computer chips.",
      "The prime minister has a zeal to harness its opportunities.",
      "You bet he has, you might think: perhaps he can get more for less from public services with whizzy computers doing things better and quicker, or so the theory goes, than human beings.",
      "Perhaps too, as many expect, it will revolutionise the economy \u2013 as well as everything else \u2013 transforming productivity and boosting economic growth.",

    "story": [
      "It has not been a good week for Chancellor Rachel Reeves.",
      "Government borrowing costs have hit their highest level in 16 years and the pound has fallen to a 14-month low against the dollar.",
      "She has gone on a planned trip to China amid accusations from opposition parties that she is leaving at a moment of economic peril.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is accompanying her on the trip. The 12-hour flight to Beijing is probably the length of the meeting she might have wanted to have with him.",
      "So how serious are the recent movements on the markets and what could happen as a result?",
      "Budget plans need to be tweaked",
      "While the markets stabilised from Thursday lunchtime, the move against UK government debt is already enough to cause a problem for the chancellor's Budget maths.",
      "Reeves has pledged not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament. The Treasury has said these fiscal rules, set out in the Budget, are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "At times over the past week the markets have looked pretty fragile for Britain, with both government borrowing costs going up and sterling falling back at the same time. That is a key marker.",
      "While it's true that the overall direction for the markets over the past month has been set by an assessment of the inflationary consequences of President-elect Trump's trade and economic policies, the UK has been getting some special attention in addition.",
      "It risks being tarred with both the inflationary stickiness of the US, and the stagnant growth of the eurozone - the worst of both worlds.",
      "That said, it is important to be precise about the extent of the problem. The extra cost of servicing the national debt at these interest rates would be several billion pounds a year - i.e. material enough to require some sort of correction in the Budget maths, but doable, and the clear message this week is that \"it will be done\".",
      "No impact on mortgages so far",
      "The impact on budgetary maths is real, but the wider impact that might be expected - of higher borrowing costs for companies and for households - has not yet materialised.",
      "The mortgage market has yet to see an increase in rates for fixed-term mortgages, as occurred rapidly in the panic after the 2022 mini-Budget. There is a curious calm.",
      "One explanation lies in what is not happening. This time last year the major lenders greatly discounted mortgages in a battle for market share ahead of the key moments for house buying. This has not happened this year, and may yet have a consequence in the property market.",
      "The Bank of England has indicated it will continue with interest rate cuts this year. The markets think there may be far fewer than previously expected, perhaps only one, leaving base interest rates at 4.5%.",
      "Many economists say this is the wrong call, and believe rates will be cut multiple times. There's quite a lot of uncertainty here, and the key Bank of England committee is split. The Bank's words will be very carefully watched.",
      "More positively for the economy, despite a lot of rhetoric from retailers, many have delivered strong results and have not lowered their profits expectations. Are consumers a bit more robust than had been assumed, and could this drive some growth in 2025?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?",
      "Growth strategy needs a reboot",
      "The problem of servicing higher interest payments on the national debt increases the likelihood of the Treasury making plans for an adjustment, based on a squeeze on spending. A \u00a310bn cut will hurt, but with a majority of 170 MPs in the House of Commons, and an ongoing spending review already in train, it can be done.",
      "In these circumstances, with the credible threat of a global trade war, for example, it should be noted that Rachel Reeves' new fiscal rules do have an escape hatch.",
      "In the event of \"an emergency or a significant negative economic shock to the economy\" the chancellor may \"temporarily suspend the fiscal mandate\".",
      "While a global trade war could qualify, it would be difficult optics to suspend a \"non-negotiable\" and \"iron-clad\" set of rules before they had really bitten. The rules have not yet formally passed into law yet either, and remain a \"draft\" until the Commons votes to approve them.",
      "It seems very unlikely that this route will be taken unless there is a very clear economic shock in the coming weeks.",
      "The bigger point here is what matters in the markets, which is whether the UK is pursuing a credible set of policies, a convincing overall strategy.",
      "Labour's focus on stability at all costs was understandable after the humiliation of Liz Truss's mini-Budget. But \"stability\" is not a growth strategy.",

    "summary": "DNA analysis suggests Iron Age societies in Britain were built around women rather than men.",
    "story": [
      "Women in Britain 2,000 years ago appear to have passed on land and wealth to daughters not sons as communities were built around women's blood lines, according to new research.",
      "Skeletons unearthed in Dorset contained DNA evidence that Celtic men moved to live with their wives' families and communities.",
      "Scientists found evidence of a whole community built around the female line of a family over generations, probably originating with one woman.",
      "\"This points to an Iron Age society in Britain where women wielded quite a lot of influence and could shape its trajectory in many ways,\" says Dr Lara Cassidy at Trinity College, Dublin, lead author of the research.",
      "It is the first time this evidence of communities being built around women has been documented in ancient European history.",
      "The scientists believe that the communities also invested a lot in their daughters as they would probably inherit their mother's status.",
      "\"It's relatively rare in modern societies, but this might not always have been the case,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "The team found evidence that it happened in numerous places in Britain, suggesting it was widespread.",
      "The communities analysed lived around the same time as Boudica, the warrior Queen who led a rebellion against Roman invaders in East Anglia around AD 61.",
      "Dr Cassidy sequenced DNA taken from the bones of 57 individuals from a tribe called the Durotriges. The people lived in Winterborne Kingston, Dorset around 100 BC to AD 100.",
      "The skeletons were dug up from a cemetery by a team of archaeologists at Bournemouth University.",
      "By tracing mitochondrial DNA, which is only passed on by women, Dr Cassidy found that most women in the community were related by blood dating back generations.",
      "By contrast, there was a lot of diversity in the Y chromosomes, which is passed from father to son, indicating that men from lots of different families married into the community.",
      "The DNA analysis also indicates that most of the ancestral line could be traced back to a single woman.",
      "The work indicates that this society was what is known as matrilocal - meaning that a married man moved to live in his wife's community.",
      "\"The most sort of obvious benefit to a woman is that if you don't leave home, you don't leave your support network. Your parents, siblings, family members are all still around you,\" says Dr Cassidy.",
      "\"It's your husband who's coming in, he's the relative stranger to the community, and he's dependent on your family for his livelihood and land,\" she adds.",
      "The researchers found the same matrilocality evidence in bones from other cemeteries including in Cornwall and Yorkshire.",
      "She says that evidence of powerful women in ancient communities has often been dismissed an a one-off, not the norm, but these findings challenge that thinking.",
      "Archaeologists Prof Miles Russell and Prof Martin Smith found other evidence that women had high status.",
      "\"We find quite elaborately furnished graves with high status objects of wealth. Every time we find that, it occurs in women's graves, so we think wealth was being transferred down the female line,\" says Prof Martin Smith at Bournemouth university.",
      "The findings also back up Roman writings at the time which suggested that women in Britain were quite powerful, more so than in Rome.",
      "But Romans like Julius Caeser viewed that as a sign of backwardness.",
      "\"Women in Britain had power and it was a more egalitarian place. That was the biggest problem that Romans had with the Britons because Rome was a deeply patriarchal society. To them, it marked Britons as the ultimate Barbarians,\" says Professor Miles Russell at Bournemouth University.",
      "The majority of societies today are patrilocal, meaning women move to their husband's communities.",
      "But some matrilocal communities exist today or in the recent past, including the Akans in Ghana, West Africa and Cherokee in North America.",
      "The scientists say that Iron Age Britain may have been matrilocal because men were frequently away fighting.",
      "Dr Cassidy compares it to World War Two when women gained more political and economic power.",
      "Matrilocal societies are also less likely to experience internal conflict, she says.",
      "\"It can promote feelings of unity among neighbouring communities and villages. It disperses groups of related males, stopping groups of related males developing strong loyalties and starting feuds with the related males nearby,\" she suggests.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "Listen to Pallab read this story",
      "In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.",
      "Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.",
      "This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.",
      "It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.",
      "But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?",
      "And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.",
      "A crazy idea 'that works'",
      "Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. \"It's a crazy idea,\" he admits to me, \"but it works.\"",
      "Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.",
      "The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.",
      "The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.",
      "Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. \"We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.",
      "\"But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Tech advances at break-neck speed",
      "If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.",
      "But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.",
      "One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.",
      "\"Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,\" she tells me. \"It's an extremely fast-moving field.\"",
      "One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.",
      "The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.",
      "However all those possibilities require funding.",
      "A national priority?",
      "The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of \u00a32bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.",
      "On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.",
      "The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.",
      "\"We are looking for products like this handbag,\" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.",
      "Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.",
      "\"They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,\" she continues.",
      "\"Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.\"",
      "Losing out to Korea and the US",
      "In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.",
      "In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.",
      "The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a new House of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.",
      "It states that \"other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector\".",

      "Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, \"we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea\".",
      "She said: \"We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.",
      "\"If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brain drain",
      "Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.",
      "\"The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.\"",
      "According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.",
      "\"All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,\" she says. \"This requires urgent action\".",
      "Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (\u00a382m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (\u00a3614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.",
      "\"Our biofoundry in London had \u00a37m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash\".",
      "Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.",
      "'Living pollution' that could spread",
      "A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.",
      "\"Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.\"",
      "In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.",
      "But \"streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances\", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.",
      "Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.",
      "But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. \"There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.",
      "\"This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences\".",
      "Inadvertent creation of superbugs",
      "Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.",
      "Most worrisome is the inadvertent creation of superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.",
      "A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of \"mirror life\", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.",
      "Writing in the journal Science, they said that these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.",
      "But the problem is that the technology has become so cheap and widely available that such a moratorium would be hard to police. And while the creation of mirror life is a highly specialised skill, bad actors could make simpler changes, increasing the risk of bioterrorism.",
      "Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.",
      "Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. \"We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.",
      "\"The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology\".",

      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",

      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",

      "On the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.",
      "The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.",
      "Last year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.",
      "And 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed.",
      "In some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.",
      "By contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.",
      "In the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.",

      "\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"",
      "The support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.",
      "\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.",
      "Even though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.",
      "\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"",
      "Key to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.",
      "Rather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.",
      "A string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.",
      "By comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.",
      "Petrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.",
      "For many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.",

      "\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"",
      "Another driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"",
      "At Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.",
      "This compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.",
      "That means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.",
      "Tesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year. Meanwhile, Chinese-owned marques - such as MG, BYD, Polestar and XPeng - now make up a combined 10% of the market, according to the Norwegian Road Federation.",
      "Norway, unlike the US and EU, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EV imports.",

      "Norwegians aren't more environmentally-minded than people elsewhere, she reckons. \"I don't think a green mindset has much to do with it. It has to do with strong policies, and people gradually understanding that driving an electric car is possible.\"",
      "Yet Norway is also a very wealthy nation, which thanks to its huge oil and gas exports, has a sovereign wealth fund worth more than $1.7tn (\u00a31.3tn). This means it can more easily afford big infrastructure-build projects, and absorb the loss of tax revenue from the sale of petrol and diesel cars and their fuel.",

    "title": "2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit",
    "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2025 04:13:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Last year was the world's warmest on record, bringing temperatures above a politically symbolic milestone.",
    "story": [
      "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.",
      "The European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.",
      "This does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.",
      "Last week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\".",
      "\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.",
      "Global average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.",
      "This breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.",
      "The Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.",
      "Last year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs.",
      "Natural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.",
      "\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "The 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.",
      "The risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.",
      "Yet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.",
      "\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.",
      "The current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.",
      "\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.",
      "Even fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.",
      "In 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.",
      "These events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.",
      "Even this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.",
      "While there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.",
      "It wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.",
      "That the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.",
      "But the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.",
      "\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.",
      "Various theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end of El Ni\u00f1o.",
      "\"The question is whether this acceleration is something persistent linked to human activities that means we will have steeper warming in the future, or whether it is a part of natural variability,\" Dr G\u00f6\u00dfling adds.",
      "\"At the moment it's very hard to say.\"",
      "Despite this uncertainty, scientists stress that humans still have control over the future climate, and sharp reductions in emissions can lessen the consequences of warming.",
      "\"Even if 1.5 degrees is out the window, we still can probably limit warming to 1.6C, 1.7C or 1.8C this century,\" says Dr Hausfather.",
      "\"That's going to be far, far better than if we keep burning coal, oil and gas unabated and end up at 3C or 4C - it still really matters.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:00:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he does not want the law to come into force, asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "But, should the justices uphold it, Trump does not have the power to overturn the law, which would come into effect the day before he returns to office.",
      "But he could simply tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok."

      "According to SEC rules, investors whose holdings surpass 5% have 10 days to report that they have crossed that threshold. Musk did so 21 days after the purchase, the filing says.",
      "In a social media post, Musk called the SEC a \"totally broken organisation.\"",

      "It is the latest in a series of investigations Google faces worldwide.",
      "In the US, the government wants it to sell its browser, Chrome, to address what a judged ruled was its illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.",

      "On Saturday, Ian Russell, the father of Molly Russell, who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the UK was \"going backwards\" on the issue.",
      "In a letter to the PM, Mr Russell argued that the Online Safety Act, which aims to force tech giants to take more responsibility for their sites' content, needed fixing and said a \"duty of care\" should be imposed on the firms.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Kyle expressed his \"frustration\" with the Act, which was passed by the previous Conservative government in 2023.",
      "The Conservative government had originally included in the legislation plans to compel social media companies to remove some \"legal-but-harmful\" content, such as posts promoting eating disorders.",
      "However the proposal triggered a backlash from critics, including the current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who were concerned it could lead to censorship.",

      "The plan was dropped for adult social media users and instead companies were required to give users more control to filter out content they did not want to see. The law still expects companies to protect children from legal-but-harmful content.",
      "Kyle said the section on legal-but-harmful content had been taken out of the bill adding: \"So I inherited a landscape where we have a very uneven, unsatisfactory legislative settlement.\"",
      "He did not commit to making changes to the current legislation but said he was \"very open-minded\" on the subject.",

      "He said Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Meta which owns Facebook and Instagram, and Elon Musk, owner of the social media site X, were \"at the leading edge of a wholesale recalibration of the industry\".",
      "He accused Zuckerberg of moving away from safety towards a \"laissez-faire, anything-goes model\" and \"back towards the harmful content that Molly was exposed to\".",
      "Earlier this week, Zuckerberg said Meta would be getting rid of fact checkers, and instead adopt a system \u2013 already introduced by X - of allowing users to add \"community notes\" to social media posts they deemed to be untrue.",
      "This marked a change from Meta's previous approach, introduced in 2016, whereby third party moderators would check posts on Facebook and Instagram that appeared to be false or misleading.",
      "Content flagged as inaccurate would be moved lower in users' feeds and accompanied by labels offering viewers more information on the subject.",
      "Defending the new system, Zuckerberg said moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The step comes as Meta seeks to improve relations with incoming US President Donald Trump who has previously accused the company of censoring right-wing voices.",
      "Zuckerberg said the change - which only applies in the US - would mean content moderators would \"catch less bad stuff\" but would also reduce the number of \"innocent\" posts being removed.",
      "Responding to Russell's criticism, a Meta spokesperson told the BBC there was \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\" and said the company would \"continue to use our automated systems to scan for that high-severity content\".",
      "Asked about the change, Kyle said the announcement was \"an American statement for American service users\" adding: \"There is one thing that has not changed and that is the law of this land.\"",
      "\"If you come and operate in this country you abide by the law, and the law says illegal content must be taken down,\" he said.",
      "Rules in the Online Safety Act, due to come into force later this year, compel social media firms to show that they are removing illegal content - such as child sexual abuse, material inciting violence and posts promoting or facilitating suicide.",
      "The law also says companies have to protect children from harmful material including pornography, material promoting self-harm, bullying and content encouraging dangerous stunts.",
      "Platforms will be expected to adopt \"age assurance technologies\" to prevent children from seeing harmful content.",
      "The law also requires companies to take action against illegal, state-sponsored disinformation. If their services are likely to be accessed by children they should also take steps to protect users against misinformation."

      "One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.",
      "Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.",
      "\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.",
      "\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.",
      "\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d",
      "He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d",
      "But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?",
      "Mr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.",
      "\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d",
      "Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.",
      "\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.",
      "The AI is trained on published medical research papers.",
      "\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d",
      "She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.",
      "An AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.",
      "In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.",
      "\"Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.\u201d",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Could AI help prevent diabetes-related sight loss?",
      "Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.",
      "\"There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,\u201d says Ms Dennis.",
      "\u201cAI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use \u2013 which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.\u201d",
      "She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.",
      "\u201cThe NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.\"",
      "For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. \u201cIt has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.\u201d"

    "summary": "Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.",
    "story": [
      "This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.",
      "It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.",
      "The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials has shown impressive efficacy in treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).",
      "It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.",
      "\"We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,\" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. \"But we may be the furthest along the path.\"",
      "Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.",
      "That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.",
      "Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.",
      "Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.",
      "Using AI to do drug discovery could make an \"enormous difference\" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).",
      "Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).",
      "It's also risky: about 90% of drugs that go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.",
      "A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.",
      "\"We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,\" she says.",
      "It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.",
      "A recently published analysis by BCG found at least 75 \"AI-discovered molecules\" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.",
      "\"That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,\" says Dr Meier. The next \u2013 and \"even bigger milestone\" \u2013 will be when they start to come out the other end.",
      "However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an \"AI discovered\" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.",
      "There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.",
      "The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.",
      "While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.",
      "The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.",
      "This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.",
      "Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.",
      "In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.",
      "All have been \"discovered from scratch using generative AI\", says Dr Zhavoronkov. \"Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.\"",
      "The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.",
      "Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.",
      "The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.",
      "It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.",
      "The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.",
      "That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.",
      "US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.",
      "Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.",
      "To help to do that, last year it installed what it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.",
      "It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.",
      "It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.",
      "Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.",
      "When that happens, says Dr Gibson, \"it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go\"."

      "US President Joe Biden said it would \"halt the fighting in Gaza, surge much needed-humanitarian assistance to Palestinian civilians, and reunite the hostages with their families\".",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal's final details were still being worked on, but he thanked Biden for \"promoting\" it. Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya said it was the result of Palestinian \"resilience\".",
      "Many Palestinians and Israeli hostages' families celebrated the news, but there was no let up in the war on the ground in Gaza.",
      "The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported Israeli air strikes killed more than 20 people following the Qatari announcement. They included 12 people who were living in a residential block in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City, it said.  There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.",
      "Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "More than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to a struggle to get aid to those in need.",

      "Israeli forces will also withdraw to the east away from densely populated areas of Gaza, displaced Palestinians will be allowed to begin returning to their homes and hundreds of aid lorries will be allowed into the territory each day.",
      "Negotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a return to \"sustainable calm\" - will start on the 16th day.",
      "The third and final stage will involve the reconstruction of Gaza - something which could take years - and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies.",
      "Sheikh Mohammed said there was \"a clear mechanism to negotiate phase two and three\", with the agreements set to be published \"in the next couple of days, once the details are finalised\".",
      "He also said Qatar, the US and Egypt, which also helped broker the deal, would work together to ensure Israel and Hamas fulfilled their obligations.",
      "\"We hope that this will be the last page of the war, and we hope that all parties will commit to implementing all the terms of this agreement,\" he added.",
      "President Biden said the plan, which he first outlined eight months ago, was \"the result not only of the extreme pressure Hamas has been under and the changed regional equation after a ceasefire in Lebanon and the weakening of Iran - but also of dogged and painstaking American diplomacy\".",
      "\"Even as we welcome this news, we remember all the families whose loved ones were killed in Hamas's 7 October attack, and the many innocent people killed in the war that followed,\" a statement added. \"It is long past time for the fighting to end and the work of building peace and security to begin.\"",
      "At a later news conference, Biden also acknowledged the assistance of President-elect Donald Trump, who put pressure on both parties by demanding hostages be released before his inauguration on Monday.",
      "\"In these past few days, we've been speaking as one team,\" he said, noting that most of the implementation of the deal would happen after he left office.",
      "Trump was first to confirm reports the agreement had been reached, beating the White House and Qatar to a formal announcement.",
      "In a later post on social media, he attempted to take the credit for the \"epic\" agreement, saying it \"could have only happened as a result of our historic victory in November\".",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office thanked Trump \"for his help in promoting the release of the hostages, and for helping Israel end the suffering of dozens of hostages and their families\".",
      "\"The prime minister made it clear that he is committed to returning all the hostages by any means necessary,\" it said, before adding that he had also thanked Biden.",
      "Later, the office said an official statement from Netanyahu would \"be issued only after the completion of the final details of the agreement, which are being worked on at present\".",
      "Israel's President, Isaac Herzog, said the deal would bring with it \"deeply painful\" moments and \"present significant challenges\", but that it was \"the right move\".",

      "Hamas's chief negotiator and acting Gaza chief, Khalil al-Hayya, said the agreement represented \"a milestone in the conflict with the enemy, on the path to achieving our people's goals of liberation and return\".",
      "The group, he added, would now seek to \"rebuild Gaza again, alleviate the pain, heal the wounds\".",

      "Investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) failed to arrest him on 3 January after being locked in a six-hour stand-off with his security detail.",
      "But just before dawn on Wednesday, a much larger team of investigators and police arrived at his residence in central Seoul, armed with ladders to climb over buses blocking its entrance and bolt cutters to remove barbed wire.",
      "Other officers in the arrest team, which numbered around 1,000, scaled walls and hiked up nearby trails to reach the presidential residence.",
      "After several hours, authorities announced that Yoon had been arrested.",
      "In a three-minute video released just before his arrest, the 64-year-old leader said he would co-operate with the investigators, while repeating previous claims that the warrant was not legally valid.",
      "\"I decided to appear before the CIO, even though it is an illegal investigation, in order to prevent any unsavoury bloodshed,\" he said, adding that he witnessed officials \"invade\" his home's security perimeter with fire equipment.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, investigators said Yoon had remained silent throughout questioning.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have said his arrest was \"illegal\" because the CIO, as an anti-corruption agency, has no power to investigate the insurrection allegations against Yoon. They also claim the warrant was issued by the wrong jurisdiction.",
      "The same court later dismissed an injunction filed by President Yoon to invalidate the arrest warrant, which the authorities maintain is lawful.",

      "The president said he was protecting the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea, but it soon became clear that he was spurred by his own political troubles.",
      "Yoon has been a lame duck president since the opposition won the general election last April by a landslide - his government has been reduced to vetoing bills proposed by the opposition.",

      "The primetime programme, which aired on Sunday, attracted national attention on interior designer Anne, 53, who thought she was in a relationship with Pitt for a year and a half.",
      "She has since told a popular French YouTube show that she was not \"crazy or a moron\": \"I just got played, I admit it, and that's why I came forward, because I am not the only one.\"",
      "A representative for Pitt told US outlet Entertainment Weekly that it was \"awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities\" and that people shouldn't respond to unsolicited online outreach \"especially from actors who have no social media presence.\"",
      "Hundreds of social media users mocked Anne, who the programme said had lost her life's savings and tried to take her own life three times since the scam came to light.",
      "Netflix France put out a post on X advertising \"four films with Brad Pitt (for real)\", while, in a now-deleted post, Toulouse FC said: \"Hi Anne, Brad told us he would be at the stadium on Wednesday... and you?\"",
      "The club has since apologised for the post.",
      "On Tuesday, TF1 said it had pulled the segment on Anne after her testimony had sparked \"a wave of harassment\" - although the programme can still be found online.",
      "In the report, Anne said her ordeal began when she downloaded Instagram in February 2023, when she was still married to a wealthy entrepreneur.",
      "She was immediately contacted by someone who said they were Pitt's mother, Jane Etta, who told Anne her son \"needed a woman just like her\".",
      "Somebody purporting to be Pitt got in touch the next day, which set off alarm bells for Anne. \"But as someone who isn't very used to social media, I didn't really know what was happening to me,\" she said.",
      "At one point, \"Brad Pitt\" said he tried to send her luxury gifts but that he was unable to pay customs on them as his bank accounts were frozen due to his divorce proceedings with actor Angelina Jolie, prompting Anne to transfer \u20ac9000 to the scammers.",
      "\"Like a fool, I paid... Every time I doubted him, he managed to dissipate my doubts,\" she said.",
      "The requests for money ramped up when the fake Pitt told Anne he needed cash to pay for kidney cancer treatment, sending her multiple AI-generated photos of Brad Pitt in a hospital bed. \"I looked those photos up on the internet but couldn't find them so I thought that meant he had taken those selfies just for me,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Anne and her husband divorced, and she was awarded \u20ac775,000 - all of which went to the scammers.",
      "\"I told myself I was maybe saving a man's life,\" Anne said, who is in cancer remission herself.",
      "Anne's daughter, now 22, told TF1 she tried to \"get her mother to see reason\" for over a year but that her mother was too excited. \"It hurt to see how naive she was being,\" she said.",
      "When images appeared in gossip magazines showing the real Brad Pitt with his new girlfriend Ines de Ramon, awakening suspicions in Anne, the scammers sent her an fake news report in which the AI-generated anchor talked about Pitt's \"exclusive relationship with one special individual... who goes by the name of Anne.\"",
      "The video comforted Anne for a short time, but when the real Brad Pitt and Ines de Ramon made their relationship official in June 2024, Anne decided to end things.",
      "After scammers tried to get more money out of her under the guise of \"Special FBI Agent John Smith,\" Anne contacted the police. An investigation is now under way.",
      "The TF1 programme said the events left Anne broke, and that she has tried to end her life three times.",
      "\"Why was I chosen to be hurt this way?,\" a tearful Anne said. \"These people deserve hell. We need to find those scammers, I beg you - please help me find them.\"",
      "But in the YouTube interview on Tuesday Anne hit back at TF1, saying it had left out details on her repeated doubts over whether she was talking to the real Brad Pitt, and added that anyone could've fallen for the scam if they were told \"words that you never heard from your own husband.\"",
      "Anne said she was now living with a friend: \"My whole life is a small room with some boxes. That's all I have left.\"",
      "While many online users overwhelmingly mocked Anne, several took her side.",
      "\"I understand the comic effect but we're talking about a woman in her 50s who got conned by deepfakes and AI which your parents and grandparents would be incapable to spot,\" one popular post on X read.",
      "An op-ed in newspaper Lib\u00e9ration said Anne was a \"whistleblower\": \"Life today is paved with cybertraps... and AI progress will only worsen this scenario.\""

      "No more illegal miners are believed to be trapped underground at a gold mine in South Africa, volunteers working with rescue teams have said.",
      "At least 78 bodies and more than 200 survivors have been pulled out since Monday after a court ordered the government to facilitate rescue operations at the mine, the site of one of the most extraordinary tragedies to hit the industry.",
      "Police said they would check that no-one was left on Thursday, when a rescue cage would be sent down the mine.",
      "The stand-off began in November when the government ordered police to arrest any miner who surfaced, saying it was determined to end illegal mining.",
      "",
      "This story contains a video that some people may find distressing.",
      "During a visit on Tuesday, the police and mines ministers were insulted and told to leave by an angry crowd that blamed the government for the deaths.",
      "Police said that more than 1,500 miners had come to the surface before the rescue operation began, Reuters news agency reports.",
      "However, others remained underground, either because they feared arrest or were forced to stay there by gangs that control the mine.",
      "A South African Police Service spokesman said of the volunteers' statement that no-one was now still underground: \"We will rely on the Mine Rescue Service to confirm this with their state-of-the-art equipment that will hopefully be able to give us a picture of what is happening underground.",

      "The mines have been taken over by gangs, often former employees, that sell minerals they find on the black market.",
      "This includes the mine in Stilfontein, some 145km (90 miles) south-west of the country's biggest city, Johannesburg, which has been the focus of government efforts to clamp down on the illegal industry.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 17:42:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Daniel Chapo's legitimacy has been questioned following protests against his victory.",
    "story": [
      "Mozambique's new President Daniel Chapo has been sworn in at a low-key ceremony in the capital, Maputo, that was marred by an opposition boycott following heavily disputed elections.",
      "In his first presidential address, Chapo, 47, pledged to \"devote all my energies\" to promoting unity and human rights in a nation scarred by post-election violence.",
      "A local civil society group says that more than 300 people have been killed in clashes with security forces since elections in October.",
      "Eight people were killed by police on Wednesday as they protested against the inauguration, Dr Wilker Dias, head of election observer group Plataforma Decide told the BBC.",
      "Most of the victims were supporters of defeated presidential candidate Ven\u00e2ncio Mondlane, who had called for a national strike in defiance of Chapo taking office.",
      "In light of Mondlane's appeal, most businesses in Maputo were shut on Wednesday and the streets were largely deserted.",
      "Chapo had won the election with 65% of the vote, extending the 49-year-rule of the Frelimo party.",
      "Mondlane - who contested the election as an independent - came second with 24% of the vote. He rejected the result, saying it was rigged and called for a strike on inauguration day \"against the thieves of the people\".",
      "Addressing about 2,500 guests at the heavily guarded ceremony, Chapo said that \"together, we will restore patriotism and pride in being Mozambican\".",
      "\"Mozambique cannot remain a hostage to corruption, nepotism, and incompetence,\" he added.",
      "Police fired shots to disperse crowds outside Independence Square, where the ceremony was held, as Chapo's motorcade left afterwards.",
      "The crowds were mostly of Mondlane's supporters, but they included some who backed Chapo. Both groups had earlier tried to enter the venue but were barred from doing so.",
      "\"Is this a wedding with private invitations? We want to see the president being sworn in but we have been told we can't,\" Maputo resident Paulu Hamuze told the BBC.",
      "Mondlane's electoral campaign was backed by a small opposition party, which heeded his call for a boycott of the inauguration.",
      "Both of Mozambique's leading opposition parties \u2013 Renamo and MDM \u2013  also boycotted the swearing-in because they also do not recognise Chapo as the rightful winner.",
      "Chapo succeeds Filipe Nyusi, who has stepped down at the end of his two terms.",
      "Even those in Mozambique who wish Chapo well openly question his legitimacy, or whether he will be able to tackle the problems he has identified.",
      "\"Chapo is someone I admire greatly,\" civil society activist Mirna Chitsungo tells the BBC.",
      "\"I worked with him for four years - I am familiar with his willingness to act, his openness to dialogue, and his readiness to follow recommendations from civil society on the ground.\"",
      "\"However, he is assuming an illegitimate power. This stems from a fraudulent electoral process... He is taking power in a context where the people do not accept him.\"",
      "'He will face many enemies'",
      "In addition to winning over a hostile public, Chapo will also have to deliver the economic turnaround and halt to corruption that he promised on the campaign trail.",
      "\"Chapo will face many enemies because it looks like Mozambique is run by cartels, including cartels of books, cartel of medicines, cartel of sugar, cartel of drugs, cartel of kidnappings, mafia groups,\" says analyst and investigative journalist Luis Nhanchote.",
      "\"He needs to have a strong team of experts, willing to join him in this crusade of dismantling the groups meticulously,\" he adds.",
      "\"But first, he has to calm down Mozambicans and do all in his power to restore peace in the country.\"",
      "Daniel Francisco Chapo was born on 6 January 1977 in Inhaminga, a town in Sofala province, the sixth of 10 siblings. This was during Mozambique's civil war, and the armed conflict forced his family to move to another nearby district.",
      "His secondary schooling in the coastal city of Beira was followed by a law degree from Eduardo Mondlane University then a master's degree in development management from the Catholic University of Mozambique.",
      "Now married to Gueta Sulemane Chapo, with whom he has three children, Chapo is also said to be a church-going Christian and fan of basketball and football.",
      "Many current and former colleagues describe Chapo as humble, hard-working and a patient leader.",
      "Ahead of becoming the ruling Frelimo party's presidential candidate, he had been a radio and television host, a legal notary, university lecturer and provincial governor before rising to the post of Frelimo general secretary.",
      "Speaking at his recent birthday celebrations, Chapo himself acknowledged the daunting challenge awaiting him as president.",
      "\"We must recover our country economically... it's easy to destroy, but building is not an easy task.\"",
      "National reconciliation, creating more jobs, reforming electoral law and decentralising power are top of his agenda, he said.",
      "But how successful can he be without much of the country behind him?",
      "At the very least he will mark a change from outgoing President Felipe Nyusi, whom Ms Chitsungo says many Mozambicans will be happy to see the back of.",
      "\"Chapo is a figure of dialogue and consensus, not one to perpetuate Nyusi's violent governance style. He has the potential to negotiate with Mondlane.",
      "\"While Chapo may not fully satisfy all of Mondlane's demands, I believe he could meet at least 50% of them,\" adds Ms Chitsungo.",
      "Mondlane - a part-time pastor who insists he was the true winner of the polls - is reported to be sheltering in one of Maputo's hotels after returning from self-imposed exile.",
      "It is not known what security protection he has there, nor who is paying for it.",
      "He alleges that last week, while touring a market in Maputo, a vendor in his vicinity was shot, echoing the murder of two of his close aides in October.",
      "As the mastermind of nationwide protests against the disputed election result, he has come to be seen by many as a voice for the voiceless. Yet, at present, the president-elect's camp is not engaging him publicly.",
      "Nonetheless, listening to the public's grievances and demands, and sometimes ignoring the commands of his ruling Frelimo party, will be key to Chapo's success, analysts have told the BBC.",
      "Finding some way of engaging constructively with Mondlane would undoubtedly provide a boost, they say.",
      "Winning the public over may also require Chapo to say no to \"fat salaries for the elite and fringe benefits, some of which are 10 times higher than Mozambique's minimum wage\", argues Mr Nhachote.",
      "Plus, if Chapo is to have any chance of bringing an end to the broader political crisis, he will require support from others to make lasting, structural change, argues prominent clergymen Rev Anastacio Chembeze.",
      "\"Perhaps we should remain sceptical of one single person to solve the challenges of Mozambique \u2013 change must start within the system itself.",
      "\"We should strive for a separation of powers within the state apparatus, the international monopolies have huge interests in the country, and we have serious ethical issues within the political elites to address it.\"",
      "Once in office, Chapo should sack the country's Police Chief Bernadino Rafael, analysts have told the BBC. He denies any wrongdoing but is regarded by some as the mastermind behind the brutal response to the post-election protests.",
      "They say they want him replaced with a successor who \"respects human rights\" and follows legal and international standards. Another suggestion analysts have touted is for a new attorney-general to be brought in.",
      "Chapo will be the first president of Mozambique who did not fight in the independence war.",
      "\"He is part of the new generation. Part of his background is completely different from his predecessors - he was born in a country liberated by them,\" says Mr Nhachote.",
      "\"If he wants to make a real mark on history, he has to challenge those past icons. If he can't [manage that], I am sure that he will only run for one term.\"",

    "summary": "The rapper withdraws a case accusing his label of artificially boosting the success of Not Like Us.",
    "story": [
      "Rap superstar Drake is suing Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of the Kendrick Lamar diss track Not Like Us last year.",
      "The song, which formed part of a furious back and forth between the two stars, accused Drake and his entourage of being \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "Universal has yet to respond to the allegations.",
      "The move comes just 24 hours after Drake withdrew a separate legal action against UMG and Spotify,  in which he accused the two companies of conspiring to artificially boost streams of Not Like Us, at the expense of his own music.",
      "In that case, he argued that Universal had licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to generate extra plays, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".",
      "In a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.\"",
      "It added that \"no amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments... can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\"",
      "Spotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\".",
      "The Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\".",
      "His lawyers withdrew the case on Tuesday, after meeting with representatives from both companies, according to court papers.",

      "Drake takes legal action over song's 'sex offender' claim",
      "The feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar explained",
      "That appeared to draw a line under the legal action - until the story took a dramatic twist on Wednesday morning.",
      "In a lawsuit filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of prioritising \"corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists\".",
      "His lawyers noted that the artwork for Not Like Us was based on an aerial photograph of Drake's $100m Toronto mansion, dotted with red markers that are often used to represent the presence of registered sex offenders.",
      "The court documents link that artwork to a shooting at the property shortly after the release of Kendrick's song, calling it \"the 2024 equivalent of 'Pizzagate'\".",
      "The comment referenced a conspiracy theory about a US child sex ring operating out of a Washington pizza restaurant, which led to a gunman opening fire on the eaterie in 2016.",
      "Not Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s.",
      "In the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent.",
      "However, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify.",
      "The song is nominated for five prizes, including record and song of the year, at the Grammy Awards on 3 February. A week later, Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "However, the new lawsuit is not aimed at Lamar himself, according to Drake's lawyers.",
      "\"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created Not Like Us,\" the court documents says.",
      "\"It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\""

      "\"We must now reach IIHF standards, and that is where our work is cut [out],\" he explained.",

      "The Ice Lions were started by a group of expats from the United States and Canada, who mounted a recruitment drive.",

    "story": [
      "Calling people obese is medically \"flawed\" - and the definition should be split into two, a report from global experts says.",
      "The term \"clinical obesity\" should be used for patients with a medical condition caused by their weight, while \"pre-clinically obese\" should be applied to those remaining fat but fit, although at risk of disease.",
      "This is better for patients than relying only on body mass index (BMI) - which measures whether they are a healthy weight for their height - to determine obesity.",
      "More than a billion people are estimated to be living with obesity worldwide and prescription weight-loss drugs are in high demand.",
      "The report, published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal, is supported by more than 50 medical experts around the world.",
      "\"Some individuals with obesity can maintain normal organ function and overall health, even long term, whereas others display signs and symptoms of severe illness here and now,\" Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, who chaired the expert group, said.",
      "\"Obesity is a spectrum,\" he added.",
      "The current, blanket definition means too many people are being diagnosed as obese but not receiving the most appropriate care, the report says.",
      "'I feel blessed to get weight-loss jab' - but can the NHS afford it for all?",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "Natalie, from Crewe, goes to the gym four times a week and has a healthy diet, but is still overweight.",
      "\"I would consider myself on the larger side, but I'm fit,\" she told the BBC 5 Live phone-in with Nicky Campbell.",
      "\"If you look at my BMI I'm obese, but if I speak to my doctor they say that I'm fit, healthy and there's nothing wrong with me.",
      "\"I'm doing everything I can to stay fit and have a long healthy life,\" she said.",
      "Richard, from Falmouth, said there is a lot of confusion around BMI.",

      "In Mike's opinion, you cannot be fat and fit - he says it is all down to diet.",
      "\"All these skinny jabs make me laugh, if you want to lose weight stop eating - it's easy.\"",
      "Currently, in many countries, obesity is defined as having a BMI over 30 - a measurement that estimates body fat based on height and weight.",
      "How is BMI calculated?",
      "It is calculated by dividing an adult's weight in kilograms by their height in metres squared.",
      "For example, if they are 70kg (about 11 stone) and 1.70m (about 5ft 7in):",
      "square their height in metres: 1.70 x 1.70 = 2.89divide their weight in kilograms by this amount: 70 \u00f7 2.89 = 24.22display the result to one decimal place: 24.2",

      "It measures whether someone is carrying too much weight - but not too much fat.",
      "So very muscular people, such as athletes, tend to have a high BMI but not much fat.",
      "The report says BMI is useful on a large scale, to work out the proportion of a population who are a healthy weight, overweight or obese.",
      "But it reveals nothing about an individual patient's overall health, whether they have heart problems or other illnesses, for example, and fails to distinguish between different types of body fat or measure the more dangerous fat around the waist and organs.",
      "Measuring a patient's waist or the amount of fat in their body, along with a detailed medical history, can give a much clearer picture than BMI, the report says.",
      "\"Obesity is a health risk - the difference is it's also an illness for some,\" Prof Rubino said.",
      "What are the two groups?",
      "Clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a disease, there will be signs of it affecting organs in the body - through heart disease, breathlessness, type 2 diabetes or joint pain - and a person's day-to-day activities. Treatment with drugs or surgery is likely.",
      "Pre-clinically obese",
      "When obesity is a risk to health - but not yet causing any illnesses, people should be offered weight-loss advice, counselling and monitoring, to reduce the chances of health problems developing.",
      "Doctors should also pay close attention to a patient's family history to see if they are at risk of particular diseases.",
      "At a time when drugs that reduce body weight by up to 20% are being prescribed on a large scale, the report says redefining obesity \"is all the more relevant\" because it \"improves the accuracy of diagnosis\".",
      "Access to weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro is often restricted to patients with a BMI over 30 and a weight-related health condition.",
      "Children's obesity expert Prof Louise Baur, from the University of Sydney, who contributed to the report, said the new approach would allow adults and children with obesity \"to receive more appropriate care\", while reducing the numbers being over-diagnosed and given unnecessary treatment.",
      "The Royal College of Physicians said the report laid a strong foundation \"for treating obesity with the same medical rigour and compassion as other chronic illnesses\".",

      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",

      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",

      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",

      "Many people in Somaliland are convinced that the United States, under the incoming presidency of Donald Trump, is poised to become the world's first country to recognise the self-declared republic.",
      "The territory declared independence 33 years ago after Somalia descended into civil war -  and in many ways has functioned as a de facto nation-state ever since.",
      "\"Donald is our saviour. He is a wise and practical man. God bless America,\" says university student Aisha Ismail, whose voice trembles with delight at the prospect.",
      "She is speaking to me from Hargeisa, Somaliland's capital  - a city 850km (530 miles) north of  Mogadishu, the seat of the Somali government.",
      "For those in Mogadishu, Somaliland is an indivisible part of Somalia.",

      "\"I am spitting fire.\"",
      "He is so angry because Ms Ismail's great expectation is not necessarily a pipe dream, at least in the long term.",
      "Powerful and influential Republicans are pushing for the same thing, including Congressman Scott Perry who last month introduced a bill proposing formal US recognition for Somaliland.",
      "It followed the publication in April 2023 of Project 2025, a roadmap for the second Trump presidency compiled by the prominent right-wing Heritage Foundation and more than 100 other conservative organisations",
      "The document mentions only two African territories in its sub-Saharan Africa section - Somaliland and Djibouti  - and proposes \"the recognition of Somaliland statehood as a hedge against the US's deteriorating position in Djibouti\".",
      "However, the fact that sub-Saharan Africa takes up less than two pages in the 900-plus page plan suggests the continent is very low on the priority list.",
      "Also, there is no guarantee the incoming administration will follow the blueprint, some of which Trump has already disavowed.",
      "But one thing is clear. The US has already started to change its stance on Somaliland, moving away from its Mogadishu-focused approach, known as the \"one-track\" Somalia policy.",
      "Somalia has cost the US dearly in financial, resource and human terms since the early 1990s when the bodies of 18 American servicemen were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu after US helicopters were shot down by Somali clan fighters.",
      "The battle, known as \"Black Hawk Down\", was America's worst in terms of casualties since the Vietnam War.",
      "\"Any move towards recognising Somaliland's independence would not only contravene Somalia's sovereignty but also destabilise the region by setting a dangerous precedent,\" says Somali State Minister for Foreign Affairs Ali Omar Balcad.",
      "The African Union and other global powers believe territorial integrity is paramount. Recognising Somaliland could set off a chain reaction with separatists across the world demanding recognition for the territories they claim.",
      "Balcad also highlighted concerns about a possible repeat of the first Trump administration's decision to withdraw from Somalia most American troops who had been fighting al-Shabab, regularly described as al-Qaeda's most successful affiliate.",
      "Under Joe Biden's presidency about 500 US troops have been stationed in Somalia - carrying out special operations and training an elite Somali force, Danab, which has proved more effective than the regular Somali army at rooting out al-Shabab.",
      "The Americans have an airbase at Baledogle, north-west of Mogadishu, and conduct regular airstrikes against Islamist insurgents.",
      "\"A withdrawal would create a significant security vacuum, emboldening terrorist groups and threatening the stability of not only Somalia but the broader Horn of Africa,\" Balcad warned.",
      "The minister's remarks are in a similar vein but more measured than Somalia's response to a deal between Somaliland and Ethiopia whereby recognition would reportedly be granted in exchange for sea access.",
      "I received late-night calls from Somalis who said they were unable to sleep over the controversial proposal.",
      "Somalia's then-Environment Minister Aden Ibrahim Aw Hirsi told me at the time: \"You are always going on about 'political bombshells' in your reporting.",
      "\"People here are talking about a political earthquake. This is far more serious. It is a tsunami.\"",
      "Turkey has since mediated an end to the feud but the fact that Somalia recently signed a $600,000 (\u00a3492,000) a year deal with top Washington lobbying firm, the BGR Group, suggests it is worried about relations with the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The US last month abstained from voting on a UN Security Council resolution to fund the latest incarnation of the African Union intervention force in Somalia.",
      "A key architect of Republican Africa thinking, especially when it comes to Somali issues, is Joshua Meservey, who recently moved from the Heritage Foundation to the right-leaning Hudson Institute.",
      "\"The case for Somaliland in US terms is very compelling,\" he argues. \"I think the question of recognition will definitely be discussed, although the guiding north star is what is best for US national interests in practical terms.\"",
      "Senior Africa officials under Trump mark one, including the former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Tibor Nagy, and Africa envoy, Peter Pham, are energetic supporters of Somaliland's independence.",
      "Like many American Republicans, Somaliland's Foreign Minister Abdirahman Dahir Adan sees the relationship in transactional terms.",
      "\"If the deal is good for us, we will take it. If the US wants a military base here we will give it to them.\"",
      "Recognition sympathisers argue that Somaliland is located at the site of several converging US interests - economic, military and strategic.",
      "Mr Meservey adds that the territory should be \"rewarded\" for adhering to democratic principles, not relying on foreign aid and having a small government.",
      "Its long coastline runs along one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.",
      "Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels may have replaced Somali pirates as the main disruptor of traffic in the area but the attacks remain a major threat to global trade and draw the region closer to the war in the Middle East.",
      "The scramble for foreign bases along the Horn of Africa's coast is of concern to the US, which established its largest military facility on the continent in Djibouti in 2002.",
      "Russia has its eyes on Port Sudan; the United Arab Emirates (UAE) used Eritrea's Assab to fight the Houthis and Djibouti is chock-a-block with foreign forces, including the Chinese, who not only have a well-placed military facility but also run the huge port.",
      "Turkey's largest base on foreign soil stretches along Somalia's coastline just south of Mogadishu.",
      "Dealing with a rising China is a top Trump priority.",
      "The US has accused the Chinese of interfering with its activities in Djibouti by shining lasers into the eyes of its air force pilots and is keen to move elsewhere.",
      "It also wants to disrupt China's Belt and Road Initiative, which is taking over much of Africa.",
      "The Red Sea port of Berbera, whether you see it as part of Somaliland or Somalia, has much to offer as an alternative.",
      "China is not there; indeed it is outraged that Taiwan in 2020 established diplomatic relations with the breakaway republic.",
      "The UAE, a key US ally, runs the recently expanded port and hopes it will rival Djibouti.",
      "During the Biden administration, top American officials, including the chief of US Africa Command (Africom), conducted site visits of Berbera, which has a 4km  runway ironically constructed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War.",
      "This was later identified by the US as an emergency landing site for space shuttles - interesting given Trump's ally Elon Musk's obsession with space.",
      "In 2022, the US National Defence Authorisation Act was amended to include Somaliland, enhancing security co-operation and potentially paving the way for stronger diplomatic and economic ties.",
      "Pro-recognition Republicans have presented Somaliland as a good business case, hoping to appeal to Trump's deal-making approach. Project 2025 used the term \"hedge\".",
      "A US-based Somaliland diplomat said: \"It depends how they sell it to him. They have to make it attractive; they have to seduce him.\"",
      "Whether he means it or not, bringing up the explosive issue of recognition would likely suit Trump the disruptor.",
      "It would certainly bring him attention and he could boast about being first.",
      "It would also enrage Somalia, a country he included in his reported 2018 list of \"shithole\" nations and a place to which he wants to deport undocumented Somalis, failed asylum seekers and criminals.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:37:52 GMT",
    "summary": "The country is deeply polarised by the president's attempt to impose martial law.",
    "story": [
      "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested.",
      "It was a moment that had been in the making for weeks - ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after a dramatic standoff.",
      "Yet, when the news of his arrest on came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty \u2013 and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament.",
      "\"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\"",
      "It's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there.",
      "For the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high.",
      "Hundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles.",
      "Yoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 \u2013 who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp.",
      "A starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers.",
      "Their jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\"",
      "The gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month.",
      "Yoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps.",
      "While some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him.",
      "Why has it been so hard to arrest S Korea's impeached president?",
      "A dawn stand-off, a human wall and a failed arrest: South Korea enters uncharted territory",
      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's arrested president?",
      "The growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation.",
      "The year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil \u2013 along with the devastating Jeju Air crash on 29 December \u2013 has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere.",
      "Yoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December.",
      "He never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings.",
      "Before that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant.",
      "On Wednesday, he released a video statement saying he would co-operate with the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) to avoid \"bloodshed\", while claiming their arrest warrant was not legally valid.",
      "It was a massive operation, which followed a warning from the CIO that the presidential security team could also be arrested if they tried to block Yoon's arrest again. Unlike last time, the CIO and police were successful in detaining Yoon, although it still took hours to negotiate.",
      "Once he left the presidential compound, the streets surrounding it began to empty. Protesters dispersed and the police barricades were removed.",
      "Some of Yoon's supporters moved to the CIO office where he is being questioned. They need another warrant to detain him for more than 48 hours.",
      "While Yoon's arrest has concluded the security standoff, it has not ended the rift that exists well beyond it in South Korea, which in recent decades has emerged as a leading global economy and beacon of democracy in Asia.",
      "\"Arresting the country's leader does not even make sense,\" declared one protester outside the presidential compound.",
      "An opposing voice countered: \"Executing the arrest warrant is a necessary step - Yoon attempted to undermine the country's democracy.\"",
      "Yoon himself continues to question whether the CIO has the right to arrest him \u2013 his lawyers say no, because insurrection is not a charge of corruption. But the CIO says that the insurrection is a form of abuse of power \u2013 a charge that is within their remit to investigate.",
      "What may appear to be a legal debate has veered deep into political territory, with both sides seeking to control the narrative.",
      "The swift impeachment of Yoon's immediate successor - Prime Minister Han Duck-soo \u2013 has already led to allegations that impeachment is being used as a political tool against Yoon's allies. And Yoon's impeachment trial getting under way this week has created more uncertainty.",
      "Public attention will be on what statements, if any, Yoon makes while he is detained or under trial.",

    "story": [
      "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.",
      "The findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon.",
      "The \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 to protect civilians and keep them out of harms way.",
      "On 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.",
      "The area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid.",
      "Local media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify.",
      "In a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area.",
      "Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "The conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war.",
      "BBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month.",
      "We also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May.",
      "Israel historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza.",
      "Gavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones.",
      "He added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\"",
      "\"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said.",
      "One resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties.",
      "\"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said. \"We have been denied the true sense of security, with fear dominating our lives.\"",
      "As Israel does not allow foreign reporters access to Gaza - apart from highly controlled, escorted trips with its military - international media, including the BBC, is reliant on imagery gathered by Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents.",
      "To track attacks within the IDF's \"humanitarian area\", BBC Verify monitored Palestinian social media channels and official IDF channels on Instagram, Telegram and X. Reports of strikes that included verified imagery from within the boundaries of the zone were then cross-referenced with local media reports to determine a reported death toll.",
      "It's important to note that death tolls cannot be verified based solely on videos and social media reports. BBC Verify analysis excluded reports of fatalities where there wasn't verifiable imagery which confirmed the incident happened within the IDF-defined boundaries of the \"humanitarian area\".",
      "BBC Verify reviewed more than 300 videos and photos posted since May in the \"humanitarian zone\". While it is not always possible to distinguish between fighters and civilians, the footage shows scores of people, including women and children, being pulled from rubble. Some appeared lifeless, while others were severely burned or had significant limb injuries, alongside collapsed buildings, destroyed tents and burnt-out cars.",
      "Seven of the documented strikes are reported to have killed 20 or more people each, with the most deadly on 13 July resulting in more than 90 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry, first responders and medics.",
      "The IDF later said Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif, was among the dead. Deif is accused of being one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks.",
      "Nine strikes occurred within 100m of buildings belonging to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, and four within 150m of the Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis.",
      "The IDF told BBC Verify the strikes were conducted \"against terrorists and terror infrastructures including rocket launchers, weapons warehouse and manufacturing sites, operational apartments, underground infrastructure, operational headquarters, and terrorists hideout.\"",
      "They also included links to six of their previously published statements about Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\".",
      "Residents in the zone also live under constant uncertainty. Including evacuation notices, the boundary of the \"humanitarian area\" has changed 20 times - and it has varied in size from around 7 km sq (2.7 sq miles) when it was first introduced to 72 km sq (27.8 sq miles) at its largest.",
      "The IDF said evacuation notices \"do not constitute as a reduction of the humanitarian zone. Once the danger has passed, the residents return\". But it's unclear how residents know it's safe to return, and the IDF has only twice posted to social media to explicitly say so. BBC Verify did not include strikes inside areas where evacuation notices were issued in our tally.",
      "While Israel's military has avoided using the term \"safe zone\", its statements have led civilians to interpret the \"humanitarian zone\" as such. IDF evacuation notices include language that tells civilians - like this one which was issued in mid-December - \"for your own safety, move immediately west to the humanitarian area\".",
      "It has also described the zone as being \"designated for humanitarian aid and shelters as part of the IDF's consistent efforts to protect the uninvolved population.\"",
      "But the UN and international humanitarian organisations operating in Gaza have said there's no such thing as a \"safe zone\" that is unilaterally enforced.",
      "Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said: \"We have said it so so many times. There is no safe zone in Gaza. No place is safe. No-one is safe. No place is spared.\"",

    "summary": "Could there be ways to bypass the ban - and could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop the law?",
    "story": [
      "TikTok will be banned in the US on 19 January - unless the Supreme Court accepts a last ditch legal bid from its Chinese owner, ByteDance, that to do so would be unconstitutional.",
      "But even if the country's highest judicial authority agrees with the lower courts - and Congress - that the platform is a threat to national security will that actually stop Americans using it?",
      "Will there be ways to bypass the ban - or could president-elect Donald Trump find a way to stop a law he says he opposed to, even if the courts uphold it?",
      "And whatever happens to TikTok, who stands to benefit from the uncertainty clouding its future?",
      "Can people still use TikTok even if it's banned?",
      "The most likely way the US would ban TikTok is to order app stores, such as the Google Play Store and Apple's App Store, to make it unavailable for download in that region.",
      "US lawmakers have already told  tech firms to be ready to remove the app from their stores if a ban comes into force.",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "Why does the US want to ban TikTok?",
      "Trump urges US Supreme Court to delay TikTok ban",
      "That would mean people could no longer use a legitimate means to access TikTok - though it would also mean people who've already got it would still have it on their phones.",
      "Because the app would not be publicly available anymore, new updates could no longer be delivered to users in the US - which would make the app buggier and, eventually, unusable.",
      "Not to mention that many updates are provided to fix security holes in apps, so if TikTok stopped getting updates that could present hackers with millions of devices to target.",
      "Of course, there are ways around such a ban.",
      "There are already many videos circulating on TikTok informing users how to use a VPN (virtual private network) - a way of making it appear as if you are in another region.",
      "The region of app stores can also be changed on most devices, so anyone can theoretically access apps from other countries - though this may cause other problems, not to mention likely breaking terms of service agreements.",
      "It is also possible to install apps downloaded from the internet by modifying a device - which may break copyright law - and comes with its own risks. However the government has also anticipated this so is also proposing to ban \"internet hosting services\" from giving people access to the app.",
      "So if the ban took this kind of form it seems likely that those who are determined to use TikTok after it comes into effect will be able to do so - but it won't be the experience they are used to.",
      "How else could TikTok be banned?",
      "There are still other routes available to the government down the road - for example, after India banned TikTok in 2020, it ordered internet providers to block access to the app altogether.",
      "And even if people did use a VPN, there are still ways TikTok could theoretically judge whether a person is based in the US - and then simply present them with a screen saying the app is not available in their country.",
      "It remains to be seen whether TikTok would decide to assist the government in its own ban - but it is being reported by Reuters that it plans to do so.",
      "TikTok's own lawyer told the Supreme Court that he believes the app will \"go dark\" in the US unless it rules in its favour.",
      "The complexity of the issue means even the experts are unclear about what happens next.",
      "Professor Milton L. Mueller of the Georgia Institute of Technology - who filed a legal brief in support of TikTok - said a lack of clarity around how far the US could extend its authority to enforce the law makes knowing what technically happens if a ban goes ahead difficult to determine.",
      "But he said what was clear was the impact it would have on users and the internet itself.",
      "\"It would totally legitimise the fragmentation of the internet along national or jurisdictional boundaries,\" he said.",
      "Will Trump still be able to intervene?",
      "Trump has been clear he does not want the law to come into force, asking the Supreme Court to delay its implementation while he seeks a \"political solution.\"",
      "But, should the justices uphold it, Trump does not have the power to overturn the law, which would come into effect the day before he returns to office.",
      "But he could simply tell the Department of Justice not to enforce it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google that they won't be punished for continuing to allow access to TikTok, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "Obviously, the firms might be uncomfortable about breaking the law even if they've been told it's fine - as it would be effectively requiring them to take the president's word for it that they won't face punishment.",
      "What platforms could people turn to instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million users in the US who, on average, spent 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Ban TikTok or make it less usable and that creates a huge opportunity for its big tech rivals says Jasmine Enberg, analyst at Insider Intelligence.",
      "\"Meta-owned Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts, owned by Google, are the most natural fits for displaced users, creators, and advertisers,\" she says.",
      "Facebook could benefit too, though Ms Enberg says, in common with all Meta platforms, the controversial policy changes announced by boss Mark Zuckerberg could potentially lessen its appeal.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so a ban could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief Marketing Officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok - this is the same behaviour we saw in India when they banned TikTok in 2020\", said Forrester principal analyst Kelsey Chickering.",
      "Lemon8, which is also owned by ByteDance, would have been an obvious place for people to go following a ban - but the law stipulates it also applies to other apps owned or operated by the firm. This means Lemon8 is probably also going to face being made inaccessible in the US.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name on hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though it continues to grow with other content.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have seen rapid growth in the US and the UK.",
      "Still, some suggest no existing app can truly replace TikTok, in particular its feature TikTok Shop, which lets users purchase products directly from videos, and makes a lot of money for US creators.",
      "Craig Atkinson, CEO of digital marketing agency Code3, said there was no direct competitor that people could easily switch to - and notes his agency was signing new contracts with clients to build TikTok Shop campaigns as late as December.",
      "Could a new buyer still emerge?",
      "Up until now, ByteDance has been resolute that no sale of its prize asset in the US is on the table.",
      "But could that change if it is actually banned - and when a president who prides himself on \"the art of the deal\" returns to the White House?",
      "Potential buyers continue to line up - with Bloomberg News reporting on Tuesday that the firm was looking at a sale to billionaire Elon Musk, though TikTok has since described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Trump's former treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt are among those who have previously expressed an interest in  buying it.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20 billion in verbal commitments from a consortium of investors to bid for TikTok.",
      "There is an even more leftfield - and considerably less serious - proposed owner.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world MrBeast has claimed he's now in the running to make a deal after he had billionaires reaching out to him about it.",
      "Though it may seem like a joke, he has a significant financial incentive to try and save the app - MrBeast has more than 100m followers on TikTok."

    "summary": "The group say their official witness statements were translated into Arabic by a boat company employee.",
    "story": [
      "Survivors of a deadly dive-boat sinking in the Red Sea say they were pressured to sign official witness statements in Arabic - which they couldn't understand and had been translated from English by an employee of the boat company.",
      "They say the man also tried to get them to sign waivers which stated they did not accuse anyone of \"criminal wrongdoing\".",
      "The 11 survivors who have spoken to the BBC have also accused the Egyptian authorities of trying to cover up what happened, saying investigators were determined to blame it on a huge wave.",
      "The Sea Story had been carrying 46 people when it sank in the early hours of 25 November last year - four bodies were recovered and seven people are still missing, including two British divers.",
      "Neither the Egyptian government nor the boat operators - Dive Pro Liveaboard, based in Hurghada - have responded to our questions.",
      "On Tuesday, the BBC revealed multiple accusations from survivors of safety failings on board the vessel. A leading oceanographer who analysed weather data also said it was not plausible that a huge wave had hit the vessel.",
      "'Interrogated' from hospital beds",
      "Within hours of being brought ashore, survivors say they were subjected to what one described as \"an interrogation\", some from their hospital beds, by people they were told were judges.",
      "Those who didn't need hospital treatment were interviewed at a nearby resort, said other survivors, who reported the same feelings of being pressured.",
      "\"We were told we couldn't leave the room until they'd done everybody's statements,\" says Sarah Martin, an NHS doctor from Lancashire.",
      "The judges were part of an Egyptian investigation into what caused the sinking - though survivors say it was not clear exactly who was leading it.",
      "The survivors say having their initial statements translated into Arabic by an employee of the company that owned the Sea Story was a clear conflict of interest.",
      "Spanish diver Hissora Gonzalez said the man did not initially introduce himself as an employee. \"He just said, 'You have to tell me what happened, and then you have to sign this piece of paper.'\"",
      "It was not until later, say several people we spoke to, that the man told them he worked for Dive Pro Liveaboard.",
      "The survivors say that, after being translated by the man, their statements were handed to investigators - something that shocked Lisa Wolf. \"A normal judge can't take a translation from someone that's obviously totally involved in the process.\"",
      "One survivor, who is a Norwegian police investigator, said she had \"no clue\" what the four pages of Arabic handed back to her actually said. \"They could have written anything. I don't know what I signed,\" Fr\u00f8ydis Adamson explained. Under her signature she says she wrote that she had not been able to read the documents.",
      "\"We were in such shock and just wanted to go home,\" said Hissora.",
      "'Release of liability document'",
      "Representatives of the boat operators, Dive Pro Liveaboard, also repeatedly tried to push people into signing waivers - say survivors - which would have seen them agreeing to the statement: \"I do not accuse anyone of any criminal wrongdoing.\"",
      "Justin Hodges, an American diver who was also rescued, told us the \"release of liability document\", written in English, was handed to him as he was giving his witness statement.",
      "He said he had thought the person he was talking to was \"an official\", but at this point learned that he worked for the company.",
      "\"He slid in with the authorities,\" says Justin. \"The fact he tried to get us to release liability at that moment was insane to me.\"",
      "At least some of the people we spoke to didn't sign the document.",
      "Everyone we spoke to said they had not been allowed to keep copies of their statements, but the BBC was told some people had managed to translate the documents with their phones. Many of those told us that key, damning details which they had conveyed verbally were left out of the paperwork.",
      "\"Everything about the condition of the life rafts and safety issues on the boat went away,\" says Lisa.",
      "Sarah and Hissora reported the same experience. \"They just put whatever they wanted,\" says Hissora.",
      "'The only one responsible is the sea'",
      "Survivors also say the authorities seemed determined to blame the tragedy on a huge wave from the outset.",
      "That is despite many of those rescued saying the waves were not too big to stop them swimming. A leading oceanographer has told the BBC that contemporaneous meteorological data from the nearest airport strongly supports the survivors' recollections.",
      "Hissora asked if she could eventually see a copy of the investigators' final report, but says she was told there was no need. \"[It's like] they already knew the cause was a wave,\" she says.",
      "When she asked again, Hissora said she was told \"the only one responsible for this is the sea\". She believes the authorities had already made up their minds before the investigation had even begun.",

      "\"Just because I couldn't name the person and the crime, it didn't mean someone wasn't to blame,\" says Sarah.",
      "A final attempt by Dive Pro Liveaboard to get survivors to sign waivers was made as one group tried to leave for Cairo, says Justin.",
      "Having lost their passports at sea, he says the group was told by a company representative that the documents being presented to them were clearance papers to get through checkpoints.",
      "\"But then I get to the bottom and the last sentence is the same release of liability question,\" - a repeat of the one he says he was asked to sign when he gave his witness statement.",
      "Justin says he went to alert the others and, when he returned to the man who he believed was trying to mislead him, the papers had \"magically disappeared\" and been replaced with more official-looking documents.",

      "He says their family has constantly received partial and inaccurate news from the Egyptian government.",
      "For example, after the disaster they say they were told the boat had not been found - despite the fact they saw on TV survivors from the wreck being brought ashore. They are calling for an open investigation.",
      "\"It would appear that Egyptian authorities are doing their very best to kind of sweep this under the carpet,\" says Andy. \"They want to protect their tourism industry.\"",
      "In March, a fire on another Dive Pro Liveaboard boat - the Sea Legend - killed a German tourist.",
      "Last year, Maritime Survey International, an independent consultancy, produced a report on the safety of dive boats in the Red Sea. It inspected eight vessels, although not including any operated by Dive Pro Liveaboard, and found none had \"a planned maintenance system, safety management system or stability books\", a crucial document for avoiding capsize.",
      "It also found design standards to be \"poor with all the vessels lacking watertight bulkheads, doors and hatches\".",
      "It concluded that not a single vessel was safe and the dive boat industry in Egypt \"plies its trade largely unregulated\".",
      "On 7 January, a group of 15 survivors, including many of those we spoke to, emailed Egypt's Chamber of Diving and Water Sports (CDWS), which regulates all diving activities and is linked to the Ministry of Tourism.",
      "They relayed their safety concerns and questioned why Dive Pro Liveaboard was still able to operate. The CDWS managing director replied on 9 January and said there was an ongoing investigation into the case, which was being taken \"very seriously\".",
      "He added that \"appropriate action\" would be taken \"against any negligence \u2026 that resulted in the compromise of people's safety\"."

    "summary": "Pigs, donkeys and even a mini cow named Cuddles found a temporary home after the LA fires.",
    "story": [
      "The trailers arrived all at once, carrying hundreds of horses fleeing the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles.",
      "Some horses came solo, others in trailers packed with fellow animals. Many had their owners, but others arrived alone, brought in by their rescuers or animal control. Pigs, donkeys and miniature horses followed.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Los Angeles Equestrian Center had been transformed into a modern-day Noah's Ark. Over the last week, it has sheltered hundreds of animals from the disaster as part of its official role as one of the city's large animal shelters.",
      "The facility, tucked in the shadow of Griffith Park, has taken in more than 200 horses, on top of the roughly 500 already living there.",
      "Last Tuesday and Wednesday were \"chaos\", said Jennie Nevin, a spokeswoman for the equestrian centre. The facility catalogued every horse that arrived, making sure they could be reunited. Sheltering the animals came at no cost for the owners, thanks to the support of public donations and frequent drop-offs of free hay, feed and other supplies.",
      "Sergio Marcial was one of dozens of people who brought animals here after their own facilities were destroyed or threatened.",
      "A week ago, he and his girlfriend Jenny Bacon raced to help rescue more than 70 animals from the Eaton Dam Stables while battling flames so intense that his face mask caught fire and his eyeglasses shattered and warped.",
      "His efforts landed him in the hospital, his lungs and throat burned after inhaling the torched air.",
      "One week later, Mr Marcial, 29, and Ms Bacon, 30, walked Arthur and Playboy - two miniature horses he helped save that night - around their new home. Here, they were safe from the fires, and they seemed calm and friendly despite everything they had endured.",
      "\"It still hurts to swallow,\" Mr Marcial said, pointing to a face mask he's required to wear to prevent infections. \"I'd do it all again - no question.\"",
      "Most of the sheltered animals' owners have been identified, and several owners spent Tuesday afternoon walking their horses around the stables.",
      "Dozens of volunteers cared for the other animals staying at the centre. Some had become local celebrities.",
      "Two donkeys, Morris and Mika, frequently poked their heads out of their stables to demand attention. They had fled down the mountain with their owner as the Palisades fire drew near, and were reunited because he had spray-painted his number on to their sides.",
      "\"They love for you to sing to them,\" said volunteer Lucena Herrera. \"We've all just been adopting them and taking care of them.\"",
      "But a handful of animals still have not been claimed. A miniature horse named Izzy had still not found her owner a week after the fires. The volunteers had collectively adopted her until she could find a new, permanent home.",
      "So many volunteers showed up to help the animals that the staff had to turn some away, Ms Nevin said. Between 50-100 volunteers now raked stalls, fed the animals, fluffed hay and serenaded Morris and Mika when they grew antsy.",
      "Watching owners reunite with their horses was one of the most valuable experiences for volunteers, said London Scott, founder of the local Cali Cowboy Club.",
      "\"It's a really beautiful process to go through,\" Ms Scott said, \"To be able to see that at first hand, and know that you had a small part in someone having a little peace of mind in a tragic moment in time.\"",
      "Those here describe a deep bond to their animals and say the farms that burned down are a place of peace in this bustling metropolitan area.",
      "\"They are my safe place,\" Catherine Armenta, 42, said. \"It's like a bond, a connection that I don't really have with anything else on this planet.\"",
      "Many of those here don't know what happens next, where they might take their animals after the chaos of the ongoing fires burning around the Los Angeles region ends.",
      "\"I haven't been able to even process any of this. There's 40 horses to take care of,\" Ms Bacon said. \"When everything is said and done, I think we're all gonna go get margaritas and just have a good cry.\""

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 03:43:20 GMT",
    "summary": "US President-elect Donald Trump's nominee was grilled for hours about his ability to run the defence department.",
    "story": [
      "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defence secretary in his upcoming presidency, cleared his first hurdle on the way to confirmation: a long - and at times tense - hearing before the US Senate's Armed Services Committee.",
      "For more than four hours on Tuesday, Hegseth faced questions about his ability to run the defence department, including its three million employees and $849bn (\u00a3695bn) budget.",
      "And although he was grilled by Democrats over accusations of sexual assault, infidelity and drinking in the workplace, he appears all but certain to be confirmed to the role after no Republicans came out against him.",
      "This was underscored later on Tuesday when Joni Ernst, one Republican who had been seen as a potential roadblock to his nomination, said she would support him.",
      "Here's a look at the five main takeaways from Hegseth's testimony.",
      "A 'warrior ethos'",
      "From the very start of his testimony, Hegseth, a military veteran, emphasised what he called a \"warrior culture\", vowing to return the focus of the defence department to the strength of America's military.",
      "\"Warfighting, lethality, meritocracy, standards, and readiness. That's it. That is my job,\" he said in his opening statements.",
      "As the hearing continued, Hegseth was critical of policies he felt harmed the efficiency and \"lethality\" of the military, namely efforts aimed at racial and gender diversity.",
      "\"This is not a time for equity,\" he said, adding that he opposes quotas, which he claims hurt morale.",
      "Women in the military",
      "In what became an expectedly partisan hearing, Democrats repeatedly grilled Hegseth on his past statements suggesting women were not suited to serve in combat roles in the military.",
      "Questions along these lines from Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mazie Hirono and Elizabeth Warren provided some of the most heated moments of the morning.",
      "He spoke over Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, as she tried to point to comments about female service members stretching back years.",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?The tricky questions facing Trump's recruitsWhat Trump can and can't do on day one",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "The tricky questions facing Trump's recruits",
      "What Trump can and can't do on day one",
      "\"Mr Hegseth, I'm quoting you in a podcast: 'Women shouldn't be in combat at all',\" Warren said.",
      "Hegseth remained composed, responding by saying his concern was not women in combat, but simply maintaining \"standards\" in the military.",
      "Lack of experience or 'breath of fresh air'?",
      "Hegseth, who at 44 would be the youngest defence secretary in decades, also answered questions about his preparedness to run the defence department, a sprawling agency.",
      "The former Fox News host described himself as a \"change agent\", saying \"it's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm.\"",
      "Some Republicans deemed Hegseth's lack of experience a strength.",
      "\"I just want to say for all the talk of experience and not coming from the same cocktail parties that permanent Washington is used to, you are a breath of fresh air,\" Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican from Missouri, said.",
      "A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Hegseth, also a former Fox News TV host, has military experience in Afghanistan as well.",
      "Still, Democrats pressed Hegseth on his qualifications for the top military job. Reporting from US media found that Hegseth's tenures at the helm of two non-profit veterans groups ended in financial disarray.",
      "Combat veteran Tammy Duckworth focused on whether Hegseth had ever supervised an audit.",
      "\"Senator, in both of the organisations I ran, we were always completely fiscally responsible,\" Hegseth began, before Duckworth cut in.",
      "\"Yes or no? Did you lead an audit? Do you not know this answer?\" Duckworth said.",
      "What he wasn't asked",
      "Some experts told the BBC they were most struck by how little Hegseth talked about how he'd handle the job's military complexities.",
      "Aside from brief mentions of China and the war in Ukraine and Russia, senators did not ask Hegseth specifically about current conflicts, and other potential military adversaries and strategic rivals.",
      "Those fundamental issues were mostly \"crowded out\" by the questions about  Hegseth's character and competence, said Mara Karlin, former assistant defence secretary for strategy, plans, and capabilities.",
      "\"What's astonishing about the hearing is just how little focus there has been on the bread and butter of what the secretary of defence has to do, which is protect the nation, and ensure you have a military capable of winning conflicts,\" Karlin said.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee member Tammy Duckworth was also unimpressed with what Hegseth had to say about military strategy.",
      "\"He couldn't answer some of the most basic questions I asked of him,\" the Democratic Senator from Illinois told the BBC.",
      "Duckworth said that Hegseth could not name a single country that is in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - \"basic questions that any international affairs college student would be able to answer\".",
      "\"All he did today was reaffirm to me that he's not qualified for this job,\" she said.",
      "Sexual assault or smear campaign?",
      "A 2017 accusation of sexual assault in Monterey, California, which surfaced soon after Trump tapped him for the Pentagon role, came up repeatedly.",
      "According to a police report, an unnamed woman said Hegseth took her phone and blocked the door when she tried to leave his hotel room before sexually assaulting her.",

      "Introduction",
      "The first time it hit me that I had reached \"a certain age\" was while strolling through the streets of downtown New York with my daughters. They are, if I may be so bold, stunning girls. Rowan is a strawberry blonde with curves to die for; Grier is six feet tall, all legs, and towers over me. They're also funny, fiercely intelligent, thoughtful, and kind, though I guess those traits are less obvious to the casual observer.",
      "On this particular day, we were walking side by side, me in the middle, and it was impossible not to notice the admiring looks from various passersby. Over the years I've become used to being recognized on the street, but this time was different: the looks weren't cast in my direction, but at the two beauties by my side. I had every single feeling, all at once. What are you doing ogling my babies I will cut you but also aren't they gorgeous but also, wait, no one's gazing at me? When did that happen? Am I over? Protectiveness, pride, melancholy\u2014it all smacked me upside the head in one quintessential New York minute.",
      "There was also the time I was doing a photo shoot, and after a couple shots I took a peek at the monitor. \"I think there's some dust on the camera lens,\" I said to the photographer, pointing to a weird line on my cheek. His response was something to the effect of a pitying \"Awww, you're cute.\" There was no dust. That \"something\" was a wrinkle.",
      "I didn't have my first child until I was thirty-seven. I went through a hard time after I had Rowan, suffering from postpartum depression, which I wrote about in my first book, Down Came the Rain. But with the help of good medical professionals and the right medication, I felt like myself again, more or less, by her first birthday. I had Grier when I was forty, and the ensuing decade felt, in a word, playful. That was a brand-new feeling for me. I remember thinking in my forties, This isn't old at all! This is fun! Keep in mind, I'd been treated like an adult (and was expected to behave like one) since I was a kid. At forty, it was as though my biological age finally aligned with the age I'd felt for decades. I felt mature yet still playful. I was firing on all cylinders, and at the risk of sounding like Maria von Trapp, the world seemed full of possibilities. I felt like I was being primed for a moment when I could finally pat myself on the back and say \"You've earned it!\" if I chose to take a break. Plus, I'd arrived at a place of self-acceptance. I actually liked my body and no longer compared it to the runway models. (I never did runway and believed those girls were \"skinny,\" whereas I was considered \"athletic\"\u2014in my modeling days, a euphemism for \"not skinny.\") At forty, relieving myself of being compared to others felt like freedom. Mine was a body to be proud of. This body gave me babies! This body could dance! I had curves and was okay with that! It wasn't exactly \"I am woman, hear me roar,\" but I certainly felt like, \"I am woman, hear me more.\"",
      "And yet, as my forties progressed into my fifties, I began to notice that external perceptions didn't seem to match up with my internal sense of self. My industry no longer received me with the same enthusiasm I had come to expect. The vibe from casting agents and producers, but also my fans, was more: you need to stop time ... and maybe even reverse it. Case in point: at a routine dermatological appointment (to get a mole checked out), the doctor, unsolicited, waved his hand around my face and said, \"We could fix all that ...\"",
      "\"All what?\" I asked.",
      "\"You know, all the\"\u2014cue more hand waving\u2014\"you know.\"",
      "What the hell? Who asked for your opinion? I thought as I heard myself say, \"Thank you, but not yet.\"",
      "Maybe it took seeing myself through the eyes of other people to fully understand that, in fact, I was entering a new era of life. I mean, I was aware that some things were changing. I get tired now in a way I never did before. I literally can't read the fine print, and I hate it. I used to get mad at my mom for always misplacing her reading glasses, and now it's me saying \"Grier, honey, have you seen my readers?\" I like doing needlepoint and puzzles, which admittedly feels a bit geriatric. Am I in my mahjongg era?? I need 2.5s for these granny activities!",
      "And yes, sometimes I put on a pair of pants that once fit, and think, God, this used to be so much easier. Or I watch my kids, who can sleep until noon without stirring at the garbage trucks or sirens outside, and think, Ah, youth. There was a time when I could go to bed without taking a pill or being up for hours in the middle of the night, what was that like? And though these shockingly beautiful young women spend hours in front of the very mirrors I try to avoid, they still don't realize how fresh and perky and unaffected by gravity their bodies are\u2014just like we didn't at their age. (I mean, the butt and the boobs! How did I not appreciate that when I had it?) They complain that they hate their legs, whereas my knees are now practically lower than my calves. How is that even a thing? We are always chasing, never appreciating, and what runs through my mind is, Ugh, where is the justice?? Why are we forever criticizing ourselves and our bodies while seeking ridiculous perfection? Why do we never see how unique and special we are? And why, when we finally take the pressure off or count our blessings or just enjoy who we are, is it practically too late?",
      "But while I don't feel as invincible as I did in my youth, I also don't feel fifty-nine. When I was a kid, fifty-nine seemed so OLD, but it sure doesn't feel old to me now! When I say my age out loud, I know it may sound old to some people, but I truly don't feel, in any way, aged. Aging is a journey full of contradictions, especially in America. It's humbling and surprising and empowering and daunting and liberating. In plenty of cultures, older people are revered. In Korea, the sixtieth and seventieth birthdays are considered major life events, marked by parties and feasts. In Native American communities, elders are often referred to as \"wisdom-keepers\"\u2014they're considered community leaders. In India, elders have the final word in family disputes. In the Henchy-Shields household, on the other hand, this elder is constantly told, \"Mom, you just don't get it!\"",
      "In fact, a March 2023 cover story of the American Psychological Association's Monitor on Psychology described ageism in America as \"one of the last socially acceptable prejudices.\" Brands trip over themselves to capture the coveted eighteen-to-thirty-four demographic, even though surveys have found it's women over forty who have the most purchasing power: we have accumulated wealth, and we're making 85 percent of the household-buying decisions. The numbers for women over fifty are even more staggering: We control a net worth of $19 trillion, and spend 2.5 times that of the average person. Women in their forties and fifties are treated like we're invisible, even though we're one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. (One in four Americans is a woman over forty.) We are ignored by brands, and when we are targeted, it's for wrinkle cream or menopause supplements. Talk about shortsighted.",
      "This notion of invisibility is so widespread, so pervasive, that it has become the namesake of a social phenomenon, aptly dubbed \"invisible woman syndrome.\" The gist? When we are no longer deemed sexy or able to contribute to society by birthing and raising young children, our value diminishes. We are overlooked, ignored, or worse, not seen at all.",
      "And the older we get, the more extreme it gets. An analysis of nearly eleven thousand ads featuring over twenty thousand people in 2021 and 2022 found that those featuring women over sixty years old amounted to a whopping 0.93 percent of all advertisements. You read that right: less than one percent of all advertisements feature women over sixty, even though the 2020 census found that one in six people in America is over sixty-five.",
      "According to a survey of women over forty by the advertising agency Fancy (which is specifically focused on marketing to a female audience), most women over forty feel that brands \"underestimate their spending power and intelligence while overestimating their preoccupation with appearance.\" We are, it turns out, more than just a demographic obsessed with looking younger. We embody vitality. We are smart and vibrant and powerful and ambitious. We are experienced, confident, capable, and complicated. We are running s**t.",
      "The truth is, I still can't quite get over that I'm using words like \"aging\" and \"elder\" in the same breath as I talk about myself and my friends. I'm not even sixty! I may not be playing the ing\u00e9nue or the girl next door or even the first love, but I'm not exactly the grandmother in Titanic.",
      "And yet, no one knows what to do with me. After all, Brooke Shields is not allowed to get old. The sixteen-year-old Calvin Klein model? Time magazine's face of the '80s? It's sacrilegious! I remember seeing a picture of what Marilyn Monroe would look like if she were still alive today, and it was truly impossible to wrap my head around. But she died looking like Marilyn Monroe. For me, as my body and face change in all the ways they should (don't get me started on my thinning, graying eyebrows), there is this sense of How dare you? That was never the plan, young lady! And, to be totally honest, there have been times when it's made me feel like a disappointment. Maybe you've felt this way, too\u2014maybe you were an athlete in your youth, singled out for your form and speed, and now you can still swim or run or play tennis or whatever, but not at the same level. You're still strong, but you had the audacity to grow older, to change, to slow down a bit, to not die young or stop aging entirely. You survived, and it should be celebrated, and yet there's a sense that you're not as valuable or exceptional as you once were, and therefore you're letting people down. And these reactions can cause us to feel disappointed in ourselves, too. I look back sometimes and feel like I've done something wrong because I no longer have the body or the face that I used to have. And yet, if I did anything drastic to hold on to my looks from my youth or to stop aging, I'd be judged or chastised for that, too.",
      "Generally speaking, at fifty-nine, I feel more confident than I ever have. I'm more comfortable in my skin and have stopped comparing myself to this ideal or worrying about that expectation. But I'll admit that even as I'm experiencing this newfound sense of satisfaction, I have to remind myself, sometimes daily, that I am good enough. The old negative tapes are lying in wait in the Walkman (remember those!?), ready for me to press play at any moment. But I also realize that if I don't wear makeup or the \"right-sized jeans and someone has a problem with it, that's on them. And yes, I continue to exercise and take care of my skin, but I think of it now as a privilege, because it makes me feel better. Do I sometimes wish that all my bits had remained higher and perkier? Or that I had the same skin that appeared on the cover of Life magazine in 1983? Of course I do! Who doesn't miss the gifts of youth? But this is a body\u2014and soul\u2014that has carried me through a lot, and I'm not ashamed to admit that I think I deserve some credit for this life well lived. We do all this work and get through hard times and suddenly you have a line on your face, and that one little wrinkle carries more weight than decades of accomplishments.",
      "I'll tell you, it took me a long time to have the guts to say that I deserved a bit more respect. Something began to shift in me around age forty. I started to own myself and my narrative in a new way. I'm not sure what it was that finally clicked, though becoming a mother probably had something to do with it. What I do know is that gaining that deeper sense of identity allowed me to speak up when others tried to diminish me. It's allowed me to look within and identify patterns and break cycles. It's allowed me to take on new risks and challenges. I know who I am and what I have to offer, and I've stopped hoping or trying to be different, or something that I'm not.",
      "Of course, as proud as I am of how far I've come ... there is still so much that I want to do. I want to pile into a camper with my daughters and my husband and take a cross-country road trip (although we'd probably end up killing each other, and the romance of the Porta Potti would surely wear off quickly). I want to learn to play an instrument. I want to get back to being fluent in French (it was my college major, after all). I want to travel to places I haven't been. The list goes on.",
      "All of this is doable, because there's a lot of freedom that comes with age. It's more fun to take a dance class when you can truly let yourself dance like no one is watching. It's more fun to go out with friends when you aren't worrying if you said the wrong thing or if people are talking about you behind your back. It's more fun to go to a restaurant alone when you realize that no one is wondering why you don't have a companion ... that no one is looking at you at all, because they're all dealing with their own s**t. And while, yes, my body is a little creakier than it once was, and it's not as easy to lose weight, the truth is I can still do almost everything I used to do. And the things I can't, well, I don't really want to. I don't want to surf ... I don't want to ski, unless it's somewhere sunny and the trail is long and relatively flat\u2014I just don't feel like exposing myself to freezing temperatures, fighting scary moguls, and navigating with the gear. But I don't feel limited. I'm happy that, at least for me, the moment for more intense, competitive activities has passed, and the moment for new emotional beginnings has arrived. I don't have to prove myself anymore. This is it. This is me! And if there is something I want to change, then I can make the decision to do so.",
      "What I've come to realize\u2014not only from my own lived experience but also from conversations with other women my age\u2014is that these \"later\" years are all about coming into your own and pivoting in the directions you've always wanted to go. You can finally live the life you intended to, because you no longer have to act in accordance with external timelines, something that is part and parcel of being a woman. I don't have to get married by this date or have kids by this age or get a certain job before that milestone. My time is my own.",
      "And yet\u2014 this newfound gift has come as a bit of a surprise. After all, the narrative we've been served for years is that it's all downhill for women after a certain age. As I hit my midfifties, I grew increasingly curious about the disconnect between how this age feels and how it's portrayed in our culture and society. I talked to other women my age who felt the same tension I did\u2014 both personally empowered and systemically dismissed. And this idea of being collectively ignored ... it irked me. I started connecting even more with women over forty, online and on social media, because I wanted to dig into what makes aging hard and what makes it great. What began as an online community to discuss health, aging, sexuality, relationships, and just plain living\u2014to dish about all those things you can't say to anyone except your closest girlfriends\u2014evolved into a hair-care brand, Commence, and a new business. So here I am, a first-time CEO in my fifties, inspired to start a business\u2014and write a book!\u2014all because of society's most uninspiring take on women my age.",
      "My first two memoirs, Down Came the Rain and There Was a Little Girl, were at their core about overcoming obstacles: first, postpartum depression, and second, losing my mom. But there is nothing to \"overcome\" about aging. That's the whole point! This time of our lives is something to enjoy and revel in, not something to merely survive. So if those books were about how I persevered through tough moments, this one is about how I took ownership and agency of a moment I'd been told would be tough, but really is rich and complex. But come on, life is complex. This book is about embracing an era that has been billed as an obstacle when, in reality, it's a stimulus. Yes, it has new and difficult challenges, but it doesn't have to be viewed as torture or a time to throw in the towel. I'm not trying to stave off this period, or deny it, or pretend I'm not in it. I'm taking the whole mess of it and reminding myself, and hopefully other women, that we have the elements we need to thrive. The story we've been told is, in a word, bulls**t. We are the narrators of our next chapters.",
      "For too long, women have talked about aging only in whispers and behind closed doors. Maybe it's because we've been embarrassed or ashamed. Maybe it's because we don't think anyone would want to hear what we have to say. These are understandable responses to our treatment by society, but they only serve to keep us isolated and disempowered. Recently, I had the pleasure of attending an intimate \"couch conversation\" with Gloria Steinem where she was talking about the challenges of being a woman today. The younger women in the room were eagerly asking her, \"But how can we fix it? How can we be a force for change?\" And she reminded us that \"every important movement started in a room like this\u2014in a basement, or a living room.\" When we step out from behind those closed doors and use our voices to talk about the misunderstandings, the underestimations, we're already starting to change them. Maybe even fix them.",
      "As far as I can tell, these decades in our lives are a time to be celebrated. Sure, there will be some hot flashes (been there!), but we can wear layers. (Or take hormones, which I have done, but more on that later.) I can tell you that the discomfort of those moments is far outweighed by the delight that comes from making intentional friendships, pursuing new interests, discovering our peak confidence, and giving ourselves permission to make changes to our lives.",
      "In 2023, my dear friend Ali Wentworth produced a documentary, Pretty Baby, about my life. Watching it, and seeing just how much I've been through, I couldn't help but feel proud. I'm not saying everyone should make a documentary about their lives, but I hope you can look back at how far you've come, how much life you've lived in order to get to this moment, and give yourself credit for the feat that it is. And then I hope it gives you the jump start you need to figure out how to enjoy this new stage of your life. Because the time is now! If there is something you want to change, now's the time to change it. If there's something you want to stop, now's the time to stop it. If there's something you want to do, now's the time to do it.",
      "Being relegated to the sidelines, as misguided as it is, also offers us more room to fully be ourselves. There's less pressure. We can push boundaries when we're moving through the world without the watchful eyes of, well, everyone. In Why We Can't Sleep: Women's New Midlife Crisis, author Ada Calhoun reconsiders all the so-called negatives of getting older. \"Could we see ... our newfound midlife invisibility as a source of power?\" she writes. \"There are great advantages to being underestimated. Two of the best reporters I know are women in their fifties. They look so friendly and nonthreatening, if you notice them at all. They can lurk in any room without usually wary people remembering to keep their guard up. Then they write devastating whistle-blowing articles. The world ignores middle-aged women at its peril.\"",
      "At fifty-nine, I'm the one making the calls in my life\u2014not my mother or the media or Hollywood or my family\u2014which is something I've never felt before. And this should be true for all of us. It doesn't matter what you've done, or what you think you've done (good or bad), or even what you always wanted to do. This is a new time. The same rules don't apply. Is that disorienting? Maybe, but I like to give it a different spin: We can make our own rules.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 10:08:10 -0500",
    "summary": "Now nearly 60, the model and actress was recently elected president of Actors' Equity, and launched Commence, her beauty brand for women over 40. She's also written her fourth book, \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old,\"",
    "story": [
      "Last Sunday, Demi Moore accepted her first major acting award at the Golden Globes. Watching from home was Brooke Shields \"My kids'll be like, 'Oh, it's Golden Globe night. Get the bottle of wine for Mom! Get the tequila!'\" Shields laughed. \"It's so interesting, these award shows, right? They can be torturous if you sit there and you go like, Why am I not valid enough to get that, do that, whatever?\"",
      "I asked, \"You've felt that?\"",
      "\"I've felt it my entire life.\"",
      "It can be surprising to hear that a veteran actress like Shields yearns for acceptance. Turns out she's totally human. \"I was listening to Demi, 'We've weren't the ones that ever got awards.' Like, no. I got People's Choice Awards! The people loved me.\"",
      "\"So, you get the People's Choice Award, but you wanted the Emmy, the Oscar?\"",
      "\"You just wanted, like, to be part of the group, the cool kids,\" said Shields. \"That's where the little insecure girl comes out.\"",
      "At this point in her career of six decades, the comedienne has earned the right to laugh at herself.",
      "Currently 59, Shields said she feels 38. \"I definitely feel a youthfulness that I didn't feel in my younger years,\" she said.",
      "She started modeling while wearing diapers. Later, she turned heads wearing Calvin Klein jeans. Shields was expected to sell products and say her lines, all while looking gorgeous. She delivered.",
      "But as she approaches 60, she's found a cultural script she's powerfully rejecting.",
      "\"By the time you get to 50, they've just completely written you off,\" she said. \"You are out to pasture. Society says, 'Oh, if you're not the hot twenty-something at the bar, you're an old lady.' There's this whole demo in the middle that gets just overlooked.\"",
      "It's those overlooked women for whom Shields has written her fourth book: \"Brooke Shields Is Not Allowed to Get Old\" (to be published Tuesday by Flatiron). \"When you are someone that has been noted for looking a certain way, by virtue of just growing older, you become a disappointment, in a way,\" she said. \"I've watched people get sort of personally affronted that I dare to be 60!\"",
      "\"And what do you say to them?\"",
      "\"I just sort of feel bad for them,\" Shields said. \"And I'm a part of the problem, because I was that symbol, you know, maybe unwittingly. But I didn't set out to do that.\"",
      "Nearly 44 years after being named the face of a decade, Shields hopes to be a voice for her generation \u2013 empowering women by sharing her personal and at times vulnerable experiences.",
      "In her book, she reveals that a doctor performed a surgery on her that she did not consent to. \"I was asked by my gynecologist if I experienced discomfort, and I said yes.\"",
      "In the late 2000s, Shields went to a surgeon to help reduce some labia discomfort. But after the operation, she says she found out he performed an extra procedure: an unwanted vaginal rejuvenation. \"He literally looked at me and said, like, 'I tightened you up a bit,'\" Shields said. \"And I was like, 'What?' And he just sort of was, like, boasting that he 'threw in a little bonus' for me. And I was in such shock that I just, I became numb. I didn't even know what to do.\"",
      "\"What did you say?\"",
      "\"I didn't say it, I didn't say a thing. because it sounded like he wanted me to thank him,\" Shields replied. \"I didn't say anything then, and this is the first time I've said anything.\"",
      "That so-called bonus surgery has had lasting side effects. The actress and model says sex can be painful.",
      "\"This was, you know, a long time ago. We didn't know what we could fight or complain. I finally had a life and kids, and it was like, 'Dear God, I don't want that kind of attention,'\" she said.",
      "So, why is she speaking out now? \"Because I have daughters. And there's no shame around it. And the more we have those conversations with them, conversations that I never had, the more progress I think we will have as women.\"",
      "Shields is looking to make progress in other ways, too. In May, she was elected president of Actors' Equity Association, the union representing 51,000 actors and stage managers around the country. As a five-time Broadway star, she felt a responsibility to give back to a community that's embraced her.",
      "She's already taken her fight to Washington for more funding and to change tax policy. \u00a0\"It's been a learning curve,\" she said. \"It's trial by fire. I'd never gone on the Hill and met with Congressmen and Senators. But you know, producers need to take care of the people that bleed for them on a daily basis.\"",
      "Besides being a union boss, Shields is now a CEO. She'd founded the beauty brand Commence, after hearing concerns from aging women about their hair. \"They have felt overlooked, and that's just the truth,\" she said. \"They're not being marketed to.\"",
      "Asked what the hardest part of being a CEO is, Shields replied, \"Money raising. Keeping the money flowing, because you have to put it right back into the company. And you know, nobody's getting salaries yet. Least I'm not!\" she laughed.",
      "Don't ask Brooke Shields if she's ready to slow down. Age has brought wisdom, and she's just getting started.",
      "\"I'm, you know, going to be 60 years old,\" she said. \"I'm still here. I feel like I'm at the beginning of a new, really exciting stage. The more confident you get \u2013 isn't it interesting \u2013 the more opportunity you get. And yet, you couldn't have arrived at said confidence without going through all the time to get here.\"",

    "title": "Wendell Pierce: An actor's journey",
    "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2025 09:40:16 -0500",
    "summary": "With standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Death of a Salesman,\" and the CBS drama \"Elsbeth,\" the acclaimed actor talks about his childhood in New Orleans, training at New York's Juilliard School, and tackling the character of Willy Loman.",
    "story": [
      "It's been a few years since Wendell Pierce attended a drama class at the Juilliard School in Manhattan. Forty years, to be exact. \"I remember it well. High windows and gray floors!\" he laughed.",
      "He's said that nothing in his career gave him as much anxiety as training at Juilliard: \"Yes, the anxiety of, you know, am I doing the right thing? I'm going into an unknown world. Will I have what it takes to be just a working actor? And so, I was reminded looking in that class, it was very touching to see these young people at a point in the journey that I recall with fondness \u2013 and with a lot of anxiety, too! But I knew I was exactly where I wanted to be.\"",
      "And it's where he belongs. At 61, Pierce is among the most prolific and respected actors of his generation, with standout roles in \"The Wire,\" \"Treme,\" \"Suits,\" \"Selma,\" and now, the quirky CBS drama, \"Elsbeth.\" Later this year, he'll play editor-in-chief Perry White in the newest Superman movie. He'll also take on Othello at the Shakespeare Theater Company in Washington, D.C.",
      "No matter the part, Pierce brings his own humanity to it. He said, \"In every role, there's a little part of Wendell in it. At the end of the run, I turn the lights down low in the dressing room and I just see the silhouette in the mirror. And I have a good cry and say goodbye. Right? I say, 'Man, you taught me so much about myself. I've learned so much from you. I hope I see you again. And I know there'll be times where I will see you again.'\"",
      "That sense of self-discovery began in his hometown of New Orleans, and the historical Black neighborhood of Pontchatrain Park. \"It was like a Black Mayberry,\" he said. \"The first Black mayor came out of there, the first Black DA. Lawyers, doctors, postal workers, maintenance men. That was the community I grew up in. It was absolutely wonderful. And it was totally destroyed. We were destroyed by Katrina. We were part of the deepest flooding. And we brought it back, and now we're on the National Register of Historic Places.\"",
      "His mother, Althea, was a beloved schoolteacher. \"She taught everybody in the neighborhood. And I just remember how, everywhere I went, I knew that I had to live up to being her son,\" Pierce said.",
      "His father, Amos Pierce, Jr., was a World War II veteran. \"He was Army unit attached to the 3rd Marines in the invasion of Saipan. And after that, his unit received medals of commendation. And because he was there with the Black unit, the officer didn't believe him when he told him. He said, 'Listen, I think we received medals.' And it was a woman who said, 'Yeah, right. You? You didn't receive anything.'\"",
      "It would take 65 years for the injustice to be corrected. \"We gave him his medals on Veteran's Day 2010,\" Pierce said. \"I tell that story to say that he was a man who loved this country even when the country didn't love him back. And even after receiving the medals, there was a great pride. He didn't let the anger destroy him. And that was a great lesson.\"",
      "Pierce sees his own life as a series of lessons \u2013 and acting is part of that journey. He said, \"Every audition for me is an opening and closing night, where you get to perform: This is what I would do with this material. You do whatever you like from this point on. And then you leave the room.\"",
      "And he says his best work \u2013 be it as Detective Bunk Moreland on \"The Wire,\" or in Spike Lee's \"Malcolm X,\" comes from the writing. He said, \"The really good material is the thing that will define it, you know, and make it classic. Something that speaks to people across time and place no matter where you are, that's gonna speak to people years from now.\"",
      "A career highlight was in 2022, when Pierce became the first Black actor to play Willy Loman on Broadway, in Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman.\"",
      "Why does he think it took so long? \"The ignorance of biases and bigotry, and when people just don't have the ability to see others' humanity,\" Pierce said. \"And it's something that people are very conscious of at times, and then sometimes they're not very conscious of it.\"",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "Actor Wendell Pierce discusses historic role in Broadway's \"Death of a Salesman\" (\"CBS Saturday Morning\")",
      "And it's Pierce's own compassion that draws people towards him, like Carrie Preston, his co-star on \"Elsbeth.\" She said, \"This kind of connection isn't always guaranteed. We've got it here. I'm grateful for it.\"",
      "And it's what his fellow Juilliard classmate Bradley Whitford recalled when he surprised Pierce with a message during our interview: \"Wendell, I miss you. I love you. I am so proud of you, not only for the great actor that you are and the dear friend, but what an amazing citizen you are. I love you!\"",
      "\"That's very special,\" said Pierce. \"Brad and I, we're part of a very special group here at Juilliard, our class. You know, when you go through the fire together, you're connected forever.\"",
      "Pierce has said he wants to make his mark. I asked, \"Do you think that you have? And what is that mark? What do you want to leave for people?\"",
      "\"I was afraid that I may not have the opportunity to leave my mark, that my best days were behind me,\" he replied. \"I had that fear, and I tapped into that fear when I did 'Death of a Salesman.' And while I still have the fear, now I have courage.",
      "\"I hope I can have an impact on someone else that way, the way they have an impact on me.\"",

    "summary": "Sam Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
    "story": [
      "Sam Moore, the surviving half and higher voice of the 1960s duo Sam & Dave that was known for such definitive hits of the era as \"Soul Man\" and \"Hold On, I'm Comin,'\" has died. He was 89.",
      "Publicist Jeremy Westby said Moore died Friday morning in Coral Gables, Florida, due to complications while recovering from surgery. No additional details were immediately available.",
      "Moore, who influenced musicians including Michael Jackson, Al Green and Bruce Springsteen, was inducted with Dave Prater into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.",
      "At the Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, Moore and Prater were second only to Otis Redding. They transformed the \"call and response\" of gospel music into a frenzied stage show and recorded some of soul music's most enduring hits, which also included \"You Don't Know Like I Know,\" \"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\" and \"I Thank You.\"",
      "Most of their hits were written and produced by the team of Isaac Hayes and David Porter and featured the Stax house band Booker T. & the MGs, whose guitarist Steve Cropper received one of music's most famous shoutouts when Sam & Dave called \"Play it, Steve\" midway through \"Soul Man.\"",
      "Like many '60s soul acts, Sam & Dave faded after the 1960s. But \"Soul Man\" hit the charts again in the late 1970s when the Blues Brothers, John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd recorded it with many of the same musicians. Moore had mixed feelings about the hit becoming associated with the \"Saturday Night Live\" stars, remembering how young people believed it originated with the Blues Brothers.",
      "In 2008, the movie \"Soul Men\" depicted a pair of aging, estranged singers who bore more than a little resemblance to Sam & Dave. Moore lost a lawsuit claiming the resemblance was too close.",
      "He also spent years suing Prater after Prater hired a substitute and toured as the New Sam & Dave. Prater died in a 1988 car crash in Georgia.",
      "Moore also pressed legal claims that the record industry had cheated him out of retirement benefits. Moore and other artists sued multiple record companies and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists in 1993.",
      "Moore told The Associated Press in 1994 that he joined the legal effort after learning that, despite his million-selling records, his pension amounted to just $2,285, which he could take as a lump sum or in payments of $73 monthly.",
      "\"Two thousand dollars for my lifetime?\" Moore said then. \"If you're making a profit off of me, give me some too. Don't give me cornbread and tell me it's biscuits.\"",
      "Moore wrote the song \"Dole Man,\" modeled on \"Soul Man,\" for Republican Bob Dole's presidential campaign in 1996. In 2017, he was among the few entertainers who performed for Republican President Donald Trump's inaugural festivities. Eight years earlier, Moore had objected when Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama's campaign used the song \"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\"",
      "Moore was born Oct. 12, 1935, in Miami and got his start singing in church.",
      "He and Prater performed in soul and R&B clubs in the 1950s but didn't meet until 1961 in Miami. Moore helped coach Prater on the lyrics of a song and they quickly became a popular local duo. In 1965, after signing with Atlantic Records, producer Jerry Wexler sent them to the label's Stax subsidiary in Memphis.",
      "Moore and Prater argued often and Moore told the AP in 2006 that a drug habit, which he kicked in 1981, played a part in the band's troubles and later made entertainment executives leery of giving him a fresh start. The duo broke up in 1970 and neither had another major hit.",
      "He married his wife, Joyce, in 1982, and she helped him get treatment for his addiction which he credited with saving his life.",
      "\"I did a lot of cruise ships, I did a lot of oldies shows,\" during those struggles, he said, adding that he once opened for a group of Elvis impersonators.",
      "\"That's funny to think back to it now. And I did a lot of shows where if I did a show with an oldie show, I had to actually audition,\" he said. \"But you know what? You keep your mouth shut and you get up there and you sing as hard and perform as hard as you can, and get the little money and go on about your business and try and pay those bills. I'm laughing about it now, but at that time, man, it was really serious.\"",
      "Moore kept recording and singing. He was a frequent performer at the Kennedy Center Honors and performed for presidents, including Obama.",

    "summary": "Formulas marketed for toddlers are a burgeoning business, but pediatricians have long recommended against their use.",
    "story": [
      "A year after the American Academy of Pediatrics flagged what it described as \"questionable marketing practices\" by makers of formulas for older infants and toddlers, Abbott Laboratories is being sued over how it pitches such products.",
      "Abbott, a health care products conglomerate based in Illinois, is misleading parents and other caregivers about the nutritional value of its sugar-laden toddler milks, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Public Health Advocacy Institute (PHAI) against the maker of Similac formulas.",
      "Marketed for consumption by children ages 12 to 36 months, toddler milk is portrayed as the next step for little ones after they have outgrown infant formulas approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Yet unlike baby formula, the toddler milk products are not regulated by the FDA and are potentially harmful, according to\u00a0PHAI, a nonprofit legal research center located at Northeastern University School of Law.",
      "Sales of toddler milk nationwide have averaged more than $500 million a year, according to PHAI's suit, filed in U.S. district court for the Northern District of Illinois.",
      "\"More than just unnecessary, toddler milk products can actually be harmful to a child's nutritional health,\" said George Fuchs, a medical doctor and professor of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine Department of Pediatrics. \"The added sugars can increase a toddler's preference for sweetened foods, contributing to obesity and other health risks throughout their lives,\" noted Fuchs, who led the AAP report on toddler milks.",
      "Labeled similarly to FDA-regulated infant formulas and sold on the same store shelves, Abbott's \"Go & Grow Toddler Drink by Similac\" and \"Pure Bliss Toddler Drink by Similac\" are labeled \"Stage 3,\" implying they are the next nutritionally recommended product after \"Stage 1\" infant formula and \"Stage 2\" transitional formula, the suit alleges.",

    "summary": "It will be up to the returning Trump administration to decide whether to finalize the rule.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024. Zeller said he delivered the plan in one of his last acts before retiring, and was not sure why the Biden administration failed to finalize the rule.",
      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerns over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

    "story": [
      "Consuming more than one drink a day results in a steep increase of the risk of premature death, a new federal review has concluded. The draft report was published Tuesday ahead of a major update to influential federal guidelines on how much alcohol Americans should drink.",
      "\"In the United States, males and females have a 1 in 1000 risk of dying from alcohol use if they consume more than 7 drinks per week. This risk increases to 1 in 100 if they consume more than 9 drinks per week,\" the report's authors concluded, in a final draft published by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The review is one of two written by committees of outside experts to inform this year's update to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The other was published last month by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",
      "The upcoming guidelines are important because the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies often rely on the recommendations to justify new rules, like on how to label food and drinks. Men are currently recommended to limit intake to no more than two drinks per day and women are recommended to limit to one drink per day.",
      "\"Once you're over a drink a day, your risk of dying from alcohol is already above one percent. Some people may think that doesn't sound like a lot, but in terms of a public health guideline, that would be really, really high,\" said Dr. Timothy Naimi, director of the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and one of the authors of the report.",
      "Naimi was careful to say that the report was \"not endorsing any level of risk\" caused by drinking, but pointed to other countries and health regulations that have used 1 in 100 and 1 in 1,000 death risks as thresholds to set rules.",
      "It is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will incorporate the findings of the latest report into any updated guidelines. In 2020, the Trump administration rejected a call by its outside expert panel to recommend limiting drinking for all Americans to no more than once per day, saying the \"emerging evidence\" did not support the move.",
      "The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade coalition that represents spirits producers, called in a statement co-signed by other industry groups on the federal government to reject the findings of the panel.",
      "\"Today's report is the product of a flawed, opaque and unprecedented process, rife with bias and conflicts of interest,\" the statement said,\" accusing some of the experts on the federal panel of having ties to international anti-alcohol advocacy organizations.",
      "\"Congress never authorized or appropriated money for the panel or its work, and numerous letters from Congress and industry have voiced serious concerns over the process,\" the statement said.",
      "Alcohol linked to deaths from cancer, injuries, other causes",
      "The report was designed to weigh all of the data on a range of diseases and injuries, and boiled down a complex web of studies that have looked at alcohol's health risks and benefits into \"alcohol-attributable death\" estimates.",
      "This modeling is likely underestimating the true health risks of alcohol, Naimi said, given limits in how researchers can study its health impacts.",
      "Risks can also vary widely from person to person, the report cautions, meaning some harms can be very small for some even if they add up to substantial risks at the public health level.",
      "\"The overall effect of alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality is dependent upon the risk of diseases and injuries that are causally related to alcohol. These risks are affected by numerous factors, including smoking, diet, physical activity, obesity, hepatitis infection, and genetics,\" the report states.",
      "At one drink a day, the report estimated that injuries and cancer added up to the biggest contributors of the risk for a premature death.",
      "For men, injuries made up a substantial portion of the risk of dying. This includes a variety of accidents, road injuries and intentional harm, like suicide and violence linked to drinking.",
      "Cancer, which was next largest factor, made up a third of the additional risk of death for men.",
      "For women consuming one drink a day, the risk of death from cancer was statistically similar or larger compared to the increased risk of fatal injuries.",
      "Increased risk of a number of cancers \u2014 colorectal, female breast cancer, and cancers of the liver, mouth, throat and esophagus \u2014 \"begins with any alcohol use and increases with higher levels of use,\" the report states.",

      "One risk that was lower in people drinking once per day, compared with never drinking, was for ischemic stroke. But that apparent benefit virtually disappears at two drinks per day.",

    "summary": "It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to finalize the rule on food labels.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration released on Tuesday its long-awaited proposal to require food manufacturers to put some nutrition facts on the front of packages, in a bid to nudge Americans and food companies towards healthier diets in line with similar pushes in other countries.",
      "FDA's new \"nutrition info box\" focuses on telling people whether levels of saturated fat, sodium and added sugar are \"high\" or \"medium\" or \"low\" as well as the percentage for each serving.",
      "The proposal will be open for public comment for 120 days. It will be up to the incoming Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize the rule.",
      "After that, the FDA says that large food companies earning more than $10 million annually will have three years to comply with the rule. Smaller food brands will have an additional year.",
      "Up to $154 million will be spent by the food industry over the next decade to relabel their products with the new box, the FDA estimates.",
      "The agency also estimates many food brands may also spend millions more dollars to try to rework their products, changing their recipes to avoid being called out as having too much of an unhealthy nutrient.",
      "\"We assume there may be manufacturers who would want to reformulate to maybe move from the high category into the medium category, or the medium category into the low category,\" Rebecca Buckner, the associate deputy director for human food policy at the FDA, told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Trump's pick to head the federal department that oversees the FDA, has been sharply critical of federal nutrition officials for not doing enough to help Americans eat healthier diets and crack down on the food industry.",
      "Kennedy has not specifically addressed the proposal. A spokesperson for Kennedy did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Why only saturated fat, sodium and added sugars?",
      "The FDA said it will require the box to only call out saturated fat, sodium and added sugars. Food manufacturers would not be able to put other nutrients inside the FDA's information box.",
      "They cited research showing that \"simpler schemes are easier for consumers to understand\" for narrowing the box down to just these three worrying unhealthy nutrients.",
      "Designs they tested with focus groups that included nutrients Americans need more of, like fiber and calcium, confused participants.",
      "The FDA said it is still weighing whether calories should be incorporated into the label and acknowledged that some food brands are already voluntarily listing the information on the front.",
      "What determines \"high,\" \"medium\" and \"low\" levels?",
      "FDA officials said Tuesday that levels of saturated fat, sodium or added sugars will be deemed as \"high\" if they are above 20% in the daily value, a measurement of how much Americans eat each day in the \"reference\" diet. Medium was set at between 6% and 19% of the daily value. And low is 5% and below.",
      "Agency officials have used these benchmarks for \"high\" and \"low\" for decades, dating back to the formulation of the nutrition facts label back in the 1990s.",
      "At the time, officials decided against including the \"interpretive descriptions\" in the nutrition facts label. But the agency said recent data shows many Americans do not understand the percentages.",
      "\"It's really based on longstanding usage,\" McKinnon said.",
      "What will it look like?",
      "The FDA says food makers will be required to put the labels \"somewhere in the top third\" of the front of the box.",
      "The box also uses the same Helvetica font used in the nutrition facts on the back of the package and must comply with a range of more detailed rules to avoid it from being too small or obscured by other designs on the package.",
      "Some other design decisions were also abandoned during the focus group testing process, the FDA said.",
      "For example, previous mockups using the colors red, yellow and green to call out different levels did not make a statistically significant difference in helping people interpret the box.",

      "That is more than double the 13.52% of tests coming back positive reached during the peak of last season's wave in March, according to data from public health laboratories around the country tallied by the CDC.",
      "Labs usually test samples of sick people's stool for the virus, which can be diagnosed up to 10 days after symptoms begin. The virus can also be found in other samples, including contaminated food or drinks that can spread the virus.",
      "Rates of norovirus in that CDC system have reached levels at or above last season's peak in all regions of the country. Norovirus test positivity rates look to be the worst in the Midwest, in a grouping of states spanning Kansas through Michigan.",
      "Since most people sick with norovirus get better without needing to go to the doctor, a majority of cases go unreported in the U.S. Instead, health authorities and experts use other measurements, such as the rate of positive tests, to track trends of the virus.",
      "Data from WastewaterSCAN's sewer sampling also suggests norovirus rates in recent weeks have been highest in the Midwest as well as the Northeast. Figures published by private testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also above previous seasonal peaks for norovirus.",

    "summary": "Abortion bans enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned may be driving Americans to leave restrictive states, researchers find.",
    "story": [
      "When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, the majority of justices decided that the right to an abortion should be left up to individual states. Two years later, thousands of Americans in parts of the U.S. with strict abortion bans are deciding to leave those states, new research finds.",
      "Following the Dobbs decision, the 13 states with strict abortion bans, from Alabama to West Virginia, collectively lost a net 36,000 residents per quarter, meaning the difference between the number of people leaving the states versus those migrating in, according to the analysis from economists at Georgia Institute of Technology and The College of Wooster and published this month by the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "The analysis, which is based on change-of-address data from the U.S. Postal Service, found that the state impact is larger among single-person households, which may suggest that younger people are moving out of abortion-banning states at a higher rate than families. That could be due to the greater challenges for families in trying to move, given the need to change schools or uproot careers for parents.",
      "A problem for states that ban abortion?",
      "While often framed as a cultural or religious issue, access to abortion also has far-reaching economic implications both for individuals and society at large. For instance, the financial toll on women without access to abortion services has been well documented, with the Turnaround Study finding that those denied the procedure had higher rates of financial problems and were more likely to rely on government aid like food stamps.",
      "The new research indicates that states with abortion bans could face long-term economic consequences if they lose significant numbers of residents \u2014 especially younger workers who are typically vital to a state's workforce.",
      "\"In terms of the implications for states' economies, our results suggest that employers in states with bans may face challenges in attracting and retaining workers, especially younger workers, which could impact economic growth and development,\" the researchers, Georgia Institute of Technology's Daniel L. Dench, Jason M. Lindo and Kelly Lifchez and The College of Wooster's Jancy Ling Liu, wrote in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The study didn't discern whether those moving out of states with abortion bans were men or women, or where they landed, including in states that have protected abortion. But the impact is significant enough that, over a five-year period, abortion-banning states could lose almost 1% of their population, the researchers said.",
      "Abortion bans and a weak safety net",
      "Separately, many of the states with strict abortion bans are failing to provide adequate safety nets, an analysis by the Associated Press found. These range from difficulty accessing programs such as food stamps to a lack of access to doctors due to maternal care deserts.",
      "Republican state leaders in Tennessee \u2014 one of the 13 states with a total abortion ban \u2014 argue that they are bolstering services for families. For instance, Tennessee boosted its Medicaid coverage for mothers in 2022 from 60 days postpartum to a year, which enabled an additional 3,000 moms to use the program each year.",
      "But Tennessee fared poorly at enrollment in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, Medicaid, and in having enough maternal care and requirements for paid family and medical leave, according to an October study\u00a0published in the American Journal of Public Health. Other states with abortion bans, including Alabama, Georgia and Missouri, also ranked poorly on a number of measures, the analysis found.",
      "Women with young children in states where abortion is banned or limited to early weeks of pregnancy said it can be tough to obtain social services, according to a\u00a0survey\u00a0by the health policy research organization KFF. Nearly half said it's difficult for women in their state to get food stamps, for example, compared with 3 in 10 in states where abortion is generally available.",
      "\"People who claim to be pro-life, who advocated for these abortion bans, often suggest that these policies are designed to protect children, women and families,\" said Dr. Nigel Madden, lead author of the\u00a0study. But weakness in the safety net shows \"the hypocrisy of that argument.\"",
      "Meanwhile, many younger Americans are paying attention to a state's access to reproductive care. In a 2022 Axios poll, about 6 in 10 people 18- to 29-years-old said a state's abortion laws would sway their decision on where to live from \"somewhat\" to \"a lot.\"",
      "To be sure, there are many reasons why people opt to move out of a particular state, the Georgia Institute of Technology and College of Wooster researchers noted. \"And abortion-ban states are different from states protecting or maintaining abortion access in other ways besides their policies on abortion,\" they added.",
      "But a lack of access to reproductive choice, social services and medical care may make abortion-strict states less attractive to some residents, particularly young Americans, the study concluded.",

      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and theses places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

      "\"This goes beyond a failure of responsibility; it is gross negligence in an area highly vulnerable to wildfires, especially with well-documented weather alerts and high wind risks,\" said Patrick McNicholas, an attorney at McNicholas & McNicholas. \"We are committed to holding Southern California Edison accountable for their alleged negligence and to seeking justice for victims who have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones.\"",
      "In an\u00a0incident report\u00a0sent to the California Public Utilities Commission, SoCal Edison disputed the claim that its equipment started the fire, citing \"no interruptions or electrical or operational anomalies until more than one hour after the reported start time of the fire.\"",
      "\"To date, no fire agency has suggested that SCE's electric facilities were involved in the ignition or requested the removal and retention of any SCE equipment,\" SoCal Edison wrote in its report.",
      "\"SCE understands that a lawsuit related to the Eaton fire has been filed but has not yet been served with the complaint. SCE will review the complaint when it is received. The cause of the fire continues to be under investigation,\" said spokesperson for Southern California Edison.",
      "Additionally, in a statement from last week, SoCal Edison said that the distribution lines immediately to the west of Eaton Cayon were energized well before the reported start time of the fire as part of its public safety power shutoff program.",

      "Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on behalf of residents and a pizzeria owner in the stricken area, the complaint filed against the LADWP contends the country's biggest municipal utility should have kept water in the Santa Ynez Reservoir, which it contended had stood empty for nearly a year.",
      "\"The water supply system servicing Pacific Palisades failed miserably, leaving residents and firefighters with little to no water to fight the blaze,\" Roger Behle, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said on Tuesday in a statement.",
      "In defending the water system, LADWP cited \"unprecedented and extreme water demand to fight the wildfire without aerial support\" for the dearth of water pressure. Some hydrants in high elevations were affected, but the utility \"immediately deployed water tankers\" to back the firefighting efforts.",
      "LADWP is initiating its own investigation \"about water resiliency and how we can enhance our posture to respond to the impacts of climate change,\" the utility said in a statement.",
      "As of Wednesday afternoon, the fires across the LA area had killed at least\u00a025 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and charred more than 60 square miles.

The incident at that individual store, which had a policy of asking non-paying customers to leave, was caught on video and was a major embarrassment for the company.",
      "The change also comes under the new leadership of Brian Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain.

      "Musk started buying shares of Twitter, which he later renamed X, in early 2022. By mid-March, he'd acquired ownership of more than 5% of the company's outstanding stock, according to the SEC filing. He was required to file a report with the SEC disclosing his purchases, but the lawsuit alleges he failed to do so in a \"timely\" manner, allowing him to underpay other investors by at least $150 million for shares they bought during that period.",

    "story": [
      "Capital One was sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for allegedly misleading consumers about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts. As a result, customers lost more than $2 billion in potential interest payments, the lawsuit claims.",
      "In a complaint filed Tuesday, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau took aim at Capital One's promises and handling of its \"360 Savings\" accounts, which were promoted as accounts providing one of the highest interest rates in the nation. But instead, the CFPB alleges, Capital One froze its rate at a low level for at least several years, even as rates rose nationally.",
      "At the same time, the CFPB adds, the bank created \"360 Performance Savings,\" which had a much higher rate \u2014 at one point, more than 14 times higher than the original \"360 Savings\" accounts. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates, part of its effort to fight soaring inflation. As a result, some banks have rolled out high-interest savings accounts to attract savers.",
      "But at the same time, some banks haven't boosted rates on their savings accounts, creating a gap between low-and top-paying accounts, similar to that of Capital One's two offerings. According to the CFPB, Capital One marketed the products similarly to obscure their distinction and forbade employees \"from proactively telling\" those with 360 Savings accounts about the higher-paying 360 Performance Savings, the agency said.",
      "\"Capital One did not specifically notify 360 Savings account holders about the new product, and instead worked to keep them in the dark about these better-paying accounts,\" the CFPB said in a statement. The lawsuit comes at a time when savers have benefitted from the Federal Reserve's decision to ratchet interest rates to fight soaring inflation, which allowed banks to roll out high-interest savings accounts after years of meager rates.",
      "In response, Capital One said that it strongly disagreed with the CFPB's allegations and plans to \"vigorously defend\" itself in court. The banking giant added that it was \"deeply disappointed to see the CFPB continue its recent pattern of filing eleventh-hour lawsuits ahead of a change in administration.\"",
      "Capital One also maintained that all of its 360 banking products \"offer great rates\" \u2014 and have \"always been available in just minutes to all new and existing customers without any of the usual industry restrictions.\"",
      "Billions in lost interest",
      "These actions mean Capital One \"illegally avoided paying billions in interest to millions of consumers,\" the CFPB wrote in its Tuesday complaint. The agency says it's seeking to impose civil penalties and provide financial relief to those impacted.",
      "\"Banks should not be baiting people with promises they can't live up to,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a prepared statement.",
      "According to disclosures on the Capital One's website, 360 Savings accounts currently carry an interest rate of just under 0.50%. 360 Performance Savings accounts have an interest rate of about 3.74%.",
      "That means the rate for 360 Performance Savings is nearly 7.5 times higher than that of 360 Savings today. But the CFPB says they've been farther apart in the past. In July 2024, the agency notes in Tuesday's complaint, the 360 Performance Savings rate was more than 14 times that of 360 Savings.",
      "The CFPB alleges that Capital One kept the rate for its 360 Savings accounts at 0.30% between December 2020 through at least August 2024. The rate for 360 Performance Savings, by contrast, climbed from 0.40% in April 2022 to as high as 4.35% at the start of 2024 \u2014 falling slightly to 4.25% by August, the agency noted Tuesday.",
      "The CFPB's complaint against Capital One comes less than one week before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Despite the change in administration, some say this litigation could still survive.",

      "The\u00a0inspection records, released in response to Freedom of Information Act requests from The Associated Press and other news organizations, appear similar to some of the issues found at the Jarrett, Virginia, plant that was shuttered after at least 10 people died from Boar's Head products contaminated with listeria.",
      "The plants \u2014 located in New Castle, Indiana; Forrest City, Arkansas; and Peterburg, Virginia \u2014 were cited by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for issues such as mold on ceilings, floors and walls, \"unidentified slime\" and \"an abundance of insects.\" The problems cited by USDA inspectors at the three plants date back as far as 2019, according to the documents.",
      "Boar's Head didn't immediately respond to a request from CBS News for comment. The company told The Associated Press that the violations cited at the three factories \"do not meet our high standards.\" The company's remaining plants continue to operate under normal USDA oversight, Boar's Head added.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear. In his first term, he issued an executive order, dubbed \"Buy American and Hire American,\" aimed at supporting U.S. manufacturing. The order also directed Cabinet members to suggest changes to the H-1B program to restrict it only to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants.",
      "But in an interview with The New York Post last month, Trump called H-1B visas a \"great program.\" Musk, who has become a close adviser to the president-elect, said he would \"go to war on this issue\" in one X post.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "By some measures, New York City's traffic is more congested than it's ever been. Enter: Congestion pricing. Since last Sunday, during most hours, cars crossing into the lower half of Manhattan are charged nine dollars. There's a higher toll for trucks.",

      "\"If we can just impact on a proportion of those people, we can make a difference and make it a much better place for everybody,\" said Janno Lieber, who heads the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York's sprawling subway, bus and commuter rail systems. \"We're wasting a ton of money, literally billions of dollars, according to our business leaders, having people stuck in traffic.\"",
      "The haul from congestion pricing will go largely to the MTA, to improve mass transit. According to Lieber, it will raise between $500 and $800 million a year.",
      "The pricing idea began in 1952, and gained traction in the early 2000s. But there've been a lot of bumps in the road. There were lawsuits and protests, for and against.",

      "McDonagh replied, \"Oh, it does? We had a woman that was burned on the subway. We had people being pushed onto the tracks. There's robberies. And if you take the subway in New York, jumping the turnstile now is an Olympic sport.\"",

      "And then there is fare evasion on buses. According to the MTA, 47 percent of riders aren't paying.",
      "\"The MTA has now installed cameras so that they can catch people,\" said Kathy Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which mobilizes business leaders to help the city thrive. \"They are providing police, even the National Guard is in our system to make sure the people pay their fare.\"",
      "Wylde is a longtime advocate for congestion pricing, and has advice for other American cities: \"You have to explain the benefits clearly,\" she said. \"You have to have transit options in most cases. Otherwise, it's just another tax, because if somebody has no choice, they're gonna resist.",
      "\"The lesson from London [is], they put in 200 new bus routes before they turned on congestion pricing,\" Wylde said. \"And that was how they got the public to accept it. They had a choice.\"",
      "It's hard to tell how it's working in New York City after a week, but according to Wylde, \"We're very excited that, in just a few days of congestion pricing, we're seeing a significant reduction in traffic already.\"",
      "Yet, the battle may not be over in New York. Among its opponents: once and future president Donald Trump. Wylde isn't worried, though. \"President Trump has property in New York,\" she said. \"He, I'm sure, has been stuck in traffic more than a few times here.

    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says he was not surprised that Donald Trump won the election: \"People were angry at whatever they called the state \u2013 the 'swamp.' Ineffective government. That people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously. I think it's the lecturing part of it. It's social superiority, it's the 'My way or the highway.' I traveled all over the country; I felt it wherever I went.\"",
      "I asked, \"There's a sense of gloom out there about the economy. Do you understand that?\"",
      "\"I do understand it, 'cause I think there are a lot of legitimate concerns that Americans have. For example, ineffective government, they're angry about it. They're angry about immigration. There're people with legitimate issues.\"",
      "Despite lower unemployment, a calming of inflation, and a soaring stock marker, even he says he's \"cautiously pessimistic\" about the economy. And as head of the largest bank in America, it matters what Dimon has to say about things.",
      "Listen to him on Bitcoin, which he's referred to as \"a Ponzi scheme\" and \"as useless as a pet rock\": \"We are going to have some kind of digital currency at some point. I'm not against crypto. You know, Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value. It's used heavily by sex traffickers, money launderers, ransomware. I just don't feel great about Bitcoin. I applaud your ability to wanna buy or sell it. Just like I think you have the right to smoke, but I don't think you should smoke!\"",
      "Since he took charge of the bank 20 years ago, the company has doubled its number of employees to 320,000, and grown its assets by nearly $3 trillion. Which probably would surprise his grandparents, who came to the U.S. from Greece with little money in the early 1900s.",
      "Dimon spent much of his childhood in an apartment building in a middle-class neighborhood in Queens, New York, sharing a room with his two brothers. Revisiting the street where he grew up, Dimon noted, \"I broke my arm on those monkey bars over there.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did you ever dream when you were growing up, in a million years that you'd be running one of the biggest banks in the world?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"My dad was a stockbroker. So, I was sometimes conscious of that part of the world. But I had never met a CEO until I was in college or something like that.\"",
      "He grew up to be one of most successful CEOs in the country, processing $10 trillion a day.",
      "His bank is thriving and healthy, but Dimon, now 68, has had two major health scares. The first was throat cancer a decade ago.",
      "He says it's in remission: \"But I know a little bit more,\" he said. \"People who have been told they have cancer know a little bit more than other people. That's staring you right in the face and it may actually happen. You become a little more deliberate, a little more thoughtful. You don't want to have regrets.\"",
      "He also had a heart scare in March 2020, at the beginning of COVID. \"My heart, I just, I mean, the pain was extraordinary. I thought I heard it rip. It was an aortic dissection. I had a tear in the aorta.\" He was told he might not make it.",
      "I asked, \"Going in for surgery, you know, at least you think in your mind, 'I've lived the life I should've lived so far'?\"",
      "\"Yeah. Not enough of it, but yeah,\" Dimon laughed.",
      "He woke up after seven or eight hours on the operating table: \"The doctor told me I was one of the only people he's ever seen wake up immediately after surgery like that. I waved at my kids, who had been sitting there the whole time. And then, I was back asleep in the ICU.",
      "\"Waking up in the ICU, I mean, like, when you're a man who's never had to rely on other people really, and all of a sudden you have tubes everywhere and you can't do anything yourself, and you know, you got tubes in your heart and tubes in your lungs and tubes down your jugular\u2026\"",
      "He was in the hospital for a week, back at work a month later, and soon traveling the world, which he does, he says, 40 percent of his time.",
      "We met him in the executive suite on the 43rd floor of the bank's Manhattan headquarters. From there, he can see where he grew up \u2013 and to the left, the nearly-twice-as-high, dazzling new JPMorgan headquarters going up next door, which he says will be taller than the Empire State Building.",
      "With all the big things he deals with, it's interesting that one of the things Dimon is most proud of is opening branches in lower-income and underserved communities around the country. Visiting one branch in Harlem, he noted, \"Mortgage documentation is really hard to do. So, in one of these community branches, a guy stood up and he said he finally bought a home that he'd lived in for 30 years. He said there's no way he could have gotten that mortgage if one of our mortgage loan officers didn't call him every day for months, taking him through it, making him feel comfortable, getting the forms. He got our homeowner's grant. And it works.\"",
      "This isn't a not-for-profit; these local branches make money for the bank.",
      "But what about the other end of the spectrum? Asked about the increasing wealth of the very rich and what might be \"out of whack\" with the system, Dimon replied, \"I think you have to be very careful to say, 'What's outta whack?' You want a healthy economy, and a really healthy economy lifts up all citizens. You want to help all Americans? Grow the economy. You can wail at the moon. That's not going to grow the economy. And if there are unfair things that created some of that wealth, they should be fixed.\"",
      "\"But I'm not hearing you say, 'There's something wrong here that there are these billionaires growing like poppy.' I mean, what is it? The tax laws?\"",
      "\"If I was king for a day, I would probably change a bunch of the tax laws, too, which I'm not gonna give you specifics on. It won't reduce it as much as you seem to think it should be reduced.\"",
      "\"No. But I'm interested that you're not saying, 'This is wrong. This is not working.'\"",
      "\"I think the wrong part is that the bottom 30% didn't do better, not that the top 0.1% did so well.\"",
      "\"Why not?\"",
      "\"They may be unrelated. What we need to do to fix it for everybody \u2026\"",
      "\"But you haven't said what's wrong at the other end?\"",
      "\"I don't know what's wrong at the other end,\" Dimon replied.",
      "Dimon himself is a billionaire. We asked him about the richest person in the world, Elon Musk. \"He's clearly an extraordinary talent,\" Dimon said. \"I mean, to look at Tesla and SpaceX, yeah, well, we should make government more efficient. Is this the way to do it? I don't know. Do I want them to succeed? Absolutely.\"",
      "\"But it's odd to have a man who's so wealthy, with so many important companies that matter to our economy and even to our national security, now sort of insinuating that he can influence right-wing politics in Europe. It doesn't sound right, does it?\"",
      "Dimon said, \"I'm not responsible for his behavior, so let him do it. But when you say it's odd, it's not that odd. It's been going on in this country for a long time. If you go back to Lindbergh, there's been more interfering in cross-Atlantic politics than you would think.\"",
      "\"Are you distressed by it?\"",
      "\"No.\"",
      "\"Take it in stride?\"",
      "\"Take it in stride.\"",
      "\"Somebody called him an oligarch, an American oligarch.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's name-calling.\"",
      "Dimon has been in banking for more than 40 years, which leads to the inevitable question: When will he retire? \"Last time I was asked, I said, less than five years. But when you say retire, I'm not going to retire like that. I may write a book. I may teach. I may work with my kids, if they want. I would never pressure them to work with me.\"",
      "\"I didn't hear you say, 'I might become chairman and, you know, just give up the CEO part.'\"",
      "\"Oh, that's likely. That's likely to happen. Again, that is up to the board, not up to me. But if it makes sense, I may be chairing for a couple years.\"",
      "He says he does not know whom his successor might be. But one thing he does know: \"I love my job. I love what it does. I like our people. It motivates me. Like a lotta people, by Friday I'm exhausted. I want to go home, I want to have my martini and go to sleep! But I do love my job. I think it's great to have a purpose in life.

    "summary": "Conservation groups are concerned that the endangered right whale is vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration signals more support for marine industries.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would\u00a0require more ships to slow down\u00a0in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and\u00a0its population has plummeted\u00a0in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\"While we've been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we've watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\" Brogan said. \"And we've watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\"",
      "Thousands of public comments",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have\u00a0long argued that\u00a0tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups\u00a0sued to try to speed up\u00a0the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\"This is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\" said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \"The way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "What to know about North Atlantic right whales",
      "Right whales are massive creatures that grow to be between 45 and 52 feet in length. Adults can weigh up to 70 tons, according to NOAA. They're identified by signature white calluses on the head.",
      "They were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists were concerned after seeing nearly a quarter of the world's population of the critically endangered North Atlantic\u00a0right whales\u00a0in an unusual and potentially dangerous spot for them, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "The New England Aquarium said at least 82 whales were observed in late July and August during research flights south of New York's Long Island \u2014 hundreds of miles away from\u00a0New England\u00a0and Canadian waters where they are typically seen in the summer.",
      "Aquarium scientist Katherine McKenna told the station that scientists didn't know for sure why the whales were in that area, but they seemed to be following food.",
      "\"They're kind of becoming more unpredictable with what they're doing in response to how the ocean conditions are changing,\" she said.",
      "Why these whales are important",
      "Whales are at the top of the ocean's food chain and they help capture carbon from the atmosphere, according to the international nonprofit World Wildlife Fund.",
      "The right whale is among six out of the 13 great whale species that are classified as endangered or vulnerable.",
      "They numbered more than 480 in 2010, but that fell by more than 25% over the following decade. It has\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0more recently, but the animal remains critically endangered. Vessel strikes are \"a leading cause of the species' decline,\" the National Marine Fisheries Service said in documents.",
      "Conservation groups that have pushed for the finalization of slower ship speed rules said they were motivated in part by documented collision deaths of right whales in recent years. In one much-publicized case last year, a calf stranded off the state of Georgia\u00a0had head injuries\u00a0consistent with a vessel strike, according to government investigators.",

      "His speech also comes hours after he announced a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, a deal the U.S. was heavily involved in negotiating. American hostages will be among those released in the first wave, the president said Wednesday afternoon.",

      "\"Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States,\" he added. \"I have given my heart and my soul to our nation.

      "Mr. Biden has been on an informal farewell tour in recent days. He delivered his final foreign policy speech at the State Department Monday and a speech on his conservation legacy Tuesday. He's also expected to speak Thursday at a Pentagon commander-in-chief farewell ceremony.",
      "In his foreign policy speech, the president sought to make the case that America's position on the global stage and with its allies is stronger than it was when he took office four years ago. But now, the man he blamed for damaging key international relationships and threatening democracy is about to take office again.",
      "Mr. Biden remains the only presidential candidate to defeat Trump, but with the president-elect's defeat of Vice President Kamala Harris, Biden allies and other Democrats fear Trump will undo or undermine much of what they believe Mr. Biden has accomplished.",
      "\"I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake,\" Mr. Biden wrote in the letter. \"And, that's still the case.\"",
      "As Mr. Biden leaves office, he does so with a 39% approval rating, according to Gallup.",

      "On the foreign policy front, Mr. Biden says he's leaving the incoming Trump administration with a \"very strong hand to play.\"",

      "The president also stood by his decision to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan, which brought an end to America's longest war, but cost the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack at the Hamid Karzai Airport in Kabul.",
      "The next administration will inherit its own set of challenges, Mr. Biden pointed out, including a growing relationship between Russia and North Korea, Russia's continued war on Ukraine, tensions in the South China Sea and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.",
      "The economy",
      "The Biden administration has argued the country is better off economically since he took office, pointing to his efforts to lower drug prices, the enactment of the bipartisan infrastructure law and unemployment levels that have remained low.",
      "The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.4% when Mr. Biden took office, with the economy still reeling from the global COVID pandemic. The president leaves office with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in December.",
      "Mr. Biden said in the letter that he entered office under the \"worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,\" while touting that four years later, \"we have the strongest economy in the world and have created a record 16.6 million new jobs.\"",
      "But inflation has also battered Americans' pocketbooks and voters who sent Republicans to the White House and Congress cited inflation and higher prices as their top issue.",
      "Inflation has risen more than 20% since Mr. Biden took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And\u00a0 some key expenses have climbed at a faster rate, including groceries and car insurance premiums.",
      "Between higher home costs and higher interest rates, the monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage on a new home has nearly doubled since Mr. Biden took office.",
      "Key legislation",
      "The bipartisan infrastructure legislation he pushed and Congress passed in 2021 remains one of the most tangible legislative accomplishments of Mr. Biden's presidency, allowing for the rebuilding of bridges, public transportation and other infrastructure priorities.",
      "In 2022, Congress passed the most significant gun control legislation in decades, with Republican support. It expanded firearm background checks, and addressed the ties between gun violence and mental health.",
      "The Inflation Reduction Act, though criticized for doing little to lower inflation, did make it possible for the administration to embark on negotiations to lower drug costs. The law also contained the most significant climate change measures ever enacted.",
      "Pardoning his son",
      "An inevitable part of the president's legacy will be his decision, on Thanksgiving weekend, to offer a full and unconditional pardon to his son Hunter for felony gun crimes and tax evasion.",
      "Securing a hostage and ceasefire deal in the Middle East",
      "Bringing home the Americans captured by Hamas and putting a halt to war in the Middle East has been a key priority for the Biden administration since Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. But a deal long remained elusive, as the U.S. and other negotiating countries sought to broker a deal. Still, the Biden administration, in coordination with the Trump transition team, worked hard for a deal before Mr. Biden leaves office. The president was finally able to announce that deal hours before his farewell speech.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the State Department as secretary of state, called China \"the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted\" during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that largely focused on U.S. relations with the nation.",
      "\"The 21st Century will be defined by what happens between the United States and China,\" Rubio told his Senate colleagues, reiterating his long-held belief that the U.S. must push back on China's influence more forcefully.",
      "\"They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed,\" Rubio said. \"They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor now \u2014 in every realm. It is an extraordinary challenge.\"",
      "Rubio is likely to sail through the confirmation process to become the nation's top diplomat. He received a warm reception from members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which he is a member, who praised his extensive foreign policy experience.",
      "The confirmation hearing occurred as Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire and hostage release deal, U.S. officials said. Senate Foreign Relations chair Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican, announced at the hearing that he had been advised that a deal had been reached, with Rubio commenting that all those involved \"deserve credit for the deal.\"",
      "At times throughout the hearing, Rubio defended the decisions of his former rival, Trump, as he faced questions about the incoming president's potential conflicts of interest abroad and offered a strong defense of NATO despite Trump's past criticism of the defense alliance.",
      "\"Under President Trump, the top priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States,\" Rubio said.",
      "Like during and after the first World War, Rubio declared that the U.S. is once again \"called to create a free world out of the chaos.\"",
      "\"And this will not be easy,\" Rubio continued. \"And it will be impossible without a strong and a confident America that engages in the world, putting our core national interests, once again, above all else.\"",
      "Rubio, who has taken hardline positions on China, Iran, Venezuela and Cuba, will inherit the position facing a number of global challenges, including Russia's war in Ukraine, persistent violence in the Middle East, China's aggression against Taiwan and its tense relationship with the U.S. Trump has also suggested using military force or coercion to gain control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. He's floated annexing Canada as the 51st state and has threatened trade wars with U.S. allies.",
      "Rubio on China",
      "In the Senate, Rubio has been among the most outspoken on China, saying the nation is the \"threat that will define this century.\" Members of both parties have since adopted his positions on China.",
      "As well as warning about the national security risks, Rubio has also sought to hold China accountable for human rights abuses. In 2020, Beijing responded to Rubio's criticisms by banning him from the country. It's unclear what will become of that ban once he takes office and is tasked with carrying out Trump's foreign policy goals.",
      "Rubio told senators that much of China's growth has come at the expense of the U.S. and \"in less than 10 years, virtually everything that matters to us in life will depend on whether China will allow us to have it or not.\"",
      "\"Indeed, I've been strongly worded in my views of China. Let me just point out they've said mean things about me, too,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"My role now as a secretary of state is to lead the diplomatic wing of the country and that will involve engaging them.\"",
      "Rubio said it was in the interest of both countries to be able to communicate to avoid an armed conflict.",
      "\"Never in the history of mankind have two powers like the United States and China ever faced off in a global conflict, and the outcome would be catastrophic, and we should want to avoid it, and so should they,\" he said.",
      "Rubio on Ukraine and NATO",
      "The Florida Republican called for an end to the war in Ukraine, which has carried on for nearly three years since Russia invaded its neighbor in February 2022.",
      "\"This war has to end,\" he said, adding that there should be a \"ceasefire.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the committee, asked Rubio about his seeming shift in what was once full-throated support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia. Rubio voted against a foreign aid package last April that included assistance for Ukraine, despite his earlier support for the country. During the 2024 campaign, Trump criticized the Biden administration for sending billions to Ukraine in aid.",
      "\"I voted against that bill because I said I would not vote for a bill unless it addressed the crisis at our southern border as part of the overall arrangement,\" Rubio said. \"That was not done, and so I voted against it. That said, here's my view of the situation: Once this war became what we now know it is, and that is, a war of attrition, a stalemate, a protracted conflict, the dynamic on that situation has changed. It has.\"",
      "Rubio says Cuba a state sponsor of terrorism",
      "Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, whose father fled Cuba, asked Rubio whether he believes Cuba is a state sponsor of terrorism.",
      "\"Without a question,\" Rubio responded.",
      "A day before Rubio's confirmation hearing, the Biden administration announced it is moving to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and ease economic restrictions as part of a deal for the release of political prisoners.",
      "Rubio, a supporter of strong sanctions on Havana's Communist regime, said it has been friendly towards Hamas and Hezbollah, hosts espionage stations for two countries hostile to the U.S., has strong ties to Iran and harbors fugitives from the American justice system.",
      "\"So there is zero doubt in my mind that they meet all the qualifications for being a state sponsor of terrorism,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he would reverse the Biden administration's determination, Rubio said that was ultimately Trump's call but said \"nothing that was agreed to is irreversible or binding on the new administration.\"",
      "Panama Canal and Greenland",
      "The Panama Canal and Greenland, which have both received recent attention from Trump, were also topics of interest during the hearing.",

      "Murphy said Trump and his family have become \"more deeply dependent on revenue from governments in the Middle East,\" pointing to specific business deals.",

That's just extraordinary,\" Murphy said. \"Never before in the history of this country has a president been, I mean literally, receiving cash from foreign governments and from foreign companies that are backed by foreign governments in the middle of their term. If you or I had done this as senators, we would be in violent violation of Senate ethics rules. That's not permitted on the Foreign Relations Committee.\"",
      "Murphy asked Rubio if he views profiting from Middle East deals as a potential conflict of interest, and whether he will bring that up with Trump. Rubio said he isn't a participant of or very familiar with Trump's overseas business deals, saying Trump's family members who are private citizens are running those companies.",
      "\"All I can tell you is that what I've said from the very beginning from the opening statement, and that is our foreign policy is going to be driven, as the president's made abundantly clear, by whether some action is in the good of the United States and our national security,\" Rubio said.",
      "Pressed further, Rubio specifically said Trump's family members have a right to conduct business deals abroad, and he doesn't believe Trump will allow personal business deals to adversely affect U.S. interests.",
      "\"The president doesn't manage that company,\" Rubio responded. \"His family members do, and they have a right to be in the business. I mean, that's the business that they're in. They're in the real estate business, they've been for a very long time, both domestically and abroad. They have properties in multiple countries. So, at the end of the day, his family is entitled to continue to operate their business.\"",
      "\"The fundamental question is not whether his family is involved in business. The fundamental question is whether that is in any way impacting the conduct of our foreign policy in a way that's counter to our national interest. And the president's made it abundantly clear that every decision he makes and every decision we are to make at the State Department should be driven by whether or not it serves the core national interests of the United States,\" he said.",
      "Who is Marco Rubio?",
      "Rubio, 53, was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in May 1956. His father was a banquet bartender and his mother worked as a hotel maid. According to his Senate website, Rubio \"was drawn to public service in large part because of his grandfather, who saw his homeland destroyed by communism.\"",
      "Rubio's long political career began when he served as city commissioner in West Miami after he earned degrees from the University of Florida and the University of Miami Law School. He was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, where he served until 2008, including two years as speaker.",
      "The Florida Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2010 and won his third six-year term in 2022. He has served on both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as vice chair on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Rubio was among a crowded field of GOP candidates running for president in 2016. He ended his campaign after losing the primary to Trump in his home state of Florida. The two verbally sparred during the campaign, with Rubio calling Trump \"a con artist\" who was hijacking the Republican Party and \"the most vulgar person\" to ever run for president. Trump sought to diminish his rival by nicknaming him \"Little Marco.\"",
      "Still, Rubio endorsed Trump for president after dropping out of the race and the two formed a pragmatic relationship in the years since. Trump eyed Rubio as a possible running mate in the 2024 race, but settled on Sen. JD Vance of Ohio instead.",
      "Does Marco Rubio have the votes to be confirmed?",
      "Rubio is all but certain to be confirmed, even with some Democratic support. A number of Senate Democrats have praised Trump's choice and have pledged to support his nomination on the floor, giving him many more than the 50 votes he needs for confirmation, barring something unforeseen.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia was among the Democrats to compliment Rubio, saying he was \"extremely well-prepared.\"",
      "\"He's not talking out of a briefing book. He's not having to thumb through a binder to decide how to answer a particular question,\" Kaine said.",
      "Others spoke about their personal relationships with Rubio. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois recalled how Rubio helped push for Senate rules to be amended so that she could bring her newborn daughter with her on the floor to votes.",
      "\"What's the big deal? This place is already full of babies,\" Rubio remembered saying.",
      "Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, who met with Rubio on Monday, called the Florida Republican \"a good choice\" and said he \"has a thorough understanding of the United States' role on an international scale.\"",
      "\"I plan to vote yes on his nomination when it comes before the Senate,\" Durbin, a top Senate Democrat, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Pam Bondi sought to allay the concerns of Democrats who said they feared Trump and his allies would use the Justice Department to target their political enemies.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, vowed to end the \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying her focus will be on reducing crime and upholding the law.",
      "The former Florida attorney general, who represented Trump during his first impeachment, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about her nomination, which is all but certain to be approved in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "She spent much of the hearing seeking to allay concerns from skeptical Democrats that Trump would use the Justice Department to target his political enemies once in office.",
      "\"There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said, adding that she believes prosecutors under President Biden unfairly targeted Trump for the last four years.",
      "\"I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"The partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "Democrats did not seem convinced, repeatedly pressing Bondi on whether she'd investigate and prosecute figures ranging from former Rep. Liz Cheney and former special counsel Jack Smith to journalists and Trump critics.",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, a role she held for two terms.",
      "\"If confirmed as the next attorney general of the United States, my overriding objective will be to return the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously prosecuting criminals,\" Bondi said in her opening statement.",
      "Bondi said her time as a local prosecutor framed her goals for the Justice Department, which she described as \"getting back to the basics\" of combating crime and reducing recidivism.",
      "Republicans on the committee largely focused on Bondi's decades of crimefighting experience as a local prosecutor, and later as Florida attorney general. They claimed the Justice Department has been \"weaponized\" in recent years for political reasons, pointing to the prosecutions of Trump that have been dropped since the election.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat, noted Bondi's experience, but said it is Trump who has vowed to use the Justice Department to target his political enemies. Durbin said he wants assurances that Bondi would keep the Justice Department independent, and would be willing to say \"no\" to Trump. Trump clashed with his two attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, over decisions they made in his first term.",
      "Durbin asked Bondi if she accepted that Trump lost the election in 2020, a fact that he and many of his prominent supporters have not publicly acknowledged. Bondi stopped short of doing so Wednesday.",
      "\"There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024,\" Bondi said. Bondi told Durbin that she \"accept[s] the results\" of the 2020 election but declined to say outright that Mr. Biden won.",
      "Durbin asked if Bondi would support pardons for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Bondi said, if asked, she would review potential pardons on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, asked Bondi if she would \"be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper.\"",
      "\"Senator, I wouldn't work at a law firm, I wouldn't be a prosecutor, I wouldn't be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out, of course I would not do that,\" Bondi said. \"That's one of the main things you learn as a young prosecutor, is to do the right thing.\"",
      "Later, she told Coons she and the president-elect have not discussed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden \u2014 a threat Trump has made. Throughout the hearing, she argued she would keep the Justice Department independent from the White House, including by upholding a department policy limiting contacts with White House officials.",
      "Bondi was repeatedly pressed by Democrats about whether she would target perceived Trump foes, including Cheney and Smith, who led the dual federal investigations against Trump. During one particularly heated exchange, she declined to say if she knew of any factual predicate for investigating Cheney, and told California Sen. Adam Schiff his concerns are misplaced.",
      "\"You're all so worried about Liz Cheney, senator, you know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof,\" she said.",
      "Bondi was also asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, about the reauthorization of Section 702, a government intelligence collection tool that has come under fire from some Republicans in Congress. She said she would take a look at the issue and called Section 702 a \"very important tool.\"",
      "Bondi's nomination",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee was one of several taking place before GOP-led panels this week as Trump prepares to begin his second term in office. Republicans have indicated they plan to give substantial deference to Trump as he fills out the top ranks of his administration and are aiming to install key Cabinet officials to their posts soon after the president-elect is inaugurated Monday.",
      "Bondi spent the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, and she is not expected to face significant hurdles in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Durbin accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm and said he was concerned Bondi will prioritize fealty to Trump over loyalty to the Constitution. He met with Bondi last week.",
      "Bondi was term-limited in her position as Florida's attorney general and left office in 2019. While in office, she spearheaded lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 and then-President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "She went on to serve as an attorney and lobbyist at the firm Ballard Partners. There, she represented large corporations like General Motors, Amazon, Uber and the American Institute Against Human Trafficking, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying. And she submitted a registration with the federal government to lobby on behalf of Qatar \"regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"",
      "At her hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"very proud of the work that I did\" with Qatar, telling Durbin her work was focused on \"anti-human trafficking efforts related to the World Cup.\"",
      "\"I was registered as FARA along with many members of my firm. That was the sole portion of my representation for Qatar,\" she said, referencing a federal law that requires lobbyists who work for foreign countries to register with the government.",
      "During Trump's first term, Bondi briefly left her lobbying position to serve as a member of his defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats. She defended Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Mr. Biden.",
      "The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation, making him just the third U.S. president to ever be impeached. The Republican-led Senate then acquitted him following a trial, where Bondi was part of the team representing Trump.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Bondi spearheaded legal efforts to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and pushed the false claim that Trump won the state. She was asked about that work in Wednesday's hearing.",
      "\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened?\" Bondi said. \"No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country. We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the law to be followed.\"",
      "Bondi was also among the Trump allies who traveled to New York and spoke out in defense of the president-elect early last year during his \"hush money\" criminal trial. A jury convicted Trump on 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in May and he was sentenced last week.",
      "After the Justice Department brought criminal charges against Trump in 2023, Bondi told Fox News, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them.\"",
      "If confirmed, she will now lead that department and will have the power to look into various aspects of the investigations into Trump that were led by Smith. She will also oversee the numerous law enforcement components under the Justice Department, including the FBI and the ATF, two organizations that have been targets of the president-elect and his allies.",
      "Bondi will also oversee implementation of aspects of Trump's agency and lead the department that will defend the president-elect's actions in federal court.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:45:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas and 18 other states have recently enacted laws requiring pornography websites to verify the ages of their visitors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday grappled with states' efforts to require pornography websites to verify their visitors' ages amid a surge of laws that proponents say are aimed at protecting children from accessing sexual content on the internet.",
      "The requirement at the center of the case was enacted by Texas in 2023 as part of a wave of similar measures that have been passed in 18 other states. Under Texas' law, a website must use \"reasonable age verification methods\" to confirm visitors are at least 18 years old.",
      "Entities must comply with the law if more than one-third of its web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Covered companies have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators of the age-verification requirement face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day, or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "During more than two hours of arguments, the justices seemed to agree that the government has an interest in restricting minors' access to harmful sexual material. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who has young children, acknowledged that advancements in technology have made it easier for kids to access pornography through gaming systems, tablets and smart phones. Chief Justice John Roberts, too, said technological access to pornography has \"exploded,\" and there has been a \"dramatic change\" in how it can be accessed.",
      "But the justices also expressed concern that age-verification laws like those enacted in 19 states burden adults' access to content they are legally allowed to consume and could lead to more regulations based on content.",
      "Derek Shaffer, who argued on behalf of a trade group representing the adult entertainment industry, said Texas' law is the worst among those that have been passed in recent years and called the state a \"hostile regulator.\"",
      "The case arrived at the Supreme Court after a federal district court granted a preliminary injunction blocking Texas' age-verification requirement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit then froze that decision, allowing the law to take effect. The Supreme Court in April declined to temporarily block enforcement of the law, but\u00a0agreed to take up\u00a0the legal battle months later.",
      "Challengers to the age-verification measure \u2014 a group of companies that operate pornography website and the Free Speech Coalition, the trade group \u2014 are asking the Supreme Court to toss out the 5th Circuit's ruling and restore the district court's injunction. They argued the measure violates the First Amendment because it burdens adults' access to protected speech.",
      "The posture of the case was an issue raised by several members of the court, and particularly what would happen if they wiped clean the 5th Circuit's decision. The question before the high court is whether the 5th Circuit applied the correct standard of judicial review when it evaluated Texas' age-verification law.",
      "The appeals court applied the least-stringent level of review, known as rational-basis review. Using that standard, the 5th Circuit said the law survives because of evidence showing \"the sort of damage that access to pornography does to children.\" But the law's challengers and the Biden administration argue that the appeals court should've applied the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' access to constitutionally protected speech.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under scrutiny scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",
      "\"This case matters because it's about how the government can treat speech it doesn't like, and pornography is often the canary in the coal mine for free speech. And it also matters because it's about the future of free speech online,\" Vera Eidelman, a lawyer with the ACLU, said in a press call.",
      "Opponents of the Texas law argue that if it is allowed to stand, it could have a chilling effect on adult visitors to regulated websites. Additionally, it could open users' to privacy and security risks like data breaches, which don't arise when having an ID checked in-person, they argued in court filings.",
      "Already, Pornhub, one of the largest adult content websites, blocked access in Texas last year and did the same in Florida at the start of this year after its own age-verification law took effect.",
      "\"When an adult site tries to do age verification, most people coming to that site refuse to do a face scan, biometrics, ID upload, whatever it is. There's a huge chilling effect. People don't want to do it,\" said Mike Stabile, director of public policy for the Free Speech Coalition.",
      "The trade group argued in court papers that Texas could have employed a less-restrictive way of protecting children from sexual material: content-filtering software, which the Supreme Court backed in a 2004 decision blocking the federal Child Online Protection Act. Additionally, they said the law regulates more speech than is necessary, since it applies to an entire website if more than one-third of its content is considered sexual material harmful to minors, and sweeps in material like romance novels and R-rated movies.",
      "For example, they said, \"a website that contains 65% core political speech and 35% sexually suggestive content would be 100% subject to H.B. 1181's restrictions. That is paradigmatic overinclusivity.\"",
      "But the law is also underinclusive since search engines and social media sites do not have to comply with age-verification requirements, even though minors can access the content there that Texas is trying to shield them from, the Free Speech Coalition argued.",
      "But conservative members of the court said the landscape has changed considerably since the court's 2004 decision and content-filtering has become less effective at keeping minors from accessing sexual material.",
      "\"We're in an entirely different world,\" Justice Clarence Thomas said.",
      "The Biden administration argued the law is subject to the most demanding form of judicial scrutiny and urged the Supreme Court to toss out the 5th Circuit's decision and send the case back to the appeals court to apply strict scrutiny.",
      "But in doing so, the Supreme Court should clarify that Congress and states can adopt appropriately tailored measures to keep children from accessing harmful sexual content online, Brian Fletcher, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices.",
      "Meanwhile, Texas Solicitor General Aaron Nielson, who argued for the state, said its age-verification requirement is \"simple\" and \"safe.\"",
      "He wrote in a filing that state officials were responding to a public health crisis sparked by kids' easy access to \"hardcore pornography\" through smartphones and other devices when they enacted the restriction.",
      "The age-veritification requirements, he said, \"protects children from that which is obscene by [adults'] standards, by requiring the purveyors to check whether their viewers are children \u2014 leaving adults able to access pornography by engaging in a process that they must complete potentially only once and that applies equally to viewing pornography, buying wine, or renting a car.\"",
      "Backing Texas in the dispute is a group of 24 states, officials from which are urging the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court's decision.",
      "The states wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief that age-verification laws are a routine exercise of their authority to protect children from being exposed to sexual violence and explicit images. They noted that most online pornography is not constitutionally protected, as it is considered obscene to minors and adults under a Supreme Court standard set in 1973.",
      "\"Texas's age-verification law effectuates the state's deeply important interest in protecting minors from the psychological, physical, and social harms wrought by the hardcore internet pornography petitioners purvey \u2014 an interest all agree is compelling, and that this court should hesitate to override,\" the states, led by the attorneys general of Ohio and Indiana, wrote.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June 2025.",

    "summary": "Trump's pick to be CIA director promised in his confirmation hearing to hone in on setting strong intelligence collection priorities and \"demanding relentless execution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump. He told Ratcliffe he has an opportunity at his confirmation hearing to \"reassure the men and women of the CIA that they not fear reprisal for being willing to speak truth to power.\"",
      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",
      "Ratcliffe's nomination",
      "Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Trump's picks for other roles, since he has served in a Senate-confirmed position once already and was also a member of Congress.",
      "As intelligence director, he was criticized by Democrats for declassifying in the final days of the 2020 presidential election Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true. But like top intelligence officials of Republican and Democratic administrations, he has also been warning for years of the threat posed by China to U.S. interests.",
      "China was among the topics at Wednesday's hearing, and in December 2020, Ratcliffe wrote that China \"poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.\" Ratcliffe, who was the nation's spy chief at the time, said he had shifted resources in the intelligence budget to make China more of a priority.",
      "\"Beijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation with the U.S. Washington should also be prepared. Leaders must work across partisan divides to understand the threat, speak about it openly, and take action to address it,\" he wrote.",

      "\"Although we found no adverse consequences to Defense Department operations arising from how the hospitalizations we reviewed were handled, the risks to our national defense, including the command and control of the Defense Department's critical national security operations, were increased unnecessarily,\" Inspector General Robert Storch said in a statement.",
      "Austin was hospitalized for two weeks at the start of 2024 for complications related to surgery to treat prostate cancer. The Pentagon faced sharp criticism for waiting several days to inform the White House that Austin was in the hospital \u2014 and at one point, in the intensive care unit.",
      "The review did not identify any adverse impacts on operational command and control or Defense Department functions but says, \"we believe that there was a potential for adverse effects.\"",
      "A senior defense official told reporters shortly after the report was released, that the review \"found that at no time, was there a break in command and control\" and \"at every moment, either the secretary of defense or the deputy secretary of defense was fully prepared to support the president as commander-in-chief.\"",
      "The report states that during the course of his hospitalization, Austin transferred authority of some of his duties to his deputy secretary of defense from Jan. 2 to 5, but neither of them notified Congress or the White House Situation Room in a \"timely manner\" as required.",
      "The report found that Austin did not consider transferring authorities while he was undergoing medical procedures on Jan. 6 and 8 that required moderate sedation. The inspector general found no evidence that Austin told the deputy secretary or his chief of staff he was undergoing the procedures. According to the review, Austin had texted his chief of staff that he did not want his medical condition to become \"a media circus.\"",
      "Austin told the inspector general investigators he told his doctors he would have to notify his superiors if he underwent general anesthesia. He signed forms acknowledging moderate sedation but said he needed to remain functional as \"that was the mandate \u2026 and I'm confident that that happened.\" He said that his doctors met his \"requirement to remain \u2026 functional.\"",
      "Nevertheless, the inspector general in its 20 recommendations said the Defense Department should further define what is \"medically incapacitated,\" and the phrase, \"unable to perform the functions and duties.\" Other recommendations include expanding the scope of who is required to report the hospitalization of secretaries of defense or senior Pentagon officials.",
      "The inspector general announced last year it would initiate a review to: \"examine the roles, processes, procedures, responsibilities, and actions related to the Secretary of Defense's hospitalization in December 2023 \u2013 January 2024, and assess whether the DoD's policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure timely and appropriate notifications and the effective transition of authorities as may be warranted due to health-based or other unavailability of senior leadership.\"",
      "The review found that Austin's intense privacy affected the course of events. It says that not only did Austin not tell his senior staff members of his medical condition or appointments, \"he specifically told one junior staff member 'if anyone had any questions they're more than welcome to ask [me] directly.'\"",
      "After he returned to work at the Pentagon following his hospitalization, Austin apologized for not telling President Biden or the public about when and why he had been hospitalized.",
      "\"We did not handle this right, and I did not handle this right,\" Austin said. \"I should have told the president about my cancer diagnosis. I should have also told my team and the American public. And I take full responsibility. I apologize to my teammates and to the American people.\"",
      "The senior defense official said Austin \"apologized and he committed to improving transparency and processes moving forward, which the department has already done over the past year to ensure it doesn't happen again.\"",
      "CBS News obtained the audio of the 911 call that led to the hospitalization in which an aide asked the operator if the ambulance headed to Austin's residence could be discreet.",
      "\"Can I ask that, can the ambulance not show up with lights and sirens? We're trying to remain a little subtle,\" the caller is heard saying.",
      "A separate review by the Pentagon released last year concluded that there was no deliberate ill intent by Austin or his aides to keep the hospitalization secret but did acknowledge the policies for transferring the responsibilities of the secretary need to be improved.",
      "Austin told David Martin during a \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview that he is now cancer-free.",
      "\"I thank God for that,\" Austin said.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:59:05 -0500",
    "summary": "In remarks to Congress, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Justice Department said that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end\" under her watch.",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who met with Bondi last week, accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm, expressing concern that she might prioritize loyalty to Trump over the Constitution.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,\" Bondi said, name-checking a campaign tagline of the president-elect. \"That is what the American people expect and deserve from the Department.\u00a0 If confirmed, I will do what it takes to make America safe again.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:41:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The fast-moving legal battle over the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report played out days before Trump's second-term inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland has submitted to Congress a portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump and released it to the public after a court order blocking its release expired at midnight Tuesday.",
      "Smith wrote in his report that his office began its prosecution of Trump because it had enough evidence against him, that \"[b]ut for Mr. Trump's election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.\"",
      "The report was sent to Congress, a source familiar with the matter confirmed, and made public shortly after following days of legal wrangling over whether it \u2014 or part of it \u2014 should be disclosed to the public. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon on Monday declined a request from Walt Nauta, an aide to Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, to block volume one of Smith's final report from becoming public.",
      "That portion pertains to Trump's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Volume two delves into allegations that Trump unlawfully held onto classified documents after the end of his first term in 2021 and obstructed the Justice Department's investigation.",
      "In a letter to Garland accompanying the report, Smith defended his decision to pursue charges against the president-elect and rejected Trump's accusations that his actions were influenced by the top ranks of the Justice Department.",
      "\"To all who know me well, the claim from Mr. Trump that my decisions as a prosecutor were influenced or directed by the Biden administration or other political actors is, in a word, laughable,\" Smith wrote, adding later in the report his office had \"no interest in affecting the presidential election.\"",
      "Following the release of the section of the report on the 2020 election probe, the president-elect attacked the former special counsel on social media, calling him a \"a lamebrain prosecutor who was unable to get his case tried before the Election, which I won in a landslide.\"",
      "\"To show you how desperate Deranged Jack Smith is, he released his Fake findings at 1:00 A.M. in the morning,\" Trump said early Tuesday.",
      "Smith used the first volume of his report to defend his work and investigative findings, alleging, \"The throughline of all of Mr. Trump's criminal efforts was deceit \u2014 knowingly false claims of election.\"",
      "Much of the 137-page volume recounts information that has already been made public through court filings during the course of the now-dismissed case against Trump filed in Washington, D.C. It also includes images of the violence that transpired at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump's supporters breached the building in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming President Biden's win.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that the rioters who descended on the Capitol \"had been motivated and directed by Trump,\" a claim Trump has denied. The former special counsel wrote that his office was \"prepared\" to prove \"Trump willfully caused his supporters to obstruct and attempt to obstruct the proceeding by summoning them to Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Still, Smith wrote that his office \"did not develop direct evidence \u2014 such as an explicit admission or communication with co-conspirators \u2014 of Mr. Trump's subjective intent to cause the full scope of the violence that occurred on January 6.\"",
      "Now, four years since the Jan. 6 attack, more than 1,500 people have been charged as a result of their conduct at the Capitol. The former special counsel wrote that \"with that in mind, Mr. Trump's relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.\"",
      "Smith revealed that through voluntary interviews of more than 250 individuals and the grand-jury testimony of 55 people, his office was able to gather evidence that pointed to Trump's alleged crime, including allegations that he sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence into delaying the vote certification on Jan. 6, 2021, and he supported the organization of a false slate of electors.",
      "Pence sat for a grand-jury interview with prosecutors during the investigation, CBS News reported at the time.",
      "The former special counsel also detailed ways in which he alleged Trump sought to pressure the Justice Department at the time to investigate the false claims of fraud. At one point, according to the report, Trump allegedly told his acting attorney general to \"just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\"",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Trump with four counts in the summer of 2023. He pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. But Smith wrote that his office considered \u2014 and ultimately decided against \u2014 bringing other charges. One potential charge was under the Insurrection Act, a Civil War-era law that bars those who incite an insurrection against the U.S. from holding federal office.",
      "But Smith said that while courts have described the Jan. 6 attack as an \"insurrection,\" his office was \"aware of the litigation risk that would be presented by employing this long-dormant statute.\"",
      "Trump was charged with allegedly participating in crimes with at least six unnamed co-conspirators, and Smith wrote that his office determined some shared criminal culpability with the president-elect. Smith said that after Trump was indicted in August 2023, his office continued to look into whether any of the other alleged participants should face charges. He said that he referred to a U.S. attorney's office for further investigation evidence that one individual may have committed unrelated crimes.",
      "Smith's office made a \"preliminary determination\" that admissible evidence could justify pursuing charges against some of Trump's co-conspirators and had started to look into how to proceed. But because his team did not reach a conclusion or seek any further indictments, Smith wrote that the report \"should not be read to allege that any particular person other than Mr. Trump committed a crime, nor should it be read to exonerate any particular person.\"",
      "Ahead of the report's release, Trump's defense attorneys asked Garland to remove Smith from his post and either decline to release the special counsel's report or hand the matter over to Trump's incoming administration, according to a letter released last week.",
      "The letter, addressed to Garland and a top career official at the Justice Department, alleged the special counsel did not have the legal authority to submit a final report summarizing his investigations into Trump and urged the attorney general to \"put an end to this weaponization of the justice system and move forward constructively.\"",
      "The correspondence was written in part by defense attorneys Todd Blanche and Emile Bove, Trump's picks to serve as deputy attorney general and principal deputy attorney general in his new administration.",
      "Trump has slammed Smith's investigation as politically motivated and denied all wrongdoing in the case.",
      "The legal battle over Smith's report on Trump",
      "The Justice Department's publication of the first volume of Smith's report marked the culmination of a fast-moving legal battle that transpired over the past week and played out days before Trump is to be sworn in for a second term. If the battle had continued until the president-elect's return to the White House on Jan. 20, it's not likely the special counsel's report would have been publicly released.",
      "Cannon, who was assigned to oversee the documents case, issued a temporary order last week that temporarily blocked the Justice Department from making the report public, after which a federal appeals court declined to stop its release. The district judge's order expired at 12 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Garland has said he wouldn't publicly release the second part of the report because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing.",
      "Smith resigned his position as special counsel last Friday, and Justice Department prosecutors have taken over the ongoing matters arising from his investigations. Smith's two probes led to separate prosecutions of Trump, but they came to a close because of his victory in the November presidential election.",
      "As is required for special counsels, Smith drafted and submitted a final report to the attorney general last week. Garland has vowed to make public all special counsel reports completed while he is attorney general, and has so far followed through on that pledge, including after the investigation into Mr. Biden's handling of classified documents. He released the special counsel's final report on the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax evasion and gun possession cases Monday night.",
      "Last week, Garland informed Congress that Smith had finished his investigation and submitted the two-volume report. It's unclear whether the second volume, related to the classified documents case, will ever be disclosed to the American people.",
      "Smith's tenure as special counsel began in November 2022, when Garland tapped him to take over the ongoing investigations involving Trump. The president-elect repeatedly vowed to fire the special counsel when he returned to the White House.",
      "Federal grand juries returned two indictments against the president-elect, marking the first time a former president was accused of federal crimes. In the 2020 election case, brought in Washington, D.C., Trump faced four charges, including conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding. In the documents case, the president-elect was charged with 40 counts, including willfully retaining national defense information and conspiracy to obstruct justice.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and accused Smith of mounting a politically charged investigation against him because he was Mr. Biden's political rival.",
      "The 2020 election case landed before the Supreme Court with Trump's claim he was entitled to presidential immunity that shielded him from prosecution, since the conduct that gave rise to the charges occurred during his first term in office.",
      "In July, the high court issued a landmark ruling finding that former presidents cannot face charges for official acts, but were not immune from prosecution for unofficial actions. The decision led to further proceedings before the federal district court overseeing the case.",
      "But the charges were dismissed in November following Trump's election to a second term, as longstanding Justice Department policy forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",

      "Following U.S. flag code, President Biden ordered flags to be lowered through the end of January out of respect for former President Jimmy Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The code says the U.S. flag should be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the death of a president or former president at all federal government buildings and grounds, including U.S. embassies and military facilities abroad.",

      "The bill, known as the \"Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,\" would amend Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, to recognize a person's \"sex\" as \"based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.\" Schools who allow \"a person whose sex is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls\" risk losing federal funding.",
      "It passed in the House with 218 voting in favor, 206 voting against and one voting present. Two Democrats from Texas \u2014 Reps. Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez \u2014 joined all Republicans in support of the bill. Democratic Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina voted present.",

      "The president-elect said he will establish the agency on Inauguration Day, with the goal of making other countries pay \"their fair share.\" Tariffs are taxes levied on imported foreign goods. Experts say higher tariffs are typically passed on to the consumer, and if enacted, Trump's tariff hikes will likely mean higher costs for Americans.",
      "\"Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources. We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service.

While USTR and the Commerce Department establish tariffs, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is the primary collector and enforcer of tariffs. CBP then deposits collections into the General Fund of the United States.",
      "Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all goods coming from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% across-the-board tariffs on all foreign imports, and tariffs of 60% or higher on Chinese goods. Despite Trump's vows, some Wall Street economists believe it's unlikely that the new administration would enact a broad-based tariff on all imports due to the potential to reignite inflation while spurring retaliatory tariffs from other nations.",
      "Federal law allows presidents to adjust tariffs based on stated threats to national security, or to remove the practice of a foreign government that the U.S. believes is violating an international trade agreement or is unfair or discriminatory. Trump heavily relied on his tariff authority in his first term, and President Biden's team didn't undo all of his tariffs. The Biden administration even imposed additional tariff hikes, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles from China.",
      "The conservative Tax Foundation found that, despite Trump's fondness for tariffs, the Biden administration has collected more revenue through tariffs on foreign goods than did Trump's \u2014 $89.1 billion under Trump compared with $144 billion under Mr. Biden, as of March 2024. The bulk of revenue under both presidents was collected through tariffs on China.",

She'll be serving on the bench as a woman's challenge to the state's two abortion bans makes its way through state courts.",
      "Partisan judicial elections, however, tend to track with other partisan election results, according to Keith of the Brennan Center. So some state legislatures have sought to turn nonpartisan state supreme court elections into fully partisan affairs.",
      "In Ohio, Republicans have won every state Supreme Court seat since lawmakers passed a bill in 2021 requiring party affiliation to appear on the ballot for those races. That includes three seats up for grabs in November that solidified the Republican majority on the court from 4-3 to 6-1.",
      "\"These justices who got elected in 2024 have been pretty open about being anti-abortion,\" said Jessie Hill, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, who has been litigating a challenge to Ohio's abortion restrictions since voters added protections to the state constitution in 2023.",
      "Until the recent ballot measure vote in Montana, the only obstacle blocking Republican-passed abortion restrictions from taking effect had been a nearly 26-year-old decision that determined Montana's right to privacy extends to abortion.",
      "Nelson, the former justice who was the lead author of the decision, said the court has since gradually leaned more conservative. He noted the state's other incoming justice, Katherine Bidegaray, was backed by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\"The dynamic of the court is going to change,\" Nelson said after the election. \"But the chief justice has one vote, just like everybody else.\"",
      "Swanson, Montana's new chief justice, had said throughout his campaign that he'll make decisions case by case. He also rebuked his opponent, Jerry Lynch, for saying he'd respect the court's ruling that protected abortion. Swanson called such statements a signal to liberal groups.",
      "At least eight cases are pending in Montana courts challenging state laws to restrict abortion access. Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, said that the new constitutional language, which takes effect in July, could further strengthen those cases but that the court's election outcome leaves room for uncertainty.",
      "The state's two outgoing justices had past ties to the Democratic Party. Fuller said they also consistently supported abortion as a right to privacy. \"One of those folks is replaced by somebody who we don't know will uphold that,\" she said. \"There will be this period where we're trying to see where the different justices fall on these issues.\"",
      "Those cases likely won't end the abortion debate in Montana.",
      "As of the legislative session's start in early January, Republican lawmakers, who have for years called the state Supreme Court liberal, had already proposed eight bills regarding abortion and dozens of others aimed at reshaping judicial power. Among them is a bill to make judicial elections partisan.",
      "Montana Sen. Daniel Emrich, a Republican who requested a bill titled \"Prohibit dismembering of person and provide definition of human,\" said it's too early to know which restrictions anti-abortion lawmakers will push hardest.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 19:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed David Weiss to be special counsel, giving him expanded powers to continue his investigation of Hunter Biden.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Monday released the final report of special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor elevated to special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of President Biden.",
      "In the report, which Garland submitted to Congress on Monday, Weiss wrote that he stood by his decisions to prosecute the president's son on tax and gun charges after agreements with Hunter's legal team collapsed. And Weiss pushed back on Mr. Biden's criticism of the probe.",
      "Weiss led a yearslong investigation into Hunter Biden that ultimately led to a jury conviction on felony gun charges in Delaware federal court and a guilty plea to tax evasion charges in California. In December, the president pardoned his son and claimed the charges against Hunter Biden were \"raw politics,\" a comment that was met with bipartisan criticism.",
      "\"The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith,\" Weiss wrote in his report. \"The President's characterizations are incorrect based on the facts in this case, and, on a more fundamental level, they are wrong.\"",
      "\"Calling those rulings into question and injecting partisanship into the independent administration of the law undermines the very foundation of what makes America's justice system fair and equitable,\" Weiss wrote. \"It erodes public confidence in an institution that is essential to preserving the rule of law.\"",
      "In the report, Weiss defended his charging decisions, which many Republicans in Congress alleged favored the president's son.",
      "\"I concluded that the Principles of Federal Prosecution were satisfied as to both the tax offenses and the gun offenses,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "In 2023, Hunter Biden was charged with lying on a gun application about his drug use and in a separate case, he faced three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses, including failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "Prosecutors alleged he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "\"Not only were both cases proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but they resulted in a verdict lawfully rendered by a jury and an admission of guilt. In making my decisions, I remained impervious to political influence at all times,\" Weiss wrote.",
      "During the special counsel's probe, IRS agents who worked on the Hunter Biden tax case with Weiss' team came forward in an interview with CBS News to raise questions about what they alleged was special treatment in the probe of the president's son. The said that dating back to the Trump administration, they had repeatedly been prevented from taking steps in the IRS investigation that would have been considered routine in other cases.",
      "\"We have to make sure as a special agent for IRS Criminal Investigation that we treat every single person exactly the same,\" Gary Shapley, a 14-year veteran of the agency, told CBS News at the time. \"And that just simply didn't happen here.\"",
      "The Justice Department and Weiss denied that Hunter Biden received favorable treatment.",
      "In a letter to Garland included in the report, Hunter Biden's legal team pointed out its criticism of the probe and told the attorney general, \"you likely are aware of the arguments we have made about the initiation and conduct of the prosecutions against our client.\"",
      "\"These are not 'inconsequential' or 'technical' tax code violations,\" Weiss wrote. \"The prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.\"",
      "Answering criticism of the gun charges, Weiss argued, \"An analysis of Justice Department data from 2008 to 2017 shows that these charges are brought more frequently than over 90 percent of the other available firearm offenses.\"",
      "According to Garland's letter to Congress, Weiss submitted the report a few days ago, on Friday. The attorney general noted there had been no instances during the probe when Garland had to intervene because of policy violations.",
      "The report also detailed Weiss' investigation into a former FBI informant, Alexander Smirnov, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to lying to FBI agents and providing them a fake story about the Bidens. Smirnov was sentenced to six years in prison earlier this month.",

      "After launching more than 100 small payloads from California on Tuesday and two commercial moon landers from Florida early Wednesday, both atop Falcon 9 rockets, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship for a ground-shaking launch from the Texas Gulf Coast to kick off the program's seventh test flight.",

      "The New Glenn is scheduled for its own weather-delayed liftoff from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 1 a.m. EST, the opening of a three-hour launch window.",
      "Six hours later, space station astronauts Nick Hague and Starliner pilot Sunita Williams plan to venture outside the NASA lab complex for a six-and-a-half-hour spacewalk starting around 8 a.m. to carry out a variety of maintenance and upgrade tasks.",
      "That will set the stage for the Super Heavy-Starship launch from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility at 5 p.m. EST, weather permitting.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship is the most powerful rocket ever built, generating a staggering 16 million pounds of thrust at liftoff using 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. The New Glenn rocket, built by Bezos' space company Blue Origin, is not nearly as powerful, but it will compete head-to-head with SpaceX's industry-dominating Falcon 9-family rockets.",
      "Like the Falcon 9's first stage, the New Glenn booster is reusable, and Blue Origin will attempt to recover its first stage with touchdown on an offshore landing ship. The rocket's upper stage will continue into orbit where flight controllers will carry out a series of tests. Additional flights are planned later this year.",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship has a more ambitious agenda befitting its gargantuan size.",
      "As with the two most recent test flights, the first stage will boost the Starship upper stage out of the dense lower atmosphere before falling away and heading back to the launch site for recovery. The Starship, meanwhile, will continue to space on the power of six Raptor engines of its own.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For the third flight in a row, SpaceX planned an attempt to \"catch\" the Super Heavy first stage after it propelled the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, snagging it on the way down using giant mechanical arms known as chopsticks mounted on the launch tower.",
      "The first such catch  last October was successful, a spectacular sight to thousands of  cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later  was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to  sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending  booster into position.",
      "New sensors now have more robust shielding to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets.",
      "But the bulk of the upgrades being tested Thursday are built into what SpaceX calls a \"new generation\" Starship. Multiple systems have been modified to improve performance and to test systems needed for eventual stage recovery.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 20:01:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dropping hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant in a desperate effort to stop the flames.",
    "story": [
      "Aircraft battling fires raging through the Los Angeles area are dousing the area with more than water: Hundreds of thousands of gallons of hot-pink fire suppressant have been dropped ahead of the flames in a desperate effort to stop them before they destroy more neighborhoods.",
      "The deadly fires have displaced thousands of residents and destroyed more than 12,000 structures since they began last Tuesday, Jan. 7. Four major fires driven by strong Santa Ana winds have charred about 62 square miles, according to Cal Fire.",
      "Fire agencies say the suppressants \u2014 most often used to fight forest fires \u2014 are an invaluable tool. But what is in them and are they safe?",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "When are fire suppressants used?",
      "The fires are burning quickly through canyons and other rugged areas that are difficult for firefighters on the ground to reach, Cal Fire said.",
      "While fire suppressants can be very effective, they do have limitations, the agency said. Strong winds can make it too dangerous to fly at the low altitudes needed for drops and can dissipate the retardant before it hits the ground.",
      "Besides Cal Fire, multiple agencies have dropped fire retardant and water, including the U.S. Forest Service, the Los Angeles and Ventura county fire departments, the city and the National Guard.",
      "What is in aerial fire suppressants?",
      "Aerial fire suppressants are generally a mixture of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 essentially fertilizer \u2014 and iron oxide, which is added to make the retardant visible, said Daniel McCurry, a civil and environmental engineering professor at the University of Southern California.",
      "The Forest Service, which has used 13 aircraft to dump suppressants on the Los Angeles fires, says they help starve a fire of oxygen and slow the rate of burn by cooling and coating vegetation and other surfaces.",
      "Perimeter, the company that supplies fire retardant to the Forest Service and other agencies, says the phosphate changes the way cellulose in plants decomposes and makes them non-flammable.",
      "The fire suppressants are generally considered safe for people, but many worry about their potential effects on wildlife.",
      "The Forest Service bans use of aerial suppressants over waterways and endangered species habitats, \"except when human life or public safety are threatened,\" due to potential health effects on fish and other wildlife.",
      "McCurry, from USC, said he and other researchers tested several suppressants and found heavy metals, including chromium and cadmium, in one commonly used by the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "McCurry said the study's findings suggest that it's \"plausible\" that fire suppressants could contribute to spikes of chromium and other heavy metals in waterways downstream of wildfires.",
      "\"We don't quite have a smoking gun yet because it's difficult, although not impossible, to prove where a heavy metal came from,\" McCurry said. \"We're working on that.\"",
      "Perimeter, the manufacturer of the Forest Service's fire retardant, said McCurry's research was on a formulation that wasn't used in California and is no longer used by the Forest Service. The company also says it doesn't add metals, which it says are naturally present in all ammonium phosphate fertilizers, and that its aerial suppressants \"are exhaustively tested by the USDA Forest Service and meet or exceed all health and safety standards.\"",
      "Using flame retardants to protect the power grid",
      "Several Los Angeles area power companies are also using flame retardants to try to help protect power poles and lines, CBS Los Angeles reported.",
      "Crews have been working for days, stopping at as many power poles as possible along the edges of the wildfires \u2014the Palisades Fire along the Los Angeles coast and the Eaton Fire in the mountains above Pasadena and Altadena.",
      "First, they clear dry shrubbery from the area surrounding the poles, then they use their trucks to douse each power pole with fire retardant \u2014 the same substance that's dropped by firefighting aircraft from above. They try to spray it as far up the pole as possible and into all the cracks, so embers can't get a foothold.",
      "\"That way, if or when the fire does make it this way, we don't have to worry about embers catching it,\" said Connor Norton, one of the PG&E employees working in North Hollywood on Sunday.",
      "\"The best way to save lives\"",
      "The use of fire retardants is imperative to putting out wildfires that expose millions of people to health risks, including from a toxic mix of microscopic particles that can cause breathing and heart problems by penetrating deep into the lungs and bloodstream.",
      "Studies have shown that wildfire smoke accounted for up to half of all health-damaging particle air pollution in the western U.S. in recent years as warming temperatures fueled more destructive blazes.",
      "And research released last year by the Alzheimer's Association found that wildfire smoke may be worse for brain health than other types of air pollution, raising the risk of dementia.",
      "\"The use of wildland fire retardant is the best way to save lives, protect communities and keep fires small,\" said Edward Goldberg, vice chairman of solutions at Perimeter.",
      "McCurry, the USC researcher, said more study is needed on fire suppressants \u2014 including in Los Angeles once the fires are out \u2014 but he understands their value: \"If there was a brush fire coming for my house, I'd still rather than paint a lot of (fire retardant) in front of it.\"",

      "Though it's not known exactly when they will show up in 2025, they typically appear in May and last through June. During those weeks, the cicadas mature, mate and lay eggs before dying off, and then their offspring begin the cycle anew.",
      "Climate change is also affecting the timing of the insects' arrival. Last year, the cicadas' return started in Georgia nearly two weeks ahead of schedule.",

      "With the nearly full moon shining overhead, two companies, one American and the other headquartered in Japan, launched privately developed robotic lunar landers early Wednesday, sharing a sky-lighting ride to space atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "The U.S. lander, built by Austin, Texas-based Firefly Aerospace and known as \"Blue Ghost,\" is carrying 10 sophisticated instruments for NASA while the Japanese spacecraft, built by Tokyo-based ispace and known as \"Resilience,\" is carrying four instruments of its own and a small microrover known as \"Tenacious.\"",
      "Mounted one atop the other in the nose cone of the Falcon 9, liftoff from historic pad 39A came on time at 1:11 a.m. EST Wednesday. Blue Ghost, weighing 1,033 pounds without propellant, was released to fly on its own one hour and five minutes after liftoff.",
      "Resilience, which weighs about 750 pounds, was deployed 21 minutes later, after the Falcon 9 carried out a final second stage engine firing to put the craft on a different trajectory.",
      "\"Our customers have different strategies for arriving to the moon, and Falcon 9's abilities enable us to deliver each lander to their respective injection orbits to complete their missions,\" said Julianna Scheiman, a senior SpaceX manager.",
      "The landers are taking very different routes to the moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend about 25 days in Earth orbit, giving Firefly engineers time to thoroughly check out the craft's instruments, propulsion and other subsystems. The craft then will fire its engines for a four-day trip to the moon, followed by 16 days in lunar orbit.",
      "If no major problems develop, Blue Ghost, 6.6 feet tall and 11.5 feet wide, then will descend to the surface near the center of Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crisis \u2014 touching down on four shock-absorbing legs. Its 10 science instruments will have two full weeks, or a lunar \"day,\" to collect data.",
      "\"The research we gather will help unlock future space exploration, while also benefiting life on Earth, with new insights into how space weather and other cosmic forces affect our planet,\" said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",
      "\"Each milestone we complete will provide valuable data for future missions and ultimately keep the United States and our international partners at the forefront of space exploration.\"",
      "Unlike Blue Ghost, ispace's Resilience, also known as Hakuto-R, will head for the moon about two days after launch, using a low-energy fuel-saving trajectory. One month later, the craft will fly past the moon, using its gravity to adjust the flight path before entering orbit about four months after launch. Two weeks after that, Resilience will attempt its own landing at Mare Frigoris, the Sea of Cold.",
      "ispace launched its first Hakuto lander in late 2022, but flight controllers lost contact the following March as the spacecraft was nearing the moon's surface.",
      "Investigators later determined the onboard software misinterpreted the lander's altitude after flying over the rim of a crater. The vehicle subsequently ran out of propellant and crashed to the surface.",
      "That problem has been corrected, ispace says, prompting the company to name its second Hakuto lander \"Resilience.\" ispace officials are optimistic about its chances the second time around.",

      "A model of a Swedish house will be carried away from the lander on the rover, which will \"set it down on the lunar surface,\" Garan said. \"We're going to photograph it, and it's a really exciting artistic endeavor as well.\"",
      "Garan called the microrover, built by ispace's Luxembourg-based unit and measuring just 10.2 inches tall and 21.6 inches long, \"really critical to the future of our company.\"",
      "\"The data that's going to come off the rover is going to be really valuable to us as we continue to hone our design on the surface mobility aspect of the business,\" he said. \"And so, that's really exciting, too.\"",
      "The Resilience mission is privately funded, without any financing from NASA. The instruments aboard Blue Ghost, in contrast, cost NASA $44 million to develop. The agency agreed to pay Firefly $101 million to carry them to the moon as part of its\u00a0Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program is aimed at encouraging private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"NASA is investing in commercial delivery services to the moon to enable industry growth and to support long-term lunar exploration, helping the United States stay ahead in space innovation,\" said Nicola Fox, head of NASA's science mission directorate.",
      "\"To date, five vendors have been awarded 11 lunar deliveries under CLPS and are sending more than 50 instruments to various locations on the moon, including the lunar South Pole. Existing CLPS contracts (have) a cumulative maximum contract value of $2.6 billion through 2028. No other nation has done this.\"",
      "The Blue Ghost instruments will collect data on the lunar dust environment, drill into the soil below the lander, monitor background X-ray emissions, test whether Earth-orbiting navigation satellites can be used near the moon and the effectiveness of computer radiation shielding, among other topics of interest.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Fox.",
      "\"The technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost mission will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments and most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Kim said the Blue Ghost mission will span about two months.",
      "\"After Blue Ghost lands on the moon, we'll be collecting critical payload science data throughout the entire mission,\" he said. \"We'll then wrap up the mission by capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset in high definition video before operating several hours into the lunar night.\"",
      "Toward the end of the mission, the company hopes to capture a phenomenon first seen by NASA's Surveyor moon landers and at least two Apollo crews, a so-called \"horizon glow\" caused by sunlight interacting with small dust particles kicked up by solar radiation and micrometeoroid impacts.",
      "\"Knowing that Firefly's Blue Ghost mission is a culmination of what the last Apollo astronaut to walk on the moon observed is a fitting tribute to their legacy,\" Kim said.",

      "Update: Monday's planned launch was postponed due to technical issues. Read more here.",
      "Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin readied the company's powerful New Glenn rocket for its delayed but long-awaited maiden flight early Monday, kicking off a high-stakes bid to compete head-to-head with Elon Musk's SpaceX and its industry dominating Falcon family of rockets.",
      "While more than one successful test flight will be needed to demonstrate the reliability needed for launches of costly NASA probes, high-priority national security payloads and other commercial spacecraft, the New Glenn, nearly 10 years after Bezos announced the project, is expected to be a viable alternative.",
      "Mounted atop pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, the 321-foot-tall rocket is scheduled for blast off at 1 a.m. EST Monday, the opening of a three-hour window. Blue Origin had hoped to launch the rocket Friday, then Sunday, but both opportunities were ruled out due to rough seas in the booster landing zone.",

      "From launch to touchdown: nine minutes and 28 seconds. While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin is making the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. Appropriately enough, the company named the booster \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "While the 23-foot-wide first stage is powered by liquified natural gas, the 88-foot-tall upper stage is equipped with two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines that generate a combined 320,000 pounds of thrust. They can be restarted in space up to three times over 16 hours, enabling the stage to place payloads in especially demanding orbits.",
      "The New Glenn's carbon-composite nose fairing, which encapsulates payloads during the climb to space, provides 16,184 cubic feet of volume, large enough to house an entire New Shepard rocket, the booster Blue Origin uses to launch space tourists\u00a0on sub-orbital flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "For its maiden flight, the New Glenn will carry a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as Blue Ring, a sort of space tug that can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing onboard computer support and even servicing.",
      "The flight plan calls for the upper stage and the attached Blue Ring test vehicle to reach an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles. The mission is expected to last five hours and 50 minutes from start to finish.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet, with 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other payloads weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck. There are no such payloads on the initial \"pathfinder\" flight, but the spacecraft will be thoroughly checked out in orbit.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0later this month if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "Specifically, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok. If ByteDance had started the process to sell TikTok, the president also could push pause on adoption of the law for 90 days.",
      "On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk could buy TikTok's U.S. operations, effectively allowing the app to evade a ban. Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to ever sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "The Supreme Court on Jan. 11 heard arguments from government attorneys, who say TikTok poses a threat to U.S. national security, and from lawyers for the social media platform. Experts said the justices seemed receptive to the government's case, increasing the likelihood of a ban. Here's what that would mean for TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 17:00:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk claims the U.S. needs a pipeline of foreign employees working on H-1B visas because the country lacks skilled engineers. Here's what the data shows.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk sparked fierce online debate recently when the billionaire said on social media that the U.S. lacks enough top engineers, pointing to immigration as the solution to what he characterized as a dearth of technical expertise.",
      "\"There is a dire shortage of extremely talented and motivated engineers in America,\" Musk posted on his social media platform, X, comparing tech companies to a pro sports team scouting players. \"If you force the world's best talent to play for the other side, America will LOSE.\"",
      "The claims are at the center of a divide between supporters of President-elect Donald Trump, who tend to take a hard line against immigration, and technology entrepreneurs like Musk, who along with X runs exploration company SpaceX and electric vehicle maker Tesla, both of which employ many foreign workers hired with H-1B visas.",
      "Yet labor market data suggests that American tech workers aren't in short supply, and critics of the H-1B program say it displaces Americans in favor of foreign-born employees hired at lower salaries. Proponents of recruiting skilled workers from abroad say tech jobs aren't zero-sum, while hiring foreigners with specialized skills can spur innovation and ultimately create more jobs for U.S.-born workers.",
      "Data from the National Center for Education Statistics shows that the number of bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in computer science and in engineering conferred in the U.S. reached their highest levels in the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years since 1970-71.",
      "Meanwhile, tech and engineering jobs in the U.S. are expected to grow by 7% by 2033, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The share of the science and engineering workforce that is foreign-born has grown over the past three decades, according to the National Science Foundation, while STEM workers have experienced some of the highest employment rates of any occupation over the past five years.",
      "Companies with the most H-1B workers",
      "Tech companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B program, which is intended to allow highly skilled foreigners to work in the U.S. Amazon received the most H1-B visas of any company in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. Microsoft, Google and Meta were also in the top 10, while Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.",
      "More H-1Bs visas were granted to software developers last year than for any other position.",
      "\"The H-1B visa is like the Swiss Army knife of visas. It's used for a lot of different purposes,\" said John Skrentny, a sociology professor at U.C. San Diego who wrote a book on why STEM graduates choose careers outside of the fields they studied. \"If you hear people say that the H-1B visa is very important for attracting the best and brightest to the United States, they are correct. At the same time, the H-1B visa is used for cheap labor.\"",
      "Investigations including by 60 Minutes and The New York Times have found that some companies have laid off American workers and then replaced them with H-1B hires, sometimes even requiring displaced employees to train their replacements in order to receive their severance packages.",
      "Some of the roles H-1B workers are hired to fill also involve less complicated jobs, like product testing, said Ronil Hira, an associate political science professor at Howard University and a research associate with the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. These roles don't necessarily meet the visa program's intended goal of outsourcing roles that require unique skills.",
      "In addition to Big Tech companies, consulting firms like Cognizant, Tata and Infosys are also among the largest recipients of H-1B visas, providing tech companies with a steady pipeline of highly educated, well-trained employees willing to work on contract.",
      "These companies are incentivized to find employees that will accept lower pay, Hira said.",
      "\"Their business model is to resell labor. If you're reselling labor, the way you become competitive is by having lower labor costs.\"",
      "A boost to innovation?",
      "Still, evidence of the H-1B program's broader impact on employment in the U.S. is mixed. One\u00a0study from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics found that the average employer that receives H-1B visas isn't displacing American workers. The research firm found that while companies that received the visas initially did hire more foreign-born workers in response, they also typically experienced growing revenue and were eventually able to hire additional workers.",
      "The effects were greater for smaller employers that only applied for a few visas, the study showed.",
      "\"Most of our results are driven by smaller firms because they're the ones for whom the lottery really matters,\" said Parag Mahajan, one of the study's authors and an assistant economics professor at the University of Delaware. For those companies, he said, \"There is a lot of value to looking elsewhere for talent.\"",
      "Mahajan's study also found that for some companies, hiring a foreign worker on an H-1B visa eventually created jobs for American-born workers because the person's skills can help the company grow.",
      "But some economists, including Hira, take issue with the claim that foreign workers are needed to fill a nationwide shortage in talented engineers.",
      "When there's a shortage of workers for a particular role, wages in that sector rise, Hira said, the same way gas prices go up when oil supplies drop. But labor market data shows that wages in the tech industry have remained relatively stable.",
      "Median weekly earnings in computer and mathematics roles have grown by 0.27% from 2019 to 2023, after being adjusted for inflation, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows. In engineering and architecture roles, wages have declined by 3.53% over the same timeframe.",
      "More firing than hiring",
      "Tech companies have also laid off hundreds of employees in recent years while continuing to sponsor new H-1B visas. An analysis by the Economic Policy Institute found that the top 30 companies hiring the most H-1B workers hired 34,000 new H-1B employees in 2022 but laid off at least 85,000 workers that year and in early 2023.",
      "The layoffs mirror a decline in available jobs in the industry. Job postings in software development on Indeed.com are 67% of what they were in February 2020, according to the job board platform.",
      "How the debate around H-1Bs will translate to policy after Trump takes office is unclear.

    "published": "Mon, 13 Jan 2025 08:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposal is raising concerns with the chip industry, with artificial intelligence leader Nvidia calling it \"misguided.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that would limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, part of an effort to preserve America's six- to 18-month advantage on AI over rivals such as China.",
      "Proposed Monday, the framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict in 120 countries the chips used for data centers and AI products. Mexico, Portugal, Israel and Switzerland are among the nations that could have limited access.",
      "Chip giant Nvidia on Monday called\u00a0the proposal \"misguided,\" and said that it \"threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.\"",
      "On a call with reporters previewing the framework, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that it's \"critical\" to preserve America's leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips. The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.",
      "\"As AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense,\" Raimondo said. The framework \"is designed to safeguard the most advanced AI technology and ensure that it stays out of the hands of our foreign adversaries but also enabling the broad diffusion and sharing of the benefits with partner countries.\"",
      "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan stressed that the framework would ensure that the most cutting-edge aspects of AI would be developed within the United States and with its closest allies, instead of possibly getting offshored such as the battery and renewable energy sectors.",
      "Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve U.S. companies' advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains.",
      "AI-enhanced technology is forecast to help fuel growth and boost corporate productivity, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives calling the tech developments a \"once in a generation 4th Industrial Revolution\" in a recent research note.",
      "Risks to AI leadership?",
      "A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put U.S. companies at a disadvantage.",
      "\"While we share the U.S. government's commitment to national and economic security, the rule's potential risks to U.S. global leadership in AI cannot be emphasized enough,\" said a statement from Naomi Wilson, the group's senior vice president for Asia and global trade policy. She called for a more extensive consultation with the tech industry.",
      "One industry executive, who is familiar with the framework and insisted on anonymity to discuss it, said the proposed restrictions would limit access to chips already used for video games, despite claims made otherwise by the government. The executive said it would also limit which companies could build data centers abroad.",
      "Nvidia bashes proposal",
      "Because the framework includes a 120-day comment period, the incoming Republican administration of President-elect Donald Trump could ultimately determine the rules for the sales abroad of advanced computer chips. This sets up a scenario in which Trump will have to balance economic interests with the need to keep the United States and its allies safe.",
      "Ned Finkle, vice president of external affairs at Nvidia, said in a statement that the prior Trump administration had helped create the foundation for AI's development and that the proposed framework would hurt innovation without achieving the stated national security goals.",
      "\"While cloaked in the guise of an 'anti-China' measure, these rules would do nothing to enhance U.S. security,\" he said. \"The new rules would control technology worldwide, including technology that is already widely available in mainstream gaming PCs and consumer hardware.\"",
      "Under the framework, roughly 20 key allies and partners would face no restrictions on accessing chips, but other countries would face caps on the chips they could import, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.",
      "Nations without restrictions",
      "The allies without restrictions include Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Republic of Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.",
      "Users outside of these close allies could purchase up to 50,000 graphics processing units per country. There would also be government-to-government deals which could bump up the cap to 100,000 if their renewable energy and technological security goals are aligned with the U.S.",
      "Institutions in certain countries could also apply for a legal status that would let them purchase up to 320,000 advanced graphics processing units over two years. Still, there would be limits as to how much AI computational capacity could be placed abroad by companies and other institutions.",
      "Also, computer chip orders equivalent to 1,700 advanced graphics processing units would not need a license to import or count against the national chip cap, among the other standards set by the framework. The exception for the 1,700 graphics processing units would likely help to meet the orders for universities and medical institutions, as opposed to data centers.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Zuckerberg set the internet abuzz this week when the Meta CEO announced that the tech giant would no longer conduct independent fact-checking. The program, implemented in 2016, will be replaced with Meta's own version of Community Notes, a crowdsourced approach to reviewing online content employed by\u00a0 X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.",
      "So what exactly is Community Notes, and how does it work?",
      "How Community Notes works",
      "Meta hasn't released specifics about how it will empower users of Facebook, Instagram and other social platforms to monitor content, said Melissa Mahtani, executive producer at CBS News Confirmed.",
      "On X, Community Notes works by leaving fact-checking up to the community. Approved contributors call out content deemed false or misleading by attaching notes providing more context. Here's an example of a community note provided by X on its site:",
      "Becoming an approved contributor on X \"doesn't take much,\" Mahtani said. Any X user with an active phone number and who's been on the platform for at least six months with no violations is qualified to volunteer to be a contributor, she said. Contributors are protected by anonymity.",
      "When a post is deemed false or misleading by an approved contributor, the person will post a note that provides users with additional context. The note appears beneath the original post.",
      "Once a note is added by an approved contributor, it is still not visible to regular users on X. Before that happens, other approved contributors must vote on whether the note is helpful. This is where \"things get tricky\" said Mahtani.",
      "Is the note helpful?",
      "Once a note is added to a post on X, other approved contributors rate it on its utility.",
      "Explained Mahtani, \"Other contributors need to take a look at the sourcing, the accuracy of that note, and vote on whether or not it's helpful. If they vote that it's helpful \u2014 this is the tricky part \u2014 the company says that an algorithm takes a look at the ideological spectrum of all those contributors who voted. If they deem that those voters are diverse, it gets published.\"",
      "The algorithm decides",
      "According to X's website, the purpose of its so-called\u00a0bridging-based algorithm\u00a0is to \"identify notes that are helpful to a broad audience across perspectives.\"",
      "In other words, if the algorithm finds that contributors who voted on a given note represent an ideologically diverse group, then the note becomes visible on the platform. But if the algorithm finds that the voting contributors are too uniform in their political views \u2014 a possible sign of bias \u2014 \"the public never sees it,\" Mahtani said.",
      "Problems with X's system of crowd-based fact-checking arise when a valid note calling out misinformation isn't rated as helpful by a diverse enough group of contributors to satisfy the algorithm, and is therefore never seen by readers. The speed at which a note is made public is also important, so that false or misleading information isn't given the opportunity to spread unchallenged.",
      "A report in October\u00a0by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate analyzed the Community Notes feature and found that accurate notes correcting false and misleading claims about the U.S. elections were not displayed on 209 out of a sample of 283 posts deemed misleading \u2014 or 74%.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments Friday morning on whether to overturn or delay a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok in the U.S. in the coming days.",
      "The law is set to take effect on Jan. 19, nine months after it swiftly passed Congress with bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Biden. It requires the widely popular app to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. The law also gives the president the ability to grant a 90-day delay in its implementation if a sale is in progress.",
      "The case pits the First Amendment's right to free speech against what the federal government and lawmakers say are threats to national security posed by TikTok. The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed in considering the case, agreeing to take up the dispute just two days after lawyers for the platform sought its intervention on an emergency basis.",
      "The question before the court is whether the law targeting TikTok violates the First Amendment. Here's what to know about the case:",
      "The law at the center of the case",
      "The legal battle arose from a law passed by Congress as part of a foreign aid package in April. Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the measure makes it unlawful for third-party service providers like Google or Apple to \"distribute, maintain or update\" an app controlled by a foreign adversary by providing certain services, such as offering it in app stores.",
      "Under the law, any app operated by ByteDance, TikTok, or its subsidiaries is considered a \"foreign adversary controlled application.\" The designation also covers apps operated by a \"covered company\" controlled by a foreign adversary \u2014 China, Russia, North Korea or Iran.",
      "The prohibitions are set to take effect 270 days after the law was enacted, on Jan. 19. Under the law, TikTok can remain available, however, if it divests from ByteDance. The measure also allows the president to grant a single, 90-day extension if a sale is underway.",
      "What are the arguments?",
      "In a brief laying out its arguments to the Supreme Court, the U.S. government said the vast amount of information TikTok collects on its users could be wielded by the Chinese government for \"espionage or blackmail\" purposes or to \"advance its geopolitical interests\" by \"sowing discord and disinformation during a crisis.\"",
      "\"In response to those grave national-security threats, Congress did not impose any restriction on speech, much less one based on viewpoint or content. Instead, Congress restricted only foreign adversary control: TikTok may continue operating in the United States and presenting the same content from the same users in the same manner if its current owner executes a divestiture that frees the platform from the [People's Republic of China's] control,\" the Justice Department said.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok have argued that shuttering the app in the U.S. will silence not only its speech, but also that of the 170 million Americans who regularly use it. In its filing, lawyers for the platform called the potential shutdown \"unprecedented\" and said the government's justification is \"at war with the First Amendment.\"",
      "Additionally, TikTok has argued that divesture from ByteDance is not possible, and the parent company said in April that it will not sell the platform.",
      "A group of eight TikTok users also challenged the law on First Amendment grounds and have argued that outlawing the platform will deprive them of access to a \"vital communications forum,\" through which they can earn a living and spread ideas.",
      "The legislation, lawyers for the creators wrote in a filing with the court, \"violates the First Amendment because it suppresses the speech of American creators based primarily on an asserted government interest \u2014 policing the ideas Americans hear \u2014 that is anathema to our nation's history and tradition and irreconcilable with this court's precedents.\"",
      "But an appeals court disagreed with TikTok and the users' First Amendment claims. In a December ruling, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was sympathetic to the government's argument that TikTok poses a national security risk. The appeals court later rejected TikTok's bid for a temporary pause on the ban while it sought the Supreme Court's review.",
      "Thomas Berry, an expert in constitutional law at the Cato Institute, said it would be \"unprecedented\" for the Supreme Court to uphold a law that restricts such a popular and widely used platform in the U.S., but said its reasoning if it sides with the government is significant.",
      "\"If the court relies on notions of disinformation or content manipulation as a justification, that would be extremely harmful to the First Amendment doctrine because it would essentially give a greenlight to the government targeting a speech platform for the content it carries,\" he said. Berry filed a friend-of-the-court brief in support of TikTok and the users.",
      "But if the court upholds the law based on the data collection concerns, he said \"that would still be unfortunate deference shown to government arguments that haven't been backed up by a public record, but that would potentially be more of a good-for-this-case-only type of ruling.\"",
      "Additionally, Berry said the impact of a ban on users is an important perspective for the court to consider.",
      "\"It humanizes the speech happening on this platform and emphasizes, especially to justices who might not be familiar with it, that this isn't just speech being broadcast in from foreign countries,\" he said. \"This is primarily Americans speaking to other Americans, and lots of totally apolitical speech is happening and being found through the TikTok discovery algorithm.\"",
      "Jennifer Safstrom, who directs the Stanton Foundation First Amendment Clinic at Vanderbilt Law School, said TikTok may have more of an uphill battle in making its case because \"one of the strengths of the government's position is that the executive and legislative branches are given a lot of deference with respect to national security.\"",
      "\"So there's often a hesitancy for courts to second-guess the political branches on those kinds of national security questions,\" Safstrom told CBS News.",
      "Patrick Toomey, the deputy director of ACLU's National Security Project, said the government has not supported its claims against TikTok with concrete public evidence. The ACLU has urged the Supreme Court to block the ban in a friend-of-the-court brief.",
      "\"The government can't impose this type of total ban unless it's the only way to prevent extremely serious and imminent harm to national security,\" Toomey told CBS News. \"That means not just gesturing at the possibility that these types of harms could come from exploitation of TikTok, but providing evidence that either those harms are ongoing and widespread or are imminent, and we haven't seen that kind of evidence.\"",
      "Trump opposes TikTok ban",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing the case in the final days of the Biden administration. President-elect Donald Trump, who in recent months has expressed support for TikTok, takes office a day after the law is set to go into effect.",
      "A lawyer for Trump filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking the Supreme Court to pause the law's implementation, saying the incoming president opposes banning TikTok at this time and wants the ability to resolve the dispute through \"political means.\"",
      "\"President Trump takes no position on the merits of the dispute. Instead, he urges the Court to stay the statute's effective date to allow his incoming Administration to pursue a negotiated resolution that could prevent a nationwide shutdown of TikTok, thus preserving the First Amendment rights of tens of millions of Americans, while also addressing the government's national security concerns,\" Trump's attorney D. John Sauer wrote.",
      "The president-elect intends to nominate Sauer for solicitor general in his second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Sauer will argue on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump recently met with TikTok's chief executive at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and has praised the platform for helping him win over younger voters in the November election.",
      "The president-elect's support for the widely popular app is an about-face from his first term in office. In August 2021, he took unilateral action that would have effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. after finding that its data collection posed a risk that China would use Americans' data for malign purposes. The ban, however, never took effect after it was blocked by a federal court and the executive order rescinded by Mr. Biden.",
      "Though Trump is pushing for a delay, members of his incoming administration have firmly backed restricting TikTok, including his nominee to be secretary of state, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and his national security adviser pick, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida.",
      "Leaders of the House China Committee and Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky also submitted friend-of-the-court briefs to the Supreme Court, both arguing that the law should be upheld.",
      "Lawmakers and intelligence agencies have long had suspicions about the app's ties to China and have argued that the concerns are warranted because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "In response to the national security concerns, Congress prohibited TikTok on federal government devices in 2022, and a majority of states have barred the app on state government devices.",
      "TikTok has argued that several issues would arise if the platform is forced to cut all ties to ByteDance. Because the Chinese government is opposed to selling the algorithm that tailors video recommendations to each user, a new buyer would have to rebuild it from scratch. The platform would also become a \"content island\" in the U.S. \u2014 if it cannot share data with ByteDance, \"American users would be unable to access global content, and American creators would be unable to reach global audiences,\" its lawyers said.",
      "How TikTok could avoid a ban",
      "Still, TikTok has several pathways to avoid a ban outside of Supreme Court intervention, experts told CBS News.",
      "Trump could take action once he's in office and ask the Justice Department not to enforce the law or prosecute tech companies, like Apple and Google, who host TikTok in their app stores. Trump also has the authority to issue a 90-day delay of the law after Jan. 19, though he would have to certify to Congress that \"evidence of significant progress\" toward a divestiture has taken place.",
      "TikTok won't disappear from Americans' phones on Jan. 19 if the law takes effect. However, users would not be able to update the app and those who don't already have it would not be able to download it.",

      "The federal government is withdrawing a proposal that would\u00a0require more ships to slow down\u00a0in East Coast waters to try to save a vanishing species of whale, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The move in the waning days of the Biden administration will leave the endangered North Atlantic right whale vulnerable to extinction as the Trump administration is signaling a shift from environmental conservation to support for marine industries, conservation groups said. But federal authorities said there's no way to implement the rules before\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u00a0takes office on Monday.",
      "The new vessel speed rules proposed by the National Marine Fisheries Service more than two years ago have been the topic of much debate among shippers, commercial fishermen and wildlife conservationists, who all have a stake in the whale's fate. The whale, which is vulnerable to collisions with ships, numbers less than 380 and\u00a0its population has plummeted\u00a0in recent years.",
      "The Trump administration is likely to be less enthusiastic about new restrictions on shipping, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "\"While we've been waiting and watching the proposed rule move forward, and ultimately stall, we've watched on the water outcomes of the current insufficient protections,\" Brogan said. \"And we've watched whales be killed by speeding boats.\"",
      "Thousands of public comments",
      "The proposed rules would have expanded slow zones off the East Coast as well as the size classes of boats and ships that must slow down.",
      "The fisheries service received about 90,000 public comments about them, according to documents set to be published in the Federal Register on Thursday. The filing says the service \"does not have sufficient time to finalize this regulation in this administration due to the scope and volume of public comments.\"",
      "The final rule to modify North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations had been with the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which reviews new regulations before they are implemented, said Katherine Silverstein, a spokesperson for the National Marine Fisheries Service. She confirmed the fisheries service withdrew the rule on Wednesday.",
      "Conservation groups have\u00a0long argued that\u00a0tighter ship speed rules are necessary to protect the whales, in part because warm ocean waters appear to be causing the animals to stray from protected zones. The federal government first announced the proposal in summer 2022 and a coalition of environmental groups\u00a0sued to try to speed up\u00a0the finalization of the rules last year.",
      "Some shippers, however, have argued that the rules could be economically devastating to boating and shipping industries.",
      "\"This is a huge step forward for American boat manufacturers, coastal economies, and outdoor enthusiasts across the U.S.,\" said Frank Hugelmeyer, president and CEO of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the largest trade association in North America for the recreational boating industry. \"The way this rule was drafted gave rulemaking a bad name and created an entirely preventable dynamic.\"",
      "What to know about North Atlantic right whales",
      "Right whales are massive creatures that grow to be between 45 and 52 feet in length. Adults can weigh up to 70 tons, according to NOAA. They're identified by signature white calluses on the head.",
      "They were once numerous off the East Coast, but their numbers were devastated during the commercial whaling era. They have been a protected species for many years but have been slow to recover.",
      "The whales migrate from their calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. The journey has become increasingly perilous as the tiny organisms they eat seek colder waters, causing the whales to leave established protected areas, scientists have said.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists were concerned after seeing nearly a quarter of the world's population of the critically endangered North Atlantic\u00a0right whales\u00a0in an unusual and potentially dangerous spot for them, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "The New England Aquarium said at least 82 whales were observed in late July and August during research flights south of New York's Long Island \u2014 hundreds of miles away from\u00a0New England\u00a0and Canadian waters where they are typically seen in the summer.",
      "Aquarium scientist Katherine McKenna told the station that scientists didn't know for sure why the whales were in that area, but they seemed to be following food.",

      "Given the mixed inflation data, some economists predicted the Fed is likely to hold off on a rate hike at its Jan. 29 meeting, although they added that the improvement in the core CPI bolsters the possibility of cuts later in 2025.",

      "\"Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States,\" he added. \"I have given my heart and my soul to our nation.

    "story": [
      "As disasters linked to climate change become more frequent in the U.S., homeowners across the country are paying the price through skyrocketing insurance costs \u2014 and not only in states like Florida and California that are considered most vulnerable to global warming.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires, which have decimated neighborhoods such as Pacific Palisades and Altadena, are focusing attention on a mounting insurance crisis that is particularly acute in states at greatest risk of wildfires, such as California, Colorado, Texas and Oregon. But the problem is reaching into almost every region of the U.S., including the Midwest, the Northeast and the Mountain states, according to analyses of insurance data.",
      "Research shows that climate change is heightening the conditions that lead to fire-conducive weather, including drying out vegetation and constraining water supplies. Such conditions are in turn prolonging wildfire season as well magnifying the size and intensity of blazes.",
      "\"Serious pocketbook issue\"",
      "The average homeowners insurance premium jumped 33% from 2020 to 2023, rising from $1,902 per year to $2,530, according to 2024\u00a0research\u00a0from economists at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of Wisconsin. By comparison, inflation rose about 18% during that same time period.",
      "Such costs have surged even more in parts of the U.S. prone to the kind of natural disasters that experts link to climate change. Homeowners in these states have seen their insurance premiums soar by about 50% over that three-year period, according to Benjamin Keys, a professor real estate and finance at Wharton and a co-author of the 2024 study.",
      "Yet even property owners in states considered less vulnerable to climate disasters are now grappling with increased insurance costs and dropped policies \u2014 issues that threaten to undermine property values.",
      "\"We're seeing it now for five years in a row \u2014 the increases in insurance costs \u2014 and they are correlated with increased severity of climate events,\" Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications research at First Street, a non-profit research firm that models climate risks, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One thing that is surprising is that Kansas and Nebraska and theses places in the middle of the country are also seeing these huge increases in insurance.\"",
      "While the average U.S. homeowners insurance cost is now about $2,300 per year, Nebraskans pay an average of $5,700, while Oklahomans are shelling out about $4,800 annually \u2014 not far from Florida's $5,500 average annual rate, Bankrate data shows.",
      "Insurers are responding to the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, hurricanes and flooding by hiking premiums to recoup their payouts, researchers have found. In 2000, homeowners' insurance costs represented about 7.5% of the typical mortgage; that figure had soared to 22% as of 2023, according to First Street's research.",
      "\"That is a serious pocketbook issue,\" said Wharton's Keys in a Jan. 10 webcast to discuss the Los Angeles wildfires and insurance, about the rise in policy premiums. \"That is the kind of thing that gets you around the kitchen table and say, do we need to move?\"",
      "Dropped policies from coast to coast",
      "In some cases, homeowners aren't only facing higher insurance costs, but also difficulties in even securing coverage.",
      "Non-renewal rates have climbed sharply in California and Florida, where the so-called insurer of last resort \u2014 the states' Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, or FAIR, plans \u2014 has seen a jump in enrollment. Thousands of homeowners in Los Angeles were dropped by their insurers last year, just months before the wildfires hit.",
      "\"It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer,\" Jeff Cohen, whose Altadena, California, home was burned in this month's fires, told CBS News about being dropped by his insurer prior to the disaster. He and his wife eventually found pricier coverage through the state's FAIR Plan.",
      "But it's not only homeowners in states like California, Florida and Louisiana who are getting dropped by their insurers, according to a Senate Budget Committee report published last month. While most of the top 10 states for non-renewals by insurers were either coastal states or those prone to wildfire, Oklahoma also ranked high, likely due to \"increasing winds and hail from severe convective storms,\" the report found.",
      "The next 15 states with rates of home coverage non-renewal include Midwestern states such as Nebraska and Ohio, as well as Mountain states including South Dakota and Montana, the analysis found. While non-renewal rates have more than tripled in Florida between 2018 to 203, Oklahoma isn't far behind, with the rate of dropped policies nearly doubling over that time, the data shows.",
      "\"With a more volatile atmosphere, there is more latent energy in the climate, and we end up with more intense thunderstorms that produce heavy precipitation,\" First Street's Porter noted. \"They are tied back to climate change, and the fact that the air temperatures are warmer and the sea is warmer, winds are impacted in a way that's more volatile.\"",
      "Heavy rains in Vermont that led to damaging\u00a0flooding in July 2024, as well as Hurricane Helene's devastation in parts of North Carolina last year, are illustrative of these more damaging weather events, Porter noted.",
      "\"Notably, the data make clear that insurance non-renewals are not only a problem for communities typically seen as being on the front lines of climate change,\" the Senate report said. \"Florida, California, and Louisiana have been seen as the canaries in the coal mine.\"",
      "The ressearchers added, \"[P]laces such as southern New England, parts of Montana, New Mexico, coastal and inland North Carolina, and South Carolina, among others, are not far behind.\"",
      "Property values at risk?",
      "Most Americans in the U.S. who own a home also have property insurance because such coverage is required by mortgage lenders, which mandate the policies to secure their investments against damage from theft or accidents like storms or falling trees.",
      "But as climate-related disasters proliferate, insurers are readjusting their risk models and boosting premiums to cover their need for increased capital reserves as well as to buy more reinsurance \u2014 basically, insurance provided to insurers by other carriers,\u00a0according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "As wildfires, hurricanes and other weather events become more intense due to human-caused climate change, it's likely that insurance access and affordability will also worsen, the Senate report predicted. In some extreme examples, property values could plummet if those areas become uninsurable, an issue that's already hit some communities vulnerable to wildfires and other weather disasters.",
      "U.S. homeowners burdened by heavy insurance costs are unlikely to see any relief anytime soon, according to experts.",
      "\"We're in the middle of insurance price corrections \u2014 they will continue until insurance companies are able to be profitable,\" Porter said. \"Really no matter where you are across the country, there is some climate hazard that you are exposed to.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 14:59:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Pam Bondi sought to allay the concerns of Democrats who said they feared Trump and his allies would use the Justice Department to target their political enemies.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. attorney general, vowed to end the \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, saying her focus will be on reducing crime and upholding the law.",
      "The former Florida attorney general, who represented Trump during his first impeachment, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday to testify about her nomination, which is all but certain to be approved in the GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "She spent much of the hearing seeking to allay concerns from skeptical Democrats that Trump would use the Justice Department to target his political enemies once in office.",
      "\"There will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\" Bondi said, adding that she believes prosecutors under President Biden unfairly targeted Trump for the last four years.",
      "\"I will fight every day to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice and each of its components,\" she said. \"The partisanship, the weaponization, will be gone. America will have one tier of justice for all.\"",
      "Democrats did not seem convinced, repeatedly pressing Bondi on whether she'd investigate and prosecute figures ranging from former Rep. Liz Cheney and former special counsel Jack Smith to journalists and Trump critics.",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, a role she held for two terms.",
      "\"If confirmed as the next attorney general of the United States, my overriding objective will be to return the Department of Justice to its core mission of keeping Americans safe and vigorously prosecuting criminals,\" Bondi said in her opening statement.",
      "Bondi said her time as a local prosecutor framed her goals for the Justice Department, which she described as \"getting back to the basics\" of combating crime and reducing recidivism.",
      "Republicans on the committee largely focused on Bondi's decades of crimefighting experience as a local prosecutor, and later as Florida attorney general. They claimed the Justice Department has been \"weaponized\" in recent years for political reasons, pointing to the prosecutions of Trump that have been dropped since the election.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the committee's top Democrat, noted Bondi's experience, but said it is Trump who has vowed to use the Justice Department to target his political enemies. Durbin said he wants assurances that Bondi would keep the Justice Department independent, and would be willing to say \"no\" to Trump. Trump clashed with his two attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, over decisions they made in his first term.",
      "Durbin asked Bondi if she accepted that Trump lost the election in 2020, a fact that he and many of his prominent supporters have not publicly acknowledged. Bondi stopped short of doing so Wednesday.",
      "\"There was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024,\" Bondi said. Bondi told Durbin that she \"accept[s] the results\" of the 2020 election but declined to say outright that Mr. Biden won.",
      "Durbin asked if Bondi would support pardons for people convicted for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Bondi said, if asked, she would review potential pardons on a \"case by case basis,\" adding: \"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, asked Bondi if she would \"be willing to resign if ordered to do something improper.\"",
      "\"Senator, I wouldn't work at a law firm, I wouldn't be a prosecutor, I wouldn't be attorney general if anyone asked me to do something improper and I felt I had to carry that out, of course I would not do that,\" Bondi said. \"That's one of the main things you learn as a young prosecutor, is to do the right thing.\"",
      "Later, she told Coons she and the president-elect have not discussed appointing a special prosecutor to investigate Mr. Biden \u2014 a threat Trump has made. Throughout the hearing, she argued she would keep the Justice Department independent from the White House, including by upholding a department policy limiting contacts with White House officials.",
      "Bondi was repeatedly pressed by Democrats about whether she would target perceived Trump foes, including Cheney and Smith, who led the dual federal investigations against Trump. During one particularly heated exchange, she declined to say if she knew of any factual predicate for investigating Cheney, and told California Sen. Adam Schiff his concerns are misplaced.",
      "\"You're all so worried about Liz Cheney, senator, you know what we should be worried about? The crime rate in California right now is through the roof,\" she said.",
      "Bondi was also asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, about the reauthorization of Section 702, a government intelligence collection tool that has come under fire from some Republicans in Congress. She said she would take a look at the issue and called Section 702 a \"very important tool.\"",
      "Bondi's nomination",
      "Bondi's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee was one of several taking place before GOP-led panels this week as Trump prepares to begin his second term in office. Republicans have indicated they plan to give substantial deference to Trump as he fills out the top ranks of his administration and are aiming to install key Cabinet officials to their posts soon after the president-elect is inaugurated Monday.",
      "Bondi spent the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing meeting with senators on Capitol Hill, and she is not expected to face significant hurdles in the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Durbin accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm and said he was concerned Bondi will prioritize fealty to Trump over loyalty to the Constitution. He met with Bondi last week.",
      "Bondi was term-limited in her position as Florida's attorney general and left office in 2019. While in office, she spearheaded lawsuits against the Obama administration, challenging the Affordable Care Act \u2014 known as Obamacare \u2014 and then-President Barack Obama's immigration policies.",
      "She went on to serve as an attorney and lobbyist at the firm Ballard Partners. There, she represented large corporations like General Motors, Amazon, Uber and the American Institute Against Human Trafficking, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit that tracks lobbying. And she submitted a registration with the federal government to lobby on behalf of Qatar \"regarding Qatari relations with U.S. government officials, U.S. business entities, and non-governmental audiences, in dealing with matters pertaining to combating human trafficking.\"",
      "At her hearing on Wednesday, Bondi said she was \"very proud of the work that I did\" with Qatar, telling Durbin her work was focused on \"anti-human trafficking efforts related to the World Cup.\"",
      "\"I was registered as FARA along with many members of my firm. That was the sole portion of my representation for Qatar,\" she said, referencing a federal law that requires lobbyists who work for foreign countries to register with the government.",
      "During Trump's first term, Bondi briefly left her lobbying position to serve as a member of his defense team during the first set of impeachment proceedings pursued by congressional Democrats. She defended Trump's July 2019 call with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate Mr. Biden.",
      "The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump for abuse of power and obstructing a congressional investigation, making him just the third U.S. president to ever be impeached. The Republican-led Senate then acquitted him following a trial, where Bondi was part of the team representing Trump.",
      "In the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Bondi spearheaded legal efforts to challenge the results in Pennsylvania and pushed the false claim that Trump won the state. She was asked about that work in Wednesday's hearing.",
      "\"I was an advocate for the campaign, and I was on the ground in Pennsylvania and I saw many things there. But do I accept the results? Of course I do. Do I agree with what happened?\" Bondi said. \"No one from either side of the aisle should want there to be any issues with election integrity in our country. We should all want our elections to be free and fair, and the rules and the law to be followed.\"",
      "Bondi was also among the Trump allies who traveled to New York and spoke out in defense of the president-elect early last year during his \"hush money\" criminal trial. A jury convicted Trump on 34 state felony counts of falsifying business records in May and he was sentenced last week.",
      "After the Justice Department brought criminal charges against Trump in 2023, Bondi told Fox News, \"The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted, the bad ones. The investigators will be investigated because the deep state last term for President Trump, they were hiding in the shadows. But now they have a spotlight on them.\"",
      "If confirmed, she will now lead that department and will have the power to look into various aspects of the investigations into Trump that were led by Smith. She will also oversee the numerous law enforcement components under the Justice Department, including the FBI and the ATF, two organizations that have been targets of the president-elect and his allies.",
      "Bondi will also oversee implementation of aspects of Trump's agency and lead the department that will defend the president-elect's actions in federal court.",

      "As deadly wildfires continue to rage in Los Angeles, attorneys representing those affected are headed to court, with multiple lawsuits alleging negligence by at least two public utilities in Southern California.",
      "Southern California Edison is accused of failing to maintain power lines and other equipment, allegedly helping to spark the 14,000-acre Eaton fire that decimated Altadena neighborhoods before spreading to other communities, according to a lawsuit filed by McNicholas & McNicholas, Becker Law Group and Singleton Schreiber.",

    "summary": "Trump's pick to be CIA director promised in his confirmation hearing to hone in on setting strong intelligence collection priorities and \"demanding relentless execution.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 John Ratcliffe, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be CIA director, promised the Senate Intelligence Committee that if he's confirmed, the CIA would be rededicated to its intelligence-gathering mission.",
      "\"We will collect intelligence \u2014 especially human intelligence \u2014 in every corner of the globe, no matter how dark or difficult,\" Ratcliffe said during his confirmation hearing Wednesday. \"We will produce insightful, objective, all-source analysis, never allowing political or personal biases to cloud our judgment or infect our products.\"",
      "\"To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,\" Ratcliffe said. \"If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.\"",
      "He told the committee the U.S. faces \"what may be the most challenging national security environment in our nation's history,\" and these challenges \"increase the necessity of confirming a CIA director who is prepared on Day One to take them head-on.\"",
      "The two-hour hearing was one of about a\u00a0dozen hearings\u00a0scheduled for Trump's top administration picks this week ahead of his return to the White House next week. Though some of the president-elect's designated nominees have been subject to aggressive questioning and tense exchanges, the open portion of Ratcliffe's hearing remained notably civil. None of the Democrats on the committee expressed opposition to his formal nomination and Senate confirmation, though it's not yet clear how many Senate Democrats will vote to confirm him.",
      "Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman, served as director of national intelligence in the final months of President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At that time, Trump initially picked Ratcliffe to lead the nation's spy agencies earlier in his first term, but withdrew his name amid questions about his qualifications for the role. Months later, Trump again nominated Ratcliffe, and the Senate confirmed him as director of national intelligence without any support from Democrats.",
      "Ratcliffe said in his opening remarks Wednesday that \"for roughly a quarter of a century, I have devoted my professional life to U.S. national security.\" And he promised that if confirmed, he would focus on \"setting and communicating priorities and demanding relentless execution.\"",
      "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton kicked off the hearing by listing the ways in which the CIA must \"get back to its roots,\" adding that it \"must overcome several challenges to do so.\" He argued the CIA has become too bureaucratic, and its analysis and priorities have become politicized, among other obstacles.",
      "\"Mr. Ratcliffe, you have a big job ahead of you,\" Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, said. \"The nation needs a strong capable and aggressive CIA.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, agreed with Ratcliffe that the CIA faces an \"unprecedented number of challenges,\" and he mentioned the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, competition with China and the persistent threat of terrorism, which he said requires a \"great deal of leadership.\"",
      "Warner also outlined the importance of ensuring the intelligence community feels \"respected and valued,\" amid what he called \"underserved attacks\" by President-elect Donald Trump. He told Ratcliffe he has an opportunity at his confirmation hearing to \"reassure the men and women of the CIA that they not fear reprisal for being willing to speak truth to power.\"",
      "In Congress, Ratcliffe served on the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee and was a staunch defender of Trump through his first impeachment and investigations into Russian election interference.",
      "In his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0in 2020 to be DNI, Ratcliffe vowed to deliver \"objective and timely\" intelligence to senior policymakers and to ensure that it was \"collected, analyzed and reported without bias, prejudice or political influence.\" He also disagreed with Trump about whether Russia meddled in the 2016 election, but declined to take a stance on what Russia's desired outcome was.",
      "During Wednesday's hearing, Ratcliffe faced a slew of questions about politicization of the CIA, pledging not to bow to political pressure from the administration or elsewhere or take action for political purposes.",
      "Ratcliffe also responded to questions about how he would resist efforts to force out career civil servants due to their perceived political views or loyalty to Trump, noting that during his time as director of national intelligence \"that never took place\" and is something he \"would never do.\"",
      "He vowed to work on the development of tools \"to go on offense\" against cyber adversaries, warning of the threat to the nation's digital borders \"from half a world away.\"",
      "The committee is proceeding with its questioning in a closed-door session. Cotton said the committee plans to vote on advancing Ratcliffe's nomination as soon as possible, as soon as Monday afternoon, after the inauguration.",
      "Ratcliffe's nomination",
      "Ratcliffe is considered to be a more traditional choice than some of Trump's picks for other roles, since he has served in a Senate-confirmed position once already and was also a member of Congress.",
      "As intelligence director, he was criticized by Democrats for declassifying in the final days of the 2020 presidential election Russian intelligence alleging damaging information about Democrats during the 2016 race even though he acknowledged it might not be true. But like top intelligence officials of Republican and Democratic administrations, he has also been warning for years of the threat posed by China to U.S. interests.",
      "China was among the topics at Wednesday's hearing, and in December 2020, Ratcliffe wrote that China \"poses the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.\" Ratcliffe, who was the nation's spy chief at the time, said he had shifted resources in the intelligence budget to make China more of a priority.",
      "\"Beijing is preparing for an open-ended period of confrontation with the U.S. Washington should also be prepared. Leaders must work across partisan divides to understand the threat, speak about it openly, and take action to address it,\" he wrote.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration is moving to cut out addictive nicotine from cigarettes, according to a long-awaited proposed regulation released Wednesday.",
      "The rule aims to force the nearly 12% of Americans still using combustible tobacco products to switch to less dangerous alternatives, like vaping electronic cigarettes or using nicotine lozenges, or quit altogether while ending rates of youth starting to smoke traditional cigarettes.",
      "\"The proposed product standard would limit the addictiveness of the most toxic and widely used tobacco products, which would have significant public health benefits for all age groups,\" the agency wrote in the\u00a0proposed rule.",
      "Though vaping rates have climbed in recent years, fewer adults vape than smoke traditional cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 6% of adults use e-cigarettes.",
      "It will now be up to the returning Trump administration to decide if and how to finalize this measure, which was first floated during President-elect Donald Trump's first term. At the time, the head of the FDA called it \"one of the most important actions I could take to advance public health.\"",
      "\"If there is a goal to Make America Healthy Again, I can't imagine anything more important to get done than this,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "A related effort to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes stalled out last year under the Biden administration, amid political blowback over the measure.",
      "The FDA says the proposed rule will apply to traditional cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and pipe tobacco. Cigarette manufacturers will have two years to come into compliance with the rule, after it is finalized.",
      "Agency officials stressed that they were not seeking to ban cigarettes or other tobacco products outright. They acknowledged the rule may result in some illegal imports of high nicotine cigarettes, but not enough to outweigh those switching or quitting. Half of smokers are expected to switch within the first years, they estimate.",
      "\"Even if some amount of illicit trade develops, we will still have a significantly greater magnitude of benefits that would outweigh any impacts of potential illicit markets,\" said Brian King, head of FDA's Center for Tobacco Products.",
      "Tobacco companies will need to cut nicotine levels to 0.7 milligrams per gram of tobacco, a fraction of the 17.2 milligrams per gram that most cigarette brands have on average.",
      "Why didn't the FDA ban nicotine earlier?",
      "Progress during the Trump administration halted after then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb stepped down from the agency, according to a former top-ranking official.",
      "\"We had no champion. And the day came when I was told by political appointees at FDA to stop talking about menthol and nicotine in my speeches. And we were basically told to stop working on them,\" said Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products from 2013 to 2022.",
      "The FDA's tobacco arm turned to other priorities in those years, Zeller said. The agency was facing a surge in youth e-cigarette use that began around 2018.",
      "Zeller credited Gottlieb for advocating for the nicotine regulation within the Trump White House, after the Obama administration had fallen short. Obama officials had promised Zeller they would back rules to curb nicotine and menthol.",
      "\"If you look back on the record, you'll see that the Obama administration did absolutely nothing. It was a very frustrating four years,\" Zeller said.",
      "Under President Biden, Zeller said the White House asked him to lay out a timeline for how a nicotine rule could be finalized by the end of 2024.

      "\"I would not be forwarding this timeline to you, if I didn't believe in good conscience that it could be met, as long as clearance times could be sped up,\" Zeller recalled telling White House officials.",
      "Califf defended the agency's delay in comments to media Wednesday, saying that the FDA needed to lay the groundwork for steep legal fights over the rule. He pointed to ongoing court battles \"fighting us tooth and nail\" over graphic warnings on cigarettes, saying \"we will be sued, on anything that comes into action.\"",
      "\"The research has to be airtight to survive the challenges that we know we'll get in court,\" he said.",
      "How can nicotine be removed from cigarettes?",
      "Zeller said agency officials carefully studied whether it was possible to require the industry to make cigarettes without addictive levels of nicotine.",
      "\"In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Philip Morris sold a very low-nicotine cigarette called Next. Now, it was not commercially successful. But I believe that Philip Morris more than 30 years ago answered the technical feasibility question for themselves and for the rest of us,\" he said.",
      "The Philip Morris cigarette had been produced with a similar process to decaffeinating coffee. At the time, the company had owned Kraft Foods and its decaf coffee production lines.",
      "A major study from the National Institutes of Health in 2015\u00a0that used reduced-nicotine cigarettes that the NIH contracted to manufacture showed reducing nicotine in cigarettes could substantially curb addiction, proving an idea first outlined in the 1990s.",
      "\"That study and a number of confirmatory studies that followed I think provide a very compelling scientific basis for this could be done,\" Zeller said.",
      "Other companies have found different ways to cut nicotine levels. Cigarette company 22nd Century Group earned the FDA's authorization in 2021 using tobacco that is genetically engineered to have 96% lower nicotine.",
      "While feasible to implement, Zeller predicted that finalizing the rule could face steep opposition from the industry.",
      "If successful, the rule would be an \"existential threat,\" he said, eliminating the main reason that smokers continue to use their products.",

    "summary": "In remarks to Congress, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Justice Department said that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end\" under her watch.",
    "story": [
      "Pam Bondi, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Justice, told the Senate Judiciary Committee\u00a0Wednesday that \"partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end,\" if she is confirmed as attorney general.",
      "\"America must have one tier of justice for all,\" the former Florida attorney general said.\u00a0 Her opening statement was earlier obtained exclusively by CBS News.",
      "The declaration comes as Democrats are expected to pepper the close ally of the president-elect with questions over whether she might weaponize the Justice Department to target Trump's political enemies, including President Biden and former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "The longtime prosecutor, who represented the president-elect during his first impeachment trial, says her \"overriding objective\" is to \"return the Department of Justice to its core mission,\" and vows to get the department \"back to basics \u2013 prosecuting violent crime and gang activity, stopping child predators and drug traffickers, protecting our nation from terrorists and other foreign threats, and addressing the overwhelming crisis at the Border.\"",
      "While seeking the job of the nation's highest ranking law enforcement officer, Bondi also plans to take aim at the Bureau of Prisons, promising to reduce recidivism and reform the federal agency long afflicted by understaffing, abuse, disrepair.",
      "\"We must fix the Bureau of Prisons and follow through on the promise of the First Step Act by building new halfway houses,\" Bondi said, referencing the president elect's hallmark criminal justice reform law. Signed by then-president Trump in 2018, it aims to reduce prison sentences and federal spending, but has been plagued by persistent implementation failures.",
      "\"The Bureau has suffered from years of mismanagement, lack of funding, and low morale. Federal corrections officers serve in challenging conditions on minimal pay and need more support. Our prison system can and will do better,\" Bondi told lawmakers Wednesday.",
      "Echoing the president-elect's promise of a \"new golden age,\" Bondi told lawmakers that Trump is \"unafraid to do things that have been deemed 'too difficult' and to reach across the aisle\" to address criminal justice reform.",
      "Trump selected Bondi to be his nominee for U.S. attorney general after his first pick, former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration. Bondi formerly made history in 2010 when she became the first woman to serve as Florida's attorney general, and became an early advocate for Trump during his first bid for the White House in 2016.",
      "Harking on her early days as \"an intern at the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office,\" Bondi spotlighted her 18 years of experience as a prosecutor and two terms as Florida attorney general, which she claims was defined by a fight to eliminate drug dealers in a state \"overwhelmed by pill mills and opioid deaths.\" While serving as Florida's top cop, Bondi established a prescription drug monitoring program which requires opioid-prescribing clinics to register with the state and have a physician-owner.",
      "\"On the civil side, we worked to protect consumers,\" Bondi said, touting her efforts to tackle \"overreach by big tech companies.\"",
      "If confirmed as attorney general, Bondi would inherit a slew of legal fights against the world's largest technology companies, including ongoing litigation with TikTok and the department's ongoing defense of a law that would force its parent company to sell the platform altogether.",
      "In the weeks leading up to her confirmation hearing, Bondi walked the halls of Capitol Hill, attending back-to-back meetings with senators. Unlike Trump's Gaetz, she is not expected to face significant hurdles to confirmation by the Republican-led Senate.",
      "Considered one of the less controversial choices for Trump's\u00a0new cabinet, Democrats are still likely to probe Bondi on her interpretation of the role of attorney general and commitment to the independence of the Justice Department.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, who met with Bondi last week, accused Trump of using the Justice Department as his personal law firm, expressing concern that she might prioritize loyalty to Trump over the Constitution.",
      "\"The Department of Justice must also return to defending the foundational rights of all Americans, including free speech, free exercise of religion, and the right to bear arms,\" Bondi said, name-checking a campaign tagline of the president-elect. \"That is what the American people expect and deserve from the Department.\u00a0 If confirmed, I will do what it takes to make America safe again.\"",

      "\"Libraries are one of the last vestiges of any place that's truly public space,\" he said. \"No one can be kicked out of a library for being poor.\"",
      "Reubendale has a personal connection to the mission of SAME Caf\u00e9. After coming out as gay, he lost his job as a pastor and found himself homeless\u00a0and living out of his car. During this difficult time, SAME Caf\u00e9 in Denver became a much-needed place of support for him. He would visit the caf\u00e9, often dressed up, and quietly make a small donation.",
      "\"I'd quietly put a dollar in because I didn't want to have to tell my trauma to be able to get access to the resource,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:31:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The red food dye is used in products ranging from candies to vegetarian meats.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday it had decided to revoke Red 3's authorization to be added to foods, over concerns about how the food coloring dye has been linked to cancer in laboratory animals.",
      "FDA officials have telegraphed the decision for months. While the agency has long said that it did not think evidence of Red 3 causing cancer applied to humans, officials said their hand was forced by a law requiring the agency to pull additives that are cancerous in animals.",
      "\"The Delaney Clause is clear; the FDA cannot authorize a food additive or color additive if it has been found to cause cancer in humans or animals. Evidence shows cancer in laboratory male rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, referring to the law.",
      "A post on the FDA's website states that Red 3's use in food or drugs \"puts people at risk are not supported by the available scientific information.\"",
      "Hundreds of food brands, including products ranging from candy and fruit cups to snack chips and tomato sauce, have contained Red 3 at some point, according to databases maintained by the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0and the nonprofit\u00a0Environmental Working Group, as well as nutrition labels disclosed by food companies.",
      "Wednesday's decision stems from a petition filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a number of other groups in 2022, calling for the additive to be pulled from the market. Food brands will have until January 2027 to stop using the dye.",
      "The group has also championed a move by California in 2023 to ban the food dye, which is already banned from use in cosmetics.",
      "\"The primary purpose of food dyes is to make candy, drinks, and other processed foods more attractive. When the function is purely aesthetic, why accept any cancer risk?\" said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in a statement.",
      "While the group has highlighted Red 3's link to cancer in pushes to ban the additive, it is concerns over a different health concern \u2014 the possibility that artificial food dyes could be causing hyperactivity in children \u2014 that has fueled opposition to this and another dye called Red 40 used in many U.S. food products.",
      "An influential review by California''s Environmental Protection Agency of studies on synthetic food dyes, including Red 3, concluded in 2021 that colorants \"can impact neurobehavior in some children.\"",
      "What foods and drinks contain Red 3?",
      "Red 3 has been authorized for use in at least some foods by countries around the world, according to the International Association of Color Manufacturers, under other names like erythrosine or E 127. In Europe, Red 3 is only permitted for use in cocktail cherries and candied cherries.",
      "In the U.S., Red 3 is used in some candies, including Jelly Belly's Candy Corn, Tootsie's Dubble Bubble ball gum and Ring Pop's strawberry and berry blast flavors. Other foods also use Red 3, like Del Monte cherry mixed fruit cups, MorningStar Farms vegetarian Bacon Strips and Pillsbury's birthday cake cookie dough.",
      "Several drinks rely on Red 3 as well, among them Ensure's creamy peach nutrition shake and Nesquik's strawberry lowfat milk.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, the candy industry pledged to comply with the FDA's guidance and safety standards. Industry groups have been calling on the agency to step up its regulation of food additives, citing concerns that a vacuum left by FDA inaction could lead to a frustrating patchwork of state laws for national food brands.",
      "\"Our consumers and everyone in the food industry want and expect a strong FDA, and a consistent, science-based national regulatory framework. We have been saying for years that FDA is the rightful national regulatory decision maker and leader in food safety,\" said the National Confections Association's statement.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the federal department that will oversee the FDA, has been critical of the agency for not moving to curb use of certain food additives.",
      "Kennedy and his allies have\u00a0also called for\u00a0tightening the FDA's approach to regulating food additives, which critics have derided as a \"loophole\" allowing in concerning ingredients. That process is separate from artificial colors like Red 3 and Red 40, which must jump through steep hurdles to gain the FDA's authorization and are carefully tested for purity before being used in the market.",

      "\"We are deeply grateful that there is finally an agreement between Israel and Hamas to bring our loved ones \u2014 Omer, Edan, Sagui, Itay, Keith, Gad, and Judi \u2014 home,\" the families said in a statement. \"We have been waiting for 467 days while our family members suffer from life-threatening injuries, abuse, torture, and sexual violence. We thank President Biden, President-elect Trump, and their teams for their constructive efforts to make this possible.\"",
      "A draft of the deal had been agreed to in principle earlier in the week, Arab, U.S. and Israeli officials told CBS News. It sets out a phased framework for a ceasefire and the exchange of hostages still held by Hamas for a larger number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. It also includes access for humanitarian aid to Gaza and the eventual ability of Palestinians in Gaza to return to areas they fled.",
      "Intense negotiations had been underway in Doha for the past few weeks, with President Biden's top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, staying in the region for the better part of a month. McGurk has been closely coordinating with President-elect Donald Trump's pick for special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.",
      "Mr. Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone on Sunday about the negotiations and again on Wednesday. A senior U.S. official described their latest conversation as \"a very warm call, marking this moment.\"",
      "In Israel, families of the approximately 100 hostages still being held after Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 2023 attack, which saw the group and allied militants kill about 1,200 people, have been holding regular rallies demanding a negotiated deal for the release of their loved ones. The Israel Defense Forces has said it believes around a third of the hostages have already died.",
      "More than 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in Israeli strikes since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, and most of Gaza's population is displaced and living in camps. Humanitarian groups have been struggling to deliver aid, and experts have warned of famine.",
      "What is in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal?",
      "Details of the deal are similar to a plan outlined by Mr. Biden last year. The deal is expected to go into effect on Sunday.",
      "According to a draft from mediator sources, viewed by CBS News earlier this week, and Mr. Biden's description, it would consist of three phases, each lasting about 42 days.",
      "During the first phase, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old, the draft viewed by CBS News said. The first phase will also include the withdrawal of all Israeli forces from populated areas of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel is expected to release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "A senior Israeli official told CBS News that the release of hostages from Israel would begin on the first day of a 42-day ceasefire period. Mr. Biden said Americans will be among the first wave of hostages released.",
      "On that first day, Hamas would release three hostages, according to the draft viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release four hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release three hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operations in Gaza, and would begin reconstruction of the enclave's infrastructure, such as water, electricity and sewage systems.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all remaining male Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of all IDF forces from Gaza, the president announced Wednesday.",
      "The third phase would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners and the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, Mr. Biden said.",
      "Trump responds to ceasefire and hostage release deal",
      "In his remarks, Mr. Biden noted that the deal will largely be implemented after his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, takes office.",
      "\"This deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration,\" the president said. \"For these past few days, we've been speaking as one team.\"",
      "Trump posted on social media as news broke of the hostage and ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" Trump wrote. \"I am thrilled American and Israeli hostages will be returning home to be reunited with their families and loved ones.\"",
      "Trump said his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, will continue to work closely with Israel \"to make sure Gaza NEVER again becomes a terrorist safe haven.\"",
      "\"We have achieved so much without even being in the White House,\" Trump wrote. \"Just imagine all of the wonderful things that will happen when I return to the White House, and my Administration is fully confirmed, so they can secure more Victories for the United States!\"",
      "Trump is at his Mar-a-Lago estate Wednesday, with five days to go until he becomes president.",
      "Asked how much credit Trump should get for the deal, White House national security communications adviser John Kirby told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns: \"I would hope we would all move beyond the question of who gets credit. I mean, I don't think that the hostages are caring about that, and I don't think their families care about that. I don't think the Palestinians in Gaza care about who gets credit for this. The truth is that there's a lot of credit to go around, including in the [Mideast] region.\"",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration worked closely with their counterparts on Trump's team.",
      "\"It's important to remember that this deal was the deal that President Biden negotiated and put on the table back in May, got international support for it. That's the deal that we're talking about being implemented here,\" Kirby said. \"And it was due to a lot of intense diplomacy by American diplomats.\"",

      "Methanol is a substance that's often added to alcohol to increase its potency.

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 South Korea's impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol was detained in a massive law enforcement operation at the presidential compound Wednesday, defiantly insisting the anti-corruption agency didn't have the authority to investigate his actions but saying he complied to prevent violence.",
      "In a video message recorded before he was escorted to the headquarters of the anti-corruption agency, Yoon lamented the \"rule of law has completely collapsed in this country.\"",
      "Yoon, the country's first sitting president to be apprehended, had been holed up in the Hannam-dong residence in the capital, Seoul, for weeks while vowing to \"fight to the end\" the efforts to oust him. He has justified his brief declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 as a legitimate act of governance against an \"anti-state\" opposition employing its legislative majority to thwart his agenda.",
      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said Yoon was brought into custody about five hours after investigators arrived at the presidential compound and about three hours after they successfully entered the residence, in their second attempt to detain him over his imposition of martial law.",
      "A series of black SUVs, some equipped with sirens, were seen leaving the presidential compound with police escorts. Yoon was later seen stepping out of a vehicle after arriving at the agency's office in the nearby city of Gwacheon.",
      "Hundreds of Yoon's conservative supporters rallied near the anti-corruption agency's office as he underwent questioning, shouting slogans and holding signs that read: \"We will fight alongside President Yoon Suk Yeol.\"",
      "An unidentified man was in life-threatening condition after an apparent self-immolation near the site, according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department.",
      "Following the questioning, Yoon was sent to a detention center in Uiwang, near Seoul. He could be held in custody for weeks.",
      "The anti-corruption agency, which is leading a joint investigation with the police and the military over whether Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an attempted rebellion, has 48 hours to request a court order for a formal arrest on a charge of attempting a rebellion, and if it fails to do so, Yoon will be released. If Yoon is formally arrested, investigators can extend his detention to 20 days before transferring the case to public prosecutors for indictment.",
      "The anti-corruption agency told reporters that Yoon, during his first two hours of questioning, exercised his right to remain silent.",
      "The detainment warrant for Yoon, issued by the Seoul Western District Court, said there were substantial reasons to suspect that he committed crimes as a \"ringleader of a rebellion.\"",
      "Yoon's presidential powers were suspended when parliament impeached him on Dec. 14. The impeachment case now rests with the Constitutional Court, which could formally remove Yoon from office or reject the case and reinstate him.",
      "In a separate message posted on his Facebook account after his detainment, Yoon claimed that \"martial law is not a crime,\" saying his declaration was necessary to raise awareness about an opposition that was exercising \"legislative dictatorship by blocking laws and budgets\" and \"paralyzing\" state affairs. He denied the rebellion accusations, describing his impeachment as \"fraud.\"",
      "As they began the detention operation in the early morning, the anti-corruption investigators and police officers engaged in an hourslong standoff at the compound's gate with presidential security forces but otherwise encountered no meaningful resistance.",
      "Police officers were seen using wire cutters to remove the barbed wire placed by the presidential security service on the perimeter of the compound to block their entry. Some police officers used ladders to climb over rows of buses placed by the presidential security service near the compound's entrance, and then the investigators began moving up the hilly compound. The investigators and police later arrived in front of a metal gate with a gold presidential mark that's near Yoon's residential building. Some officers were seen entering a security door on the side of the metal gate, joined by one of Yoon's lawyers and his chief of staff. The presidential security service later removed a bus and other vehicles that had been parked tightly inside the gate as a barricade.",
      "Despite a court warrant for Yoon's detention, the presidential security service had insisted it's obligated to protect the impeached president and fortified the compound with barbed wire and rows of buses blocking paths.",
      "South Korea's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, issued a statement early Wednesday urging law enforcement and the presidential security service to ensure there are no \"physical clashes.\"",
      "Following Yoon's detainment, Choi met with diplomats from the Group of Seven nations, including the United States, Japan, Britain and Germany, as well as the representative of the European Union, to reassure them that the government was functioning stably.",
      "Park Chan-dae, floor leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, which drove the legislative campaign that led to Yoon's impeachment on Dec. 14, said Yoon's detention is the \"first step toward restoring constitutional order, democracy, and realizing the rule of law.\"",
      "As investigators moved up the hillside compound, lawmakers from Yoon's People Power Party held a rally in nearby streets, decrying the efforts to detain him as unlawful.",
      "The National Police Agency met with field commanders in Seoul and nearby Gyeonggi province in recent days to plan their detainment efforts, and the size of those forces fueled speculation that more than a thousand officers could be deployed. The agency and police had openly warned that presidential bodyguards obstructing the execution of the warrant could be arrested.",
      "Yoon's lawyers have claimed that the detainment warrant issued by the Seoul Western District Court was invalid. They cited a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge \u2014 which would be Yoon. They also claimed that the anti-corruption agency had no legal authority to investigate rebellion allegations.",
      "\"I am truly appalled to see illegalities upon illegalities upon illegalities being carried out and procedures being forcefully conducted under an invalid warrant,\" Yoon said in the video released before his detention. \"I do not acknowledge the investigation by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials. As the president, who is responsible for upholding the constitution and legal system of the Republic of Korea, my decision to comply with such illegal and invalid procedures is not an acknowledgment of them, but rather a willingness to prevent unfortunate and bloody incidents.\"",
      "Yoon's supporters and critics have held competing protests near the residence \u2014 one side vowing to protect him, the other calling for his imprisonment \u2014 while thousands of police officers in yellow jackets closely monitored the tense situation.",
      "Yoon declared martial law and deployed troops around the National Assembly on Dec. 3. It lasted only hours before lawmakers managed to get through the blockade and vote to lift the measure. \u00a0The opposition-led assembly voted to impeach him on rebellion charges Dec. 14.",
      "The Constitutional Court held its first formal hearing in the impeachment case on Tuesday, but the session lasted less than five minutes because Yoon refused to attend. The next hearing is set for Thursday, and the court will then proceed with the trial whether or not Yoon is there.",
      "The White House National Security Council issued a statement saying that the United States stands by its support for the Korean people and \"our shared commitment to the rule of law.\" It said Washington remains committed to working with the government led by Seoul's acting leader, Choi, and reaffirms the strength of the countries' alliance.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 13:28:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada decided to stick with the lawyer defending him from U.S. drug trafficking charges despite a possible conflict of interest.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. prosecutors said Wednesday that they're discussing a potential plea deal with Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the long-elusive Mexican drug lord who was arrested last summer and whose son could testify against him if he goes to trial.",
      "Assistant U.S. attorney Francisco Navarro said the plea discussions with Zambada, a leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, haven't borne fruit so far, but prosecutors want to keep trying. A judge scheduled an April 22 hearing for an update.",
      "Zambada's lead attorney, Frank Perez, declined to comment on the discussions.",
      "It's common for prosecutors and defense lawyers to explore whether they can reach a deal, and the talks don't necessarily go anywhere.",
      "Zambada was an attentive and active participant during Wednesday's hearing, which focused on whether he wanted Perez to continue representing him even while also representing a potential government witness in the case - Zambada's son Vicente Zambada.",
      "\"I don't want a different attorney,\" the father said through a court interpreter. \"I want him, even though this could be a conflict if he represents me and my son.\"",
      "The younger Zambada was charged himself and made a plea deal in the long-running and sprawling U.S. prosecutions of Sinaloa cartel figures. He testified for the government at the trial of the cartel's infamous and now imprisoned co-founder, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n.",
      "Working alongside Guzm\u00e1n, Ismael Zambada kept a lower profile and was seen as concentrating more on the business of smuggling than the extremes of brutality, serving as a strategist and dealmaker who engaged with day-to-day operations, authorities say.",
      "At Guzm\u00e1n's trial, Vicente Zambada recounted how his father and Guzm\u00e1n ran the cartel together. At one point, he described corrupt Mexican politicians asking whether the syndicate could help them ship 100 tons of cocaine in an oil tanker.",
      "\"They wanted to know if my dad and Chapo could provide that amount of coke,\" he told a jury in the same Brooklyn federal courthouse where his father is being prosecuted. At another point, Vicente Zambada recalled hearing a rival drug gang leader say he wanted to kill Ismael Zambada and Guzm\u00e1n to avenge a botched hit.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court document last month that the son might be called to testify against his father, which could pose a conflict of interest for Perez. For instance, he'd be hindered in cross-examining the son because of the loyalty he owes both clients.",
      "Defense lawyers do sometimes have potential conflicts of interest regarding a client, and federal courts have outlined the steps judges should take to address such situations. Among them is having an independent lawyer advise defendants as they consider what to do about the possible conflict. Zambada had one at Wednesday's hearing.",
      "Zambada said he realized there could be problems with Perez representing him and his son - \"for example, that he will have to hide information that he obtained from Vicente from me.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ultimately agreed that Perez could stay on the case, noting that Ismael Zambada also has other lawyers who could handle any piece of it relating to his son.",
      "Law enforcement sought the elder Zambada for years before his startling arrest in July at an airport near El Paso, Texas, after arriving in a private plane with one of Guzm\u00e1n's sons, Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez. He, too, was wanted by U.S. authorities.",
      "Zambada has said he was kidnapped in Mexico and hauled to the U.S. by Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, whose lawyer denies those claims. Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his brother Ovidio are in plea negotiations with the U.S. government, their lawyers said this month in a Chicago courtroom.",
      "Following the July arrests and Zambada's allegations of kidnapping, horrific fighting erupted in Mexico between a cartel faction loyal to him and another tied to the \"Chapitos,\" Guzm\u00e1n's sons.",
      "The Chapitos have used corkscrews, electrocution and hot chiles to\u00a0torture their rivals\u00a0while some of their victims were \"fed dead or alive to tigers,\" according to an indictment released by the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "In recent months, bodies have appeared across Sinaloa, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either\u00a0sombreros on their heads\u00a0or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",
      "The chain of events also strained relations between Mexico and the United States.",
      "First, Mexico's president at the time, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, and current President Claudia Sheinbaum laid part of the blame for the bloodshed at Washington's feet, saying the U.S. arrests uncorked trouble.",
      "The outgoing U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Ken Salazar, responded that it was \"incomprehensible\" to suggest the cartel wars were Washington's fault. He subsequently asserted that the Mexican government had stopped cooperating with Washington on fighting cartels and was sticking its head in the sand about violence and police corruption.",

      "The barrage came a day after the Russian Defense Ministry vowed a response to what it said was an attack on Russian soil using multiple Western-supplied missiles. Kyiv hasn't confirmed that attack, though it said Tuesday that it hit an oil refinery and a fuel storage depot, a chemical plant producing ammunition and two anti-aircraft missile systems, in a missile and drone attack that reached almost 700 miles into Russia.",
      "Long-range attacks have been a feature of the nearly three-year war, where on the front line snaking about 600 miles from northeast to southern Ukraine, the armies have been engaged in a war of attrition. Russia has been advancing on the battlefield over the past year, though its progress has been slow and costly.",
      "Russia attacked Ukraine with 43 missiles and 74 drones overnight, the Ukrainian Air Force said. A total of 30 missiles and 47 drones were shot down, and 27 drones failed to reach their target, it said.",
      "The Russian missiles sought out targets from the Lviv region in western Ukraine near Poland to Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine bordering Russia. The state energy company Ukrenergo reported emergency power outages in six regions. It often shuts down production during attacks as a precaution.",
      "\"The enemy continues to terrorize Ukrainians,\" Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko wrote on Facebook.",
      "Electricity supplies resumed to households in some areas by the middle of the day, but Ukrenergo urged customers to avoid using power-hungry electrical appliances.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to cripple Ukraine's power grid, denying the country heat, electricity and running water in an effort to break the Ukrainian spirit. The attacks have also sought to disrupt Ukraine's defense manufacturing industry.",
      "Last September, the U.N. refugee agency reported that Ukraine had lost more than an estimated 60% of its energy generation capacity.",
      "Ukrainian authorities try to rebuild their power generation after the attack, though the barrages have eroded production. Western partners have been helping Ukraine rebuild.",
      "\"It is the middle of the winter, and Russia's goal remains unchanged: our energy infrastructure,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram.",
      "He urged Western partners to accelerate the delivery to Ukraine of promised air defense weapons, emphasizing that \"promises have been made but not yet fully realized.\"",
      "Poland vows to push forward Ukraine's EU membership quest",
      "Separately, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk vowed on Wednesday to use his country's presidency of the European Union to push forward with Ukraine's membership quest.",
      "\"We will break the standstill we have in this issue,\" Tusk told reporters in Warsaw, as he stood alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We will accelerate the accession process.\"",

      "The victim of the mass abuse in Kerala is a member of the Dalit community, which is the lowest caste in India. Dalits have faced widespread discrimination and abuse for many years.",
      "Criminal cases have also been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, as the majority of the alleged abuse took place when the girl was a minor, Deputy Superintendent Nandakumar told the BBC's Hindi language service.",
      "The horrific scale of the alleged abuse has drawn national headlines in a country where an average of almost 90 rapes were reported every day in 2022, the most recent year for which national data is available. Many more are believed to go unreported.",

      "A draft deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and hostage release has been agreed to in principle and, if all goes well, will be finalized by Israel and Hamas this week, Arab, U.S. and Israeli officials told CBS News.",
      "If final details are approved, and the Israeli government also votes to approve it shortly thereafter, implementation of the deal could begin this weekend, U.S. and regional sources said. That means President Biden's long-sought ceasefire deal could come together in the final days of his presidency, and incoming President-elect Donald Trump would oversee its implementation.",
      "Sources tell CBS News that the parties have begun drafting public statements of success and hopes are high on all sides.",

      "While the Biden administration has been drafting a detailed plan for the so-called \"Day After\" the Israeli withdrawal in Gaza, its implementation and enforcement would be left to the Trump administration. Privately, U.S. officials acknowledge this plan for governance is aspirational, and it would be up to the Trump team to help shape the future of Palestinian Gaza and pressure the Netanyahu government and Hamas to adhere to later phases of the deal.",
      "\"I think the pressure is building for Hamas to come to yes, and I think Israel also has achieved a huge amount of its military objectives in Gaza, and therefore, they are in a position to be able to say 'yes,'\" U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters.",

      "The deal presented to Israel and Hamas appears similar to that arrangement, according to a copy of the deal from mediator sources seen by CBS News and a senior Israeli official.",
      "The deal consists of three phases, according to the copy viewed by CBS News, each one to be negotiated as things progress.",
      "During the first phase, which would take place over a 42 days ceasefire period, Hamas would release 33 women and children hostages, as well as hostages over 50 years old. For each woman or child hostage returned to Israel, Israel would release 30 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Hamas would release all hostages over 50 years of age, and Israel would release 30 Palestinian prisoners aged 50 or older.",
      "On the first day of that ceasefire, Hamas would release 3 hostages, according to the document viewed by CBS News. On the seventh day, Hamas would release 4 hostages. Thereafter, Hamas would release 3 hostages taken from Israel every seven days, starting with the living and then moving on to return the bodies of those who have died.",
      "During the exchange of hostages and prisoners, there would be a complete ceasefire in Gaza to allow aid to enter, the draft viewed by CBS News said. International aid groups and the United Nations would resume operation in Gaza, and reconstruction of its infrastructure, like water, electricity and sewage systems, would begin. There would also be negotiations over the next phase of the deal.",
      "The second phase of the deal would involve the release of all the Israeli male hostages and the withdrawal of the IDF from Gaza, according to the document viewed by CBS News.",
      "The third phase, which would be partially negotiated during earlier phases, would include the exchange of bodies of deceased hostages and prisoners, the beginning of the reconstruction of Gaza, and the opening of its borders.",
      "Despite the intense mediation by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, the talks have repeatedly stalled over issues including the details of the hostage and prisoner exchanges, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and whether the ceasefire would be permanent.",
      "Hamas and other groups in Gaza are still holding captive around 100 hostages kidnapped during the Oct. 7 2023 attack. Militants killed around 1,200 people in that attack and abducted 250.",
      "Over 46,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed by Israel in its response to the Oct. 7 attack, according to the Hamas-run ministry of health, and the majority of Gaza's 2.3 people have been displaced. Humanitarian groups have struggled to deliver aid and experts have warned of famine.",

      "The files about royal art historian Anthony Blunt are among a trove from the intelligence agency MI5 released Tuesday by Britain's National Archives. They shed new light on a spy ring linked to Cambridge University in the 1930s, whose members spilled secrets to the Soviet Union from the heart of the U.K. intelligence establishment.",
      "Blunt, who worked at Buckingham Palace as Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, was under suspicion for years before he finally confessed in 1964 that, as a senior MI5 officer during World War II, he had passed secret information to Soviet agents.",
      "In one of the newly released files, an MI5 officer notes that Blunt said he felt \"profound relief\" at unburdening himself. In return for information he provided, Blunt was allowed to keep his job, his knighthood and his social standing \u2013 and the queen was apparently kept in the dark.",
      "In 1972, her private secretary, Martin Charteris, told MI5 chief Michael Hanley that \"the queen did not know and he saw no advantage in telling her about it now; it would only add to her worries and there was nothing that could done about him.\"",
      "The government decided to tell the monarch in 1973, when Blunt was ill, fearing a media uproar once Blunt died and journalists were able to publish stories without fear of libel suits.",
      "Charteris reported that \"she took it all very calmly and without surprise,\" and \"remembered that he had been under suspicion way back\" in the early 1950s. Historian Christopher Andrew says in the official history of MI5 that the queen had previously been told about Blunt in \"general terms.\"",
      "Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96.",

Some of the newly released documents will feature in an exhibition, entitled \"MI5: Official Secrets,\" opening at the National Archives in London later this year.",
      "Two of the Cambridge spies, Donald Maclean and Guy Burgess, fled to Russia in 1951. A third, Kim Philby, continued to work for foreign intelligence agency MI6 despite falling under suspicion.

      "The declassified files include Philby's typed confession and a transcript of his discussion with Elliott.",
      "In it, Philby admitted he had betrayed Konstantin Volkov, a KGB officer who tried to defect to the West in 1945, bringing with him details of moles inside British intelligence \u2013 including Philby himself. As a result of Philby's intervention, Volkov was abducted in Istanbul, taken back to Moscow and executed.",
      "Elliott reported that Philby said that if he had his life to lead again, he would probably have behaved in the same way.",
      "\"I really did feel a tremendous loyalty to MI6. I was treated very, very well in it and I made some really marvelous friends there,\" Philby said, according to the transcript. \"But the overruling inspiration was the other side.\"",

    "story": [
      "With a world at war in Ukraine, the Middle East and Sudan, President Biden argued in a speech at the State Department on Monday that his administration has strengthened partnerships around the world, bettered the United States' position on the global stage and weakened key adversaries.",
      "When Mr. Biden took office four years ago, he sought to reassure global allies and reestablish foreign treaties from which the Trump administration had withdrawn. The president reestablished strong relationships with leaders of NATO countries in the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine and reentered the Paris climate agreement. But world leaders have been preparing for significant changes with President-elect Donald Trump's impending inauguration.",
      "\"I come here to the State Department to report to the American people on the progress we've made in the last four years, in our foreign policy, in our presidency,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I've said many times, we are at an inflection point. The post Cold-War era is over. A new era has begun. In these four years, we faced crises, we've been tested, we've come through those tests, stronger in my view, than we entered those tests. This is a fierce competition underway. The future of the global economy, technology, human values and so much else. Right now, in my view, thanks to our administration, the United States is winning the world-wide competition.\"",
      "Specifically, the president made the case that the United States' partnerships and transnational institutions are significantly stronger than they were before he took office, a key claim of his presidency.",
      "\"Today, I can report to the American people, our alliances are stronger than they've been in decades,\" he said. \"NATO is more capable than it's ever been. And many more of our allies are paying their fair share.\"",
      "But the president also sought to make the case that the United States' \"adversaries are weaker than they were when we came into this job four years ago.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin has \"failed\" to subjugate Ukraine and weaken NATO. The president touted his work to rally the world around Ukraine, another central piece of his foreign policy.",
      "\"As I saw it, when Putin launched his invasion, I had two jobs \u2014 one to rally the world to defend Ukraine, and the other is to avoid war between two nuclear powers,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We did both those things. Today, Ukraine is still a free, independent country, with a potential, a potential for a bright future.\"",
      "He also argued that Iran is weaker than it's been in \"decades,\" saying Iran's main proxy Hezbollah is \"badly wounded\" and Iran's economy is in \"desperate straits.\"",
      "Something that has remained elusive for the Biden administration is the freeing of the hostages Hamas captured in Israel, which has been a top priority for the president and his aides. National security adviser Jake Sullivan said before Mr. Biden's speech on Monday the parties are \"close to a deal and it can get done this week,\" but also said he couldn't make a promise or a prediction.",
      "In his speech, the president briefly mentioned the soldiers who died during the chaotic and deadly withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, while emphasizing that he has been the president to end United States' involvement in its longest war.",
      "\"We grieve all 2,461 Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice in the longest war in American history,\" he said. \"And I grieve those brave service members whose lives were lost during the withdrawal.\"",
      "Thirteen U.S. service members\u00a0died in an attack\u00a0outside of the Kabul airport amid the evacuation as the Taliban took over control of the country faster than the U.S. expected.",
      "Mr. Biden also laid out the challenges ahead for the incoming Trump administration, which will have to deal with a chaotic Middle East, Russia's nearly three-year war on Ukraine and a tenuous situation in the Red Sea.",
      "\"Make no mistake, there are serious challenges the United States must continue to deal with, in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in the Indo-Pacific,\" he said. \"Must keep the pressure on the Houthis who are attacking ships in the Red Sea, launching missiles at Israel, and firing at American forces. Must deter North Korea as they rattle their saber and draw closer to Russia. And new challenges will certainly emerge in the months and years ahead.\"",
      "\"But even \u2014 but even so, it's clear,\" he continued. \"My administration is leaving the next administration with a very strong hand to play. And we're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure. An America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.\"",
      "The president recently told USA Today that he had helped reset ties that had frayed during the Trump administration, saying he had managed an \"inflection point\" in history. He credited his long history in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with helping him \"navigate some of the fundamental changes taking place, whether it's in Europe, in Latin America, in the Middle East, in the Far East.\"",
      "\"The only advantage of being an old guy is that I've known every major world leader for a long time,\" he told USA Today's Susan Page. \"And so I had a perspective on each of them and their interests.\"",
      "Jake Sullivan said the president will argue \"America is winning that contest for the future.\"",
      "In his first foreign policy speech as president, in 2021, Mr. Biden aimed to tie foreign and domestic policy interests by arguing for a foreign policy for the middle class. The focus was meant to be on China and repairing alliances but was disrupted by crises in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "\"The United States is in a worse geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,\" says Stephen Wertheim, historian and senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \"The United States is immersed in a massive war on the European continent with serious escalation risks; it's back to bombing the Middle East with no end in sight; and it has entered into a full-spectrum strategic rivalry with China.\"",
      "A look at the major foreign policy issues of his presidency:",
      "Ukraine, Russia and NATO",
      "Mr. Biden has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine, becoming the first president to go to a conflict zone where U.S. troops were not involved and directing over $183 billion dollars in military aid since Russia's invasion in 2021. He played a key role in getting NATO to spend more on collective defense.",
      "Yet the fierce battle continues on the frontlines with no clear plan for a peace deal. Washington deferred to Kyiv on when and how negotiations should take place with the tagline \"nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\"",
      "The administration was criticized early in the conflict for holding back on sending the most lethal weapons and later by some Republicans for spending too much money on Ukraine aid.",
      "Mr. Biden is expected to argue that his policies have ensured the survival of Ukraine as an independent state and thwarted Putin's ambitions, a senior administration official tells CBS News.",
      "Israel-Hamas war",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed over 1,200 civilians, Mr. Biden made it clear that Israel has the right to defend itself with his administration sending over billions of dollars worth of military assistance.",
      "As Israel launched a war on Gaza that has killed more than 45,000 people according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry and led to a humanitarian crisis, the administration did not change its stance.",
      "In April 2023, Mr. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanhayu that future U.S. support of his country was dependent on Israel protecting civilians and aid workers in Gaza.",
      "\"Biden willingly threw away his leverage by immediately pledging military support for Israel; then he criticized the Israeli government's decisions from the self-imposed sidelines,\" Wertheim said.",
      "The State Department informed Congress earlier this month of a planned $8 billion weapons transfer to Israel. Ceasefire negotiations are still underway between Israel and Hamas as pressure mounts for a deal to be reached prior to Trump's inauguration on January 20.",
      "Chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "The most glaring foreign policy failure was the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.",
      "Mr. Biden had promised to end America's longest war and assured Americans that the Afghan military was capable of holding off a Taliban takeover. Instead the Taliban expanded its control of territory across the country more quickly than the U.S. expected and seized Kabul as the Afghan government collapsed. The U.S. hastily evacuated about 125,000 people, including 6,000 Americans, over the course of its frenzied withdrawal, but dozens of Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were\u00a0killed in a suicide bombing\u00a0outside Hamid Karzai airport in Kabul as thousands sought to flee the country.",
      "U.S. citizens and Afghan allies who supported American troops throughout the war were left behind. Thousands feared retribution from the Taliban and felt abandoned by an American government that had promised to take care of them.",
      "Images of Afghans clinging onto military planes in hopes of escape, and U.S. military weapons left behind and paraded about by the Taliban became emblematic of the missteps leading up to the evacuation.",
      "In the three years since the Taliban returned to power, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have established a presence in the country, and\u00a0Afghan women and girls have been deprived of basic freedoms\u00a0they enjoyed during two decades of Western-backed government following the U.S.-led invasion in 2001.",
      "China",
      "Trump began a trade war with China\u00a0and other countries during his first term, imposing tariffs that were aimed at deterring what he saw as unfair trade practices and to encourage American consumers and businesses to buy and sell more goods made at home. While the rhetoric changed under Mr Biden, he nonetheless continued the tariff policy. And as was the case during the Trump administration, both have viewed China as a security threat, not just an economic one.",
      "The Biden administration put safeguards in place to help protect industries like chip production from relying on China. Global alliances such as the Quad \u2014\u00a0 U.S., India, Japan and Australia \u2014\u00a0 and AUKUS \u2013 Australia, the U.S. and U.K. \u2013 made diplomatic and military headway in deterrence against China. And the Biden administration has also enhanced its military alliance with Japan.",
      "Mr. Biden was vice president when former President Barack Obama delivered his \"pivot to Asia\" speech. American policymakers have been attempting to shift foreign policy focus ever since, but there has been a world of distractions along the way.",
      "\"The United States cannot expect to prioritize China while remaining the leading military power in Europe and the Middle East. If the United States truly wants to prioritize China, it needs to pull back elsewhere,\"\u00a0 Wertheim said.",

    "summary": "President Biden spoke by phone Sunday with the families of three Americans held by the Taliban, Ryan Corbett, George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi.",
    "story": [
      "In a roughly 30-minute phone call Sunday afternoon, President Biden delivered difficult news to the families of three Americans held by the Taliban. He did not have a deal with the Taliban to free their loved ones from captivity, despite what U.S. officials described to CBS News as a significant offer the U.S. had extended in Doha days earlier. The U.S. considers Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann to be wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and describes Mahmood Habibi, who holds dual American and Afghan citizenship, as \"unjustly held\" since 2022.",
      "Ahmad Shah Habibi, the brother of Mahmood Habibi, told CBS News that during the conversation, Mr. Biden clarified that he would not agree to the Taliban's demand that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al Afghani, a detainee at Guantanamo Bay, unless the Taliban, now the government of Afghanistan, also releases Mahmood. An NSC spokesman declined to respond to a CBS inquiry about that specific claim.",
      "Mahmood Habibi disappeared in Afghanistan in 2022, and the Taliban denied abducting him. In a public notice posted by the FBI in August 2024, the agency said it \"believed\" that Habibi was taken by Taliban military or security forces and \"has not been heard from since his disappearance.\" The FBI said in its notice that Habibi was working as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecom company when he disappeared.",
      "The Taliban still say they do not have Habibi in custody.",
      "\"No, we don't have him,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News Monday.",
      "Asked whether Mahmoud had disappeared in Afghanistan, Mujahid said, \"It's not clear either, because we didn't know him before.\"",
      "Ahmad Habibi told CBS News, \"My family has every confidence that my brother is alive. There are things that neither we nor the U.S. government can say publicly, but Mahmood's case is different from the other two Americans.\"",
      "\"We know the other families are desperate to get their loved ones home and I told the president we want them home, too,\" Ahmad Habibi added. \"But anyone speculating that my brother is dead is just feeding into Taliban claims. We are grateful that President Biden committed to not leave Mahmood behind,\" and he said that national security adviser Jake Sullivan had also made similar assurances.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Corbett, who is fluent in Pashto, was working for local nongovernmental organizations before starting a microloan and consulting business in Kabul when he was arrested with three associates \u2014 one German and two Afghans \u2014 during a business trip to northern Afghanistan in 2022.",
      "Glezmann is an Atlanta native who was detained while on a tourist visit in December 2022.",
      "The family of Ryan Corbett is publicly calling on Mr. Biden to consider a deal to bring him and Glezmann home.",
      "\"We hope that President Biden will have the courage to take the deal in front of him, given that the lives of several Americans rest on his shoulders,\" Erin Pelton, a spokesperson for the Corbett family, told CBS News.",
      "Corbett's wife, Anna Corbett, described the call with the president during an appearance on Fox News on Monday.",
      "\"He was very kind and empathetic, but what I heard him say is he's not bringing Ryan home, and that was just devastating,\" Anna Corbett said. She blasted Mr. Biden for refusing to agree to the Taliban's terms for a deal. \"It is not being taken and it is incredibly crushing to our family.\"",
      "She has launched a public campaign in recent days to urge the incoming administration to press for her husband's release, and she traveled to President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago residence in hopes of making an in-person plea to Trump. Neither Mr. Biden nor Trump have met with her yet.",
      "Anna Corbett did tell Fox News that Trump sent incoming national security adviser and current Florida Rep. Mike Waltz to meet with her. She said he spent more than an hour listening to her family's story. She expressed frustration that it took more than a year to get a similar meeting with the current national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "The Taliban have been demanding that the U.S. release Muhammed Rahim al-Afghani, who is being held in indefinite law-of-war detention at Guantanamo Bay. A source familiar with his case said the U.S. intelligence community and Pentagon oppose Rahim's release and could not guarantee that he no longer represented a threat to the U.S. However, the president could waive that if he determined it were in the U.S. interest to finalize a prisoner swap.",
      "Rahim was captured in Pakistan in 2007 by the CIA and was the last detainee sent to the Guantanamo prison facility by the Bush administration in 2008. He has never been charged with war crimes, but the periodic review board has deemed his continued detention a national security necessity. His 2016 intelligence profile describes him as a courier for al Qaeda.",
      "In its statement acknowledging the phone call, the White House also noted that Mr. Biden had been able to bring home U.S. citizens who had been detained before the U.S. exit from Afghanistan in 2021. Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi were detained after traveling to Afghanistan following the Taliban's return to power. That ascendance of the Taliban followed a diplomatic deal negotiated by the Trump administration for U.S. troops to withdraw and a surprisingly strong Taliban military offensive that caught the Biden administration off guard, leading to a hasty and chaotic U.S. evacuation. Unwilling to remain without U.S. troops, NATO forces also pulled out.",
      "The U.S. does not officially recognize the Taliban, with its horrific human rights record, as the legitimate government of Afghanistan but has been in contact with its leaders through U.S. agencies as well as via the Qatari government. Last weekend in Doha, Special Presidential Envoy Roger Carstens and NSC official Jen Daskal pressed for a deal with the Taliban to free the Americans.",
      "A U.S. official described the Doha meetings as unsuccessful but declined to detail which other individuals the Biden administration was willing to offer to the Taliban as part of a potential trade. The White House described the Biden efforts as continuing through the end of his term.",
      "Mr. Biden has dedicated much of his career to foreign policy, and that portion of his legacy is extremely important to him. In a speech Monday at the State Department, the president will describe the chaotic U.S. exit from Afghanistan, arguably his biggest foreign policy failure, as having successfully ended America's longest war.",

    "story": [
      "A descendant of one of Jack the Ripper's victims has demanded a new inquest into one of history's most notorious serial killers, after DNA evidence suggested the murderer was a Polish barber.",
      "The true identity of Jack the Ripper, whose grisly murders terrorized the murky slums of Whitechapel in east London in 1888, has been a mystery ever since.",
      "There have been dozens of suspects, from royalty and prime ministers down to bootmakers.",
      "After extracting DNA from a shawl recovered from the scene of one of the killings, Jack the Ripper sleuth Russell Edwards claimed in 2014 that the murderer was Aaron Kosminski, an emigre from Poland, who worked as a barber.",
      "The story goes that the shawl came from the murder scene of the Ripper's fourth victim, Catherine Eddowes, on September 30, 1888.",
      "At Edwards' request, Doctor Jari Louhelainen, a senior lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University, isolated seven small segments of DNA from blood stains on the shawl.",
      "They were matched with the DNA of Karen Miller, a direct descendant of Eddowes, confirming her blood was on the shawl.",
      "\"On the testing, the first result showed a 99.2% match. Since the DNA has two complementary strands, we went on and tested the other DNA strand, which game a perfect 100% match,\" Louhelainen told\u00a0the Liverpool Echo\u00a0newspaper.",
      "DNA from semen stains on the garment were matched with a descendant of Kosminski.",
      "Edwards has demanded an inquest into the unsolved killing, saying the DNA evidence warrants it.",
      "Miller backed the call in an interview with the Daily Mail published on Monday.",
      "\"The name Jack the Ripper has become sensationalized. It has gone down in history as this famous character,\" she told the paper. \"People have forgotten about the victims, who did not have justice at the time. Now we need this inquest to legally name the killer.\"",
      "Miller added: \"Having the real person legally named in a court which can consider all the evidence would be a form of justice for the victims.\"",
      "Kosminski's descendants have also supported the inquest, the Daily Mail reported. According to the newspaper, Kosminski's great-great-great-niece Amanda Poulos said: \"I'm more than happy to finally establish what really happened.\"",
      "Some have cast doubt on Edwards' findings.",
      "The research has not been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, meaning the claims cannot be independently verified or the methodology scrutinized.",
      "Under the law, it is up to the attorney general to approve a further inquest.",
      "Two years ago, then the attorney general, Michael Ellis, refused the request, saying there was not sufficient new evidence.",
      "Miller said on Monday the time was right to reopen the case.",
      "\"It would mean a lot to me, to my family, to a lot of people to finally have this crime solved,\" she added.",
      "Kosminski was born in Klodawa in central Poland on September 11, 1865.",
      "His family fled the imperial Russian anti-Jewish pogroms and emigrated to east London in the early 1880s. He lived close to the murder scenes.",
      "Some reports say he was taken in by the police to be identified by a witness who had seen him with one of the victims.",
      "Although a positive identification was made, the witness refused to give incriminating evidence, meaning the police had little option but to release Kosminski.",
      "He entered a workhouse in 1889, where he was described on admission as \"destitute.\" He was discharged later that year but soon ended up in a mental asylum.",
      "He died from gangrene in an asylum on March 24, 1919, and was buried three days later at East Ham Cemetery in east London.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, former FBI agent John Douglas referred to the homicides as \"lust murders,\" which means the killer attacked the genital areas of his victims. In Douglas' opinion, this was a way to act out his fantasy of domination, cruelty and mutilation of women.",

      "Two of the demonstrators forced to leave the chamber were male, before a female protester also stood up and yelled out in Spanish.",
      "She was quickly escorted from the room and the hearing promptly restarted.",

      "To which Rubio replied, \"Not yet,\" garnering laughs from the room.",
      "In another bipartisan moment rarely seen during Cabinet nomination hearings, Illinois Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth told a touching story from one of her first encounters with Rubio \u2014 a stark contrast to her questioning of Pete Hegseth the day prior.",
      "In 2018, not only was Duckworth relatively new to the upper chamber, but the soon-to-be new mom was also pushing the congressional body to change its rules and allow new parents to bring their infant onto the Senate floor during a vote.",

      "Though one area Senators may have hoped Rubio would have come out more definitively was over what continued support for Ukraine may look like and how the incoming Trump administration will handle the question of Ukraine becoming a NATO member.",
      "Both Ukraine and Russia have signaled they are open to negotiating a ceasefire. But securing a lasting peace deal could be difficult as Ukraine entering the NATO alliance has been deemed a non-negotiable by both Kyiv \u2014 who wants the alliance\u2019s security \u2014 and Moscow \u2014 which has fervently opposed Ukrainian NATO membership.",

      "The Pentagon watchdog\u2019s scathing 188-page review scrutinizes the secretary\u2019s hospitalizations in December 2023, January 2024 and February 2024 and puts the blame on Austin\u2019s team for communication lapses and failures to transfer authority.",
      "OIG noted the main role Austin\u2019s \"strong desire for privacy about his medical condition\" played in the breakdown of communications within the Pentagon, as well as between Defense Department and the White House and Congress.",

Additionally, according to the report, Austin told his personal security officer not to notify anyone about the incident.",
      "\"No one on Secretary Austin\u2019s staff knew the seriousness of his condition, including when his condition became worse and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on January 2,\" OIG noted in its report.",
      "On Jan. 3, 2024, Austin\u2019s chief of staff, Kelly Magsamen, texted the secretary\u2019s junior military assistant, who was in the hospital with the secretary at the time. In her message, Magsamen urged the secretary to be more forthcoming about his condition.",

He can\u2019t just go totally dark on his staff. \u2026 Please pass to him that we can\u2019t keep his hospitalization a secret forever. It\u2019s kind of big deal for him to be in the [SICU].

      "The OIG also found that on Feb. 11, 2024, when Austin was once again unexpectedly hospitalized, his authorities were not transferred \"until several hours later.\" In reference to this incident, the OIG noted that \"given the seriousness of his condition,\" Austin\u2019s authorities should have been transferred \"hours earlier than ultimately occurred.\"",

These improvements are not just an administrative necessity; they are an operational and national security imperative.\"",
      "Ultimately, the report found that the Department of Defense lacked a \"comprehensive\" plan for handing off duties in the event of the secretary\u2019s absence.",
      "After the report\u2019s release, a senior defense official admitted to reporters that Austin \"made a mistake,\" insisting \"there was no scandal\" and \"there was no cover up.\" The official also noted that \"at every moment, either the Secretary of Defense or the Deputy Secretary of Defense was fully prepared to support the president.\"",

      "The mayor's office responded to Torres' accusation by pointing out that despite the new shelter being opened, they are planning to close 46 migrant shelters across the city and reduce the total shelter bed count by 10,000 by June.

New York is a migrant sanctuary city and has a \"right to shelter\" law that requires the city to accommodate anyone seeking shelter who has no other option. However, in recent months, Adams has taken a different tone toward immigrants in the city and announced the closure of a string of migrant shelters. In last week's statement, Adams said the closures are part of the city\u2019s efforts to find \"more opportunities to save taxpayer money and turn the page on this unprecedented humanitarian crisis.\"",

      "The shelter\u2019s location \u2013 825 E. 141st St. \u2013 was renovated in 2017 and is near an infamous section of the Bronx called \"the Hub,\" which is known for having a high volume of open drug use and activity, including the use of heroin and fentanyl.

      "\"We believe the state has a responsibility to act quickly on issues that matter most to Tennesseans, and there is widespread support in the General Assembly and across Tennessee for a special session on the most pressing legislative priorities: the unified Education Freedom Act and a comprehensive relief package for Hurricane Helene and other disaster recovery efforts,\" they said. \"The majority of Tennesseans, regardless of political affiliation, have made it clear that they support empowering parents with school choice, and the best thing we can do for Tennessee students is deliver choices and public school resources without delay.\"",
      "The statement added: \"Hurricane Helene was an unprecedented disaster across rural, at-risk, and distressed communities that cannot shoulder the local cost share of federal relief funds on their own. The state has an opportunity and obligation to partner with these impacted counties and develop innovative solutions for natural disasters going forward.\"",
      "\"Finally, the American people elected President Trump with a mandate to enforce immigration laws and protect our communities, and Tennessee must have the resources ready to support the Administration on Day One,\" they said.",
      "\"Last year, Gov. Lee directed key state agencies to begin preparing for federal immigration policy implementation,\" Lee's press secretary, Elizabeth Lane Johnson, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"In this special session, we will ensure the state is best positioned to coordinate with federal, state, and local law enforcement to implement the Trump Administration's plan to enforce the federal immigration laws on the books.\"",
      "\"President Trump has made it clear that states will play a major role in partnering with his Administration to make our communities safer. Tennessee is heeding the call,\" she added.",
      "Lee, whose initial school choice proposal failed in the state legislature earlier last year, spoke to Fox News Digital in November upon introducing a second package aimed at increasing parental rights.",
      "After Trump's decisive election win, the governor argued that the political environment on the ground in Tennessee is not what it was months before when the first school choice proposal failed.\u00a0The election saw a wave of pro-school choice candidates win at the state level, and Trump succeeded in his bid for the White House. Lee told Fox News Digital that he agreed with Trump's promise to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, echoing the president-elect's concern over the federal bureaucracy becoming entrenched with gender and race ideology rather than learning.",

      "\"In this case, states certainly know best. We know best in Tennessee what our children need and how best to educate our kids. The parents of this state should be given a greater influence on how their kids are educated, and that will happen if the federal Department of Education is dismantled and those funds are delivered to states to be used in a more efficient and more effective way,\" Lee said at the time. \"President Trump has long believed that school choice is important for the people of this country and that education freedom is something that all Americans could have. He's talked about it. He campaigned on it.\"",

The first 10,000 scholarships would be set aside for low-income students whose parents might not otherwise afford to send their children to institutions other than the public schools in their districts.",
      "In addition to establishing Education Freedom Scholarships, Lee's office said the bill \"further invests in public schools and teachers by delivering teacher bonuses to recognize their unwavering commitment to student success, increasing K-12 facilities funding, and ensuring state funding to school districts will never decrease due to disenrollment.\" The governor and the General Assembly \"will maintain their commitment to public schools by further investing hundreds of millions of state dollars in the Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement (TISA) formula, and raising starting teacher pay,\" Lee's office said.",
      "The governor is also planning to invest more than $450 million in direct disaster relief.",

At that time, it was available for as much as $3,000 per month.",
      "Check Point says this malware evolved in September after being exposed. This time, its developers had \"stolen\" a string encryption algorithm from Apple\u2019s own XProtect antivirus engine, which replaced the plain text strings used in the original version. Since antivirus programs expect to see this kind of encryption from Apple\u2019s legitimate security tools, they weren\u2019t flagged as suspicious, allowing the BanShee to remain undetected and quietly steal data from targeted devices.",

It goes after data from browsers like Chrome, Brave, Edge and Vivaldi, as well as cryptocurrency wallet extensions. It even takes advantage of two-factor authentication (2FA) extensions to grab credentials. On top of that, it collects details about the device\u2019s software and hardware, as well as the external IP address.",

They set up fake repositories that looked like they hosted popular software, complete with stars and reviews, to seem trustworthy. These campaigns didn\u2019t just target macOS users with BanShee.

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links: Only download software from reputable sources such as the Mac App Store or official websites of trusted developers. Be wary of unsolicited emails or messages prompting you to download or install updates, especially if they contain links. Phishing attempts often disguise themselves as legitimate update notifications or urgent messages.",
      "3)\u00a0Keep your software updated: Ensure that both macOS and all installed applications are up to date. Apple frequently releases security patches and updates that address vulnerabilities. Enable automatic updates for macOS and your apps to stay protected without having to manually check for updates. If you need more help, see my\u00a0guide on keeping all your devices updated.",
      "4)\u00a0Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0To protect your Mac from malware, it\u2019s also crucial to use strong, unique passwords for all your accounts and devices. Avoid reusing passwords across different sites or services. A\u00a0password manager can be incredibly helpful here; it generates and stores complex passwords for you, making them difficult for hackers to crack.",
      "It also keeps track of all your passwords in one place and automatically fills them in when you log into accounts, so you don\u2019t have to remember them yourself. By reducing the number of passwords you need to recall, you\u2019re less likely to reuse them, which lowers the risk of security breaches. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5)\u00a0Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA for your important accounts, including your Apple ID, email and any financial services. This adds an extra step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "No device is immune to cyberattacks when a human operator is involved. Take the BanShee Stealer, for example. It managed to target Macs not due to weak cybersecurity measures by Apple but because it successfully tricked users into installing it and granting the required permissions. Most breaches, hacks and other cyberattacks stem from human error. This highlights the importance of maintaining basic cybersecurity hygiene.

    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 12:00:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reveals that hackers stole data from Gravy Analytics, a major seller of smartphone location data to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "When we talk about data privacy, tech giants like Google and Facebook are often blamed for using personal data to show ads and recommendations. Less discussed are the businesses whose entire business model revolves around collecting your data and selling it to other companies and governments. These companies often operate in legal gray areas, with the consent required to collect user data buried deep in the fine print.",
      "What\u2019s even more concerning is that these data brokers fail to adequately protect the data they collect. Last year, National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of individuals whose data it had harvested. Now, hackers have reportedly stolen data from Gravy Analytics, the parent company of Venntel, which has sold vast amounts of smartphone location data to the U.S. government.",

The compromise is massive, including sensitive location data that tracks precise smartphone movements, customer information and even internal infrastructure, according to a\u00a0404 Media report.",
      "The hackers are threatening to make the stolen data public. The files contain precise latitude and longitude coordinates of the phone and the time at which the phone was there. Some even indicate what country the data has been collected from.",
      "Hackers have claimed access to Gravy's systems since 2018. If true, this represents a serious security lapse on the company\u2019s part. It is baffling how companies that collect and sell user data (a practice that arguably shouldn\u2019t be allowed in the first place) failed to protect it from being leaked.",
      "404 Media also suggests that the hackers gained deep access to the company\u2019s infrastructure, including Amazon S3 buckets and server root access. The exposed customer list reportedly includes major companies like Uber, Apple and Equifax as well as government contractors like Babel Street.",

      "What this breach means for people",
      "This data breach highlights the serious security flaws in the location data industry. Companies like Gravy Analytics and Venntel have been profiting from collecting and selling sensitive location data, often without proper user consent. They've prioritized profit over security, and now the privacy of millions is at risk. This data could end up on black markets, endangering individuals, especially those in vulnerable situations, by making them targets for harassment or worse.",
      "The FTC's recent crackdown on Gravy, announced in December, underscores their negligence. The proposed order will prohibit these companies from selling or using location data, except in specific cases like national security or law enforcement. The implications are worrying. Sensitive locations like schools and workplaces could become easy targets for those with malicious intent.",

      "The Gravy Analytics breach serves as a sobering reminder of the vulnerabilities in the digital age. While it\u2019s impossible to control how every company handles data, you can take steps to minimize your exposure and protect your privacy. Here are five actionable tips to stay safe.",
      "1) Limit app permissions: Many apps request access to location data, contacts and more, even when it's not necessary for their functionality. Regularly review the permissions for apps on your smartphone and revoke access to anything that feels excessive. For instance, a weather app doesn\u2019t need access to your microphone or camera.",
      "2) Use a VPN:\u00a0Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your IP address and encrypt your internet activity, making it harder for data brokers and hackers to track your online behavior. A good VPN adds an extra layer of security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Opt out of data sharing where possible:\u00a0Some companies allow you to opt out of having your data collected or shared. Services like Your Ad Choices and privacy settings within platforms like Google can help you reduce the amount of data collected. Check for opt-out options with any apps or services you use frequently.",
      "4)\u00a0Avoid free apps that monetize data: Free apps often generate revenue by selling user data. Instead, consider paid versions of apps that explicitly prioritize privacy. Research the company behind the app to understand its data handling policies before downloading.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0Data removal services can help you regain some control over your personal information by identifying and removing it from people-search websites, data broker platforms and other online databases.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Companies that collect and sell user data pose a significant threat to privacy, and when they fail to protect this data, it often ends up in the hands of even worse actors. Cybercriminals, and even some governments, can exploit this information to target individuals. It is crucial to implement stringent repercussions for these companies when they fail in their duty to safeguard user data. A mere slap on the wrist is not enough. We need real accountability to deter negligence and protect individual privacy rights.",

      "13) Try out the new Passwords app",
      "I always stress the importance of using a password manager to store your passwords. Let\u2019s be honest, we all have a ton of apps and services that require an account and password. If you use the same password everywhere, you risk having your important info stolen by cybercriminals. But it\u2019s also impossible to come up with a unique password for every app and remember them all.",
      "Password managers make life easier by storing your passwords and filling them in when you log into apps. But they usually charge a monthly or yearly fee. That\u2019s where Apple\u2019s Passwords app comes in. It works just like a password manager but without the extra cost. Open the app from the App Library, and it\u2019ll keep your login details encrypted and synced across all your devices.",
      "While Apple's new Passwords app in iOS 18 offers a convenient and cost-free solution for password management, it's important to consider its limitations. These include its exclusivity to the Apple ecosystem, lack of compatibility with Android or Linux devices and limited functionality outside of Safari and Apple apps. For those seeking a more comprehensive password management solution that works across various browsers and apps, check out my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "German automaker Volkswagen isn't having a great time. The company is planning to cut capacity at five factories, reducing production by about 700,000 vehicles, while also laying off more than 35,000 workers in its home country. Now, reports suggest the company had a massive data leak at its subsidiary software company Cariad, which exposed personal data, including geolocation data, of around 800,000 EV owners online and accessible for months. Such information could be valuable to criminals for extortion purposes. What's interesting is that a hacker association informed the company about this data leak after receiving a tip from an anonymous hacker.",

      "What you need to know about the data leak",
      "As reported by Germany\u2019s Der Spiegel magazine, Volkswagen is facing a major data security issue after movement data from 800,000 electric cars and the personal contact information of their owners were left exposed on the internet. This data revealed sensitive details, such as the precise locations where cars were parked, including private locations like people\u2019s homes, government buildings and even questionable spots like brothels.",
      "The exposed data includes detailed movement patterns of these vehicles, allowing for the creation of comprehensive profiles of individuals' daily activities. This could be particularly concerning for public figures or anyone with privacy concerns.",
      "Several car brands under the Volkswagen group, including VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda, were affected by the breach, which exposed sensitive data across multiple countries. The information was stored on Amazon cloud servers without adequate protection, leaving it vulnerable for months before the issue was discovered.",
      "For around 466,000 of the 800,000 affected vehicles, the location data was detailed enough to map out drivers\u2019 daily routines. Spiegel reported that the list of affected users included German politicians, business leaders, the entire EV fleet used by Hamburg police and even suspected intelligence agents.",
      "The breach came to light when an anonymous hacker tipped off the Chaos Computer Club. While Volkswagen left the data easily accessible during this time, there is no indication so far that anyone misused or accessed it maliciously.",
      "We reached out to Volkswagen for comment but did not hear back by our deadline.",

      "How can this data leak affect you?",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is more than just a tech issue. It is a real concern for anyone who values their privacy. With precise location data out in the open, someone could figure out where you live, work or spend your free time. This information could be misused in many ways, from targeted scams where hackers pretend to be Volkswagen or its partners to trick you into giving up sensitive information, to more personal threats like stalking or harassment.",
      "Imagine someone knowing your daily routine or identifying places you visit that you would prefer to keep private. Visits to clinics, legal offices or other sensitive locations could expose you to embarrassment or blackmail.",
      "The breach also raises concerns for business leaders, government officials and military personnel as their movements linked to high-security or restricted areas could be exposed, increasing the risk of corporate espionage or national security threats. Moreover, when paired with other vulnerabilities, such as app credentials, hackers could potentially exploit the data to unlock or even control vehicles remotely.",

      "In light of the recent Volkswagen data breach, it is crucial to take proactive measures to safeguard your personal data. Here are 6 ways you can stay safe after this leak:",
      "1) Check your app settings:\u00a0Review the permissions and data-sharing settings in your car's companion app. Disable features that track or share your location if they are not essential for your use. Regularly update the app to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "2) Be alert to scams:\u00a0Keep an eye out for suspicious emails, messages or calls pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. Avoid clicking on links or sharing sensitive information without verifying the sender.",
      "3) Consider data opt-out options:\u00a0Many vehicles with online features allow you to limit or disable certain data-sharing functionalities. Check your car\u2019s settings to reduce the amount of personal data being collected.",
      "4) Strengthen your online accounts:\u00a0If you use the same email or password across multiple accounts, update them immediately. Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "5) Beware of snail mail scams: While most people focus on digital threats, physical mail scams can also follow a data breach like this. If your contact information was exposed, you might receive fraudulent letters pretending to be from Volkswagen or related services. These could ask for payments, personal details or even encourage you to visit fake websites.",
      "6) Install strong antivirus software: Ensure that you have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices, especially those connected to your vehicle or its apps. This can help protect you from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Volkswagen data leak is a glaring example of how companies need to take user data security more seriously. Exposing personal details and precise locations is not just a technical mistake. It is a massive breach of trust. While VW has patched the issue, the damage shows how important it is for businesses to be more responsible with the data they collect. People deserve to know their information is safe and used only when necessary. If companies cannot protect their customers\u2019 privacy, they risk losing their confidence altogether. It is time for the industry to step up and do better.",

The company may also be in violation of data privacy agreements it signed with school districts, as well as federal and state laws designed to safeguard student privacy. What\u2019s more concerning is that PowerSchool took nearly two weeks to notify its customers about the breach. Schools are now left scrambling to assess the full extent of the intrusion.

      "The free tier works for most people. I pay $20 a month for ChatGPT Plus. It\u2019s worth it to me for access to the better features and faster response times. Start with free. If you find yourself relying on your favorite AI tool regularly, consider upgrading. It is worth considering.",
      "A man is pictured working on an airplane and using a cellphone. (iStock)",

Examples: \"Limit your response to 250 words,\" \"Give me the list in bullet points,\" \"Format the results as a table,\" \"Use this data to create a bar chart.\"",
      "Remember, AI can\u2019t read your mind. It only knows what you tell it. Use \"do\" and \"don\u2019t\" in your prompts to get the results you want. Say you\u2019re cooking for friends, and some have allergies. Say, \"Create a recipe for six people. Do include protein, fruits, vegetables and carbs. Don\u2019t include dairy products, shellfish or nuts.\"",

      "\"Give me 10 more examples\": That\u2019s a prompt I use with ChatGPT all the time to make the chatbot a better brainstorming buddy. Some of its \"ideas\" are downright bad, but it might spark something creative in your brain, too.",
      "\"How can I make this better?\"\u00a0Add in anything you\u2019ve written \u2014 a blog post, a travel plan, a resume or even a heartfelt email. This prompt works wonders for polishing your work and pointing out improvements, like a personal editor at your fingertips.",

Instead, open a chatbot and say, \"Turn these notes into a professional, friendly email to my team.\" Paste your notes at the end and voila. Pro tip: Ask your bot of choice, \"Is there anything that needs more details?\" to fill in any missing info.",
      "Shortcut your inbox: When you get a really long email, open your AI chatbot of choice, and type in the prompt, \"Summarize this email for me. Tell me what I need to do, then write a thoughtful reply. Here is the email.\" Paste in the email and let AI do its magic.",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition parties moved Wednesday to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "Suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has reportedly been arrested over insurrection charges stemming from his ill-fated martial law declaration last month.",
      "Yoon's detention was reported Wednesday by Yonhap, one of the country's largest news outlets. A warrant for his arrest, initially requested after he failed to show up for questioning, has been out since Dec. 31.",
      "Police dispatched some 3,200 officers to the president's sprawling hillside estate in Seoul, according to Reuters, where he has spent weeks in hiding whilst surrounded by a personal security detail.",
      "Video shows officers closing in on Yoon's residence, according to Reuters, where hundreds of his supporters had already gathered to protest on his behalf. Earlier, they were reportedly seen pushing through a group of them.",

      "\"As I have repeatedly emphasized the need for prevention of physical conflict between state agencies,\" Acting President Choi Sang-mok said in a statement Wednesday. \"I will sternly hold those responsible if unfortunate events occur.\"",
      "Authorities are making a second attempt to detain suspended South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol following last month's martial law declaration. (South Korea Presidential Office via AP, File)",

      "ARREST WARRANT ISSUED FOR IMPEACHED SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT AS POLITICAL CRISIS DEEPENS",
      "The arrest warrant is the first ever to be levied against a sitting South Korean president. Yoon's warrant stems from his declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 out of apparent frustration with the opposition-dominated parliament's refusal to pass key items on his political agenda.",
      "The move was decried within South Korea and abroad, where analysts expressed shock at the sudden and unprecedented move in what is typically one of Asia's most stable democracies.",

    "title": "Dozens of survivors and dead pulled from abandoned South African mine as hundreds remain underground",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2025 17:06:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Using a cage-like device, South African rescuers have brought at least 60 bodies and 92 survivors to the surface from one of the country&apos;s deepest mines.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Months after South African authorities initially cut off supplies to miners working illegally in an abandoned gold mine, rescuers brought dozens of bodies and emaciated survivors to the surface Tuesday with hundreds more still believed to be underground, many of them dead and others too weak to come out on their own.",
      "At least 60 bodies and 92 survivors had been pulled from one of South Africa's deepest mines since Monday in a red cagelike device lowered thousands of feet underground, police said. Police are uncertain how many miners remain inside but said it is likely in the hundreds. Another nine bodies were brought out Friday in a community-led rescue effort, according to a group representing the miners.",
      "DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 13 IN SOUTH AFRICA MINING DISASTER",
      "The mine has been the scene of a tense standoff between police, miners and members of the local community since authorities launched an operation in November to force the miners out by cutting off food and water from the surface for a period of time. At the time, a Cabinet minister said the aim was to \"smoke them out\" and the government would not send help because they were \"criminals.\"",
      "But that tactic has been fiercely criticized by civic groups and the community, and the South African government is under scrutiny for the way it has dealt with the issue at the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine, where more than 100 miners are believed to have died underground of starvation or dehydration, according to the group representing them.",
      "Rescue workers assist an illegal miner who has been trapped deep in an abandoned gold mine for months, in Stilfontein, South Africa, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Themba Hadebe)",
      "Authorities, who removed the ropes and pulley system miners used to enter and to lower supplies, say the survivors are able to come out but refuse to because of fear of arrest. That has been disputed by the civic groups, which won a court case to force authorities to allow food, water and medicine to be sent down to the miners. But they say the supplies aren\u2019t enough and many of the miners are dying of starvation and unable to climb out because the shaft is too steep.",
      "Residents desperately waiting for news of family members gathered at the mine Tuesday near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, some holding placards criticizing authorities for their response. One sign said there had been a \"Sacrifice at Stilfontein\" while some handcuffed survivors were led away in a line by police.",
      "The community organized its own rescue operation on Friday before the official effort by authorities began Monday. They say a proper rescue operation should have been launched months ago.",
      "\"We are happy that this operation is happening, even though we believe that if it was done earlier, we wouldn\u2019t even have one dead person,\" said Mzukisi Jam, the regional chairperson of the South African National Civics Organization, an umbrella for civic and rights groups.",
      "Authorities have grappled with informal mining for years",
      "Illegal mining is common in parts of gold-rich South Africa where companies close down mines that are no longer profitable, leaving groups of informal miners to enter them illegally in a search for leftover deposits.",
      "Large groups of miners often go underground for months to maximize their profits, taking food, water, generators and other equipment with them, but also relying on others in their group on the surface to send down more supplies.",
      "Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe visited the site Tuesday and said that more than 1,500 miners who resurfaced from the Buffelsfontein mine have been arrested since authorities began a larger crackdown on illegal mining in late 2023. He said the vast majority were foreign nationals from neighboring countries.",
      "Police have also doubled down on their assertion that the miners who are still underground aren't coming out because they are afraid of being arrested.",
      "Activists said the only way out is for miners to make a dangerous trek to another shaft, which can take days, and crawl out there, but many are too weak or ill to climb out. The mine is 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) deep with multiple shafts, many levels and a maze of tunnels. The group representing the miners said there are numerous groups in various parts of the mine.",
      "\"The last time I spoke to my brother was in July, when he told us that he is going underground,\" said Zinzi Tom, a sister of one of the miners who remained underground. \"We had not heard anything from him, but yesterday one of the miners who surfaced said he saw him about two weeks ago. Apparently he is very sick and he is struggling to survive.\"",
      "Cellphone videos emerge from underground",
      "The Mining Affected Communities United in Action group, which took authorities to court in December to force them to allow supplies to be sent down to the miners, released two cellphone videos that they said were from underground and showed dozens of dead bodies of miners wrapped in plastic. A spokesman for the group said \"a minimum\" of 100 miners had died.",
      "The cellphone videos purportedly from the depths of the mine are filmed by a man who can be heard saying, \"This is hunger. People are dying because of hunger,\" as he records emaciated-looking men sitting on the damp floor of the mine. He adds: \"Please help us. Bring us food or take us out.\"",
      "The rescue operation will go on for 10 days and authorities would then reassess, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu said. Police also said that the survivors who had been brought to the surface will be arrested and charged with illegal mining and trespassing after receiving medical attention.",
      "Authorities made clear their approach when South African Cabinet Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters in November that the government would not help the miners, who they consider criminals.",

      "\"We are not sending help to criminals,\" she said. \"We are going to smoke them out. They will come out.\"",

Notably, this was the second meeting between officials from New Delhi and Kabul in just two months, indicating both countries' readiness to step up diplomatic engagement.",
      "\"We shouldn\u2019t overstate the impact of Pakistan\u2019s tensions with the Taliban on India\u2019s stepped up engagement with the Taliban.

India has been developing the Chabahar Port to enable goods to bypass ports in its rival, Pakistan.

India and Pakistan are long-standing rivals, having fought three wars over Kashmir since both countries gained independence in 1947. This meeting also takes place amid deteriorating relations between the Taliban regime and Pakistan, once considered friendly neighbors, as cross-border violence escalates.",

      "The talks occurred just days after India \"unequivocally\" condemned Pakistani airstrikes in Afghanistan in late December. These rare airstrikes resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, including women and children. Pakistani officials claimed the strikes targeted militants of the Pakistani Taliban.

Although no foreign government, including India, has officially recognized the Taliban administration since it swept to power in 2021, India reopened its embassy in Kabul less than a year after the Taliban's return to power.",

The weakening of Iran, due to conflicts in the Middle East and internal issues, has diminished its influence over the Taliban. At the same time, Russia, one of India's closest allies, is moving toward recognizing the Taliban government in Afghanistan, even calling the group a partner in combating terrorism. Moscow perceives a significant security threat from Islamist militant groups across countries from Afghanistan to the Middle East, especially after losing Bashar al-Assad in Syria.",

      "The festival is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at the confluence of three sacred rivers that dates to at least medieval times. Hindus believe that the mythical Saraswati river once flowed from the Himalayas through Prayagraj, meeting there with the Ganges and the Yamuna.",
      "Bathing takes place every day, but on the most auspicious dates, naked, ash-smeared monks charge toward the holy rivers at dawn. Many pilgrims stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day.",
      "\"We feel peaceful here and attain salvation from the cycles of life and death,\" said Bhagwat Prasad Tiwari, a pilgrim.",
      "The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons.

A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day.",

      "At least 400 million people \u2014 more than the population of the United States \u2014 are expected in Prayagraj over the next 45 days, according to officials. That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year.",

There are only about 160 in operation around the world, each one constructed by a single Canadian company based on a design that has barely changed in 55 years.",
      "\u201cIt is a rugged, reliable and very tough aircraft,\u201d said Neil Sweeney, vice president of corporate affairs at De Havilland Aircraft, the planes\u2019 manufacturer, which is based in Calgary.",
      "Super Scoopers get their name from their ability to pick up 6,000 liters from bodies of water and drop them in just 12 seconds on wildfires burning nearby, he said. It\u2019s a specialized task that\u2019s becoming more in demand as a warming climate contributes to bigger, hotter, more frequent blazes that are often difficult to control.",
      "Unlike most other firefighting aircraft that must return to base after each drop, Super Scoopers can fly continuously for three to four hours, returning to ingest and release water on a fire repeatedly. Their powerful engines let pilots slow down and execute drops with precision, Sweeney said, and the planes have proved capable of operating in \u201csome of the worst conditions possible,\u201d including high winds.",
      "So losing just one Super Scooper even temporarily can hamper firefighting operations when every hour is critical. Thursday\u2019s drone crash, which punched a hole in the plane\u2019s left wing, was a close call, Sweeney said. The aircraft landed safely and no one was injured, but it could\u2019ve been much worse if the drone had hit elsewhere, he added.",
      "The incident nonetheless grounded the plane for days, keeping it out of action as authorities struggled to respond to shifting winds over the weekend. It was expected to fly again Tuesday, according to Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone, but officials said they\u2019re taking the incident seriously and the FBI is seeking information about the drone\u2019s operator.",
      "The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, meanwhile, has urged people to respect restricted airspace. \u201cThere could have been injuries,\u201d said Scott McLean, an information officer for Cal Fire. \u201cThere could have been fatalities.\u201d",
      "So far, there aren\u2019t many alternatives to Super Scoopers. While tech startups are racing to build bigger, more powerful firefighting drones, most are still under development. Experts say it could take some time before effective, affordable autonomous aircraft are in widespread use, given the logistical hurdles and safety regulations that need to be cleared first.",
      "De Havilland mainly focuses on special-mission aircraft. The company has been making the current Super Scooper model since 2015, when former manufacturer Bombardier sold the program to De Havilland. The company is now working on producing its first order of 22 new Super Scoopers, or the De Havilland Canadair 515, for fire departments in Europe, Sweeney said.",
      "Earlier versions \u2014 the CL-215, produced in the 1970s and \u201980s, and the CL-415, produced from the \u201990s through 2015 \u2014 are still in use as well. Sweeney estimated about 70 of the Super Scoopers currently in action are the older CL-215 model. He expects more fire departments will soon seek replacements as many contend with more intense, longer-lasting fire seasons, and as other places that don\u2019t typically experience wildfires begin to do so.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing significant demand around the world,\u201d Sweeney said, adding that De Havilland hopes to ramp up production to nine or 10 planes each year.",
      "Most Super Scoopers in the U.S. are owned by Montana-based Bridger Aerospace. With six planes, the company holds the largest private Super Scooper fleet in the world and leases the aircraft to fire departments. Over the weekend, Bridger sent a CL-415, which had been undergoing winter maintenance, to California.",
      "Other Super Scoopers operating in the U.S. are on loan from Canada, like the Quebec 1 that was hit by the drone in L.A. Officials there have leased a pair of CL-415 planes from the government of Quebec each fire season for the past 31 years.",
      "That partnership reflects the long history of cross-border resource-sharing for wildfire control, Sweeney said, adding that he hopes it will continue even as the challenges grow.",
      "The incoming U.S. administration could throw a wild card into this arrangement, with President-elect Donald Trump already threatening tariffs of up to 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico. He also suggested this month that he wanted to make Canada the 51st state, adding to diplomatic tensions that factored into a leadership change atop the country\u2019s ruling party.",
      "For now, though, \u201cthere\u2019s a high degree of cooperation worldwide, but especially between North American states and provinces when we have severe wildfires,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cOur American friends send equipment, send personnel up to us, and vice versa.\u201d"

      "The finale of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris featured a memorable televised \u201chandover\u201d to the next host city, Los Angeles. Billie Eilish and the Red Hot Chili Peppers performed in front of a quintessentially Californian backdrop: sandy beach, palm trees, blue ocean and crystal clear skies.",
      "But that blissful image has been ruptured in recent days as parts of Los Angeles were engulfed in flames, reducing homes and businesses across the sprawling metropolis to smoldering heaps of ash and rubble, most calamitously in the Pacific Palisades and the community of Altadena.",
      "It\u2019s unlikely the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles will be moved \u2014 and so far none of the marquee arenas, stadiums or athlete housing complexes have been damaged by the flames. But the fires have nonetheless cast a shadow over the next installment of the Games.",
      "The task facing the city and the organizers who successfully brought the Games to the West Coast is no small feat: rebuild and rebound in time to host some 15 million people for the 17-day sports extravaganza.",
      "At least one top official is confident the City of Angels will be back on its feet in time for the festivities. Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA28, a private fundraising and organizing group behind the Games, touted the city\u2019s tenacity in the face of obstacles.",
      "\u201cLos Angeles is defined by its resilience and determination,\u201d Wasserman said in a statement. \u201cThe strength of our communities and our unity in tough times make this city extraordinary, and when Los Angeles welcomes the world in 2028, our spirit will shine brighter than ever before.\u201d",
      "Wasserman added that LA28\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d was \u201censuring our community has the resources it needs and that our heroic first responders are fully supported in keeping people safe.\u201d",
      "When asked how the wildfires might affect preparations for the Games, a spokeswoman for Mayor Karen Bass did not directly reply but emphasized her administration's commitment to handling the emergency.",
      "Gabby Maarse said Bass was \u201claser focused on keeping Angelenos safe and protecting property. She is securing federal, state and local resources needed to continue fighting these fires and is moving forward on an all-of-the-above plan for recovery.\u201d",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said he envisions a 21st century \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to revive the parts of Los Angeles \u201cravaged by this disaster.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy humble position, and it\u2019s not just being naively optimistic, that only reinforces the imperative [of] moving quickly, doing it in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation,\u201d he said.",
      "Newsom also said the crisis creates an opportunity for the incoming administration to lend a hand.",
      "\u201cPresident of the United States, Donald Trump, to his credit, was helpful in getting the Olympics to the United States of America, to get it down here in L.A. We thank him for that. This is an opportunity for him to shine, for this country to shine, for California and this community to shine,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The 2028 Games will be spread throughout Southern California and stretch as far south as Temecula \u2014 about 90 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles \u2014 and as far east as Oklahoma City, about 1,300 miles away, where softball and canoe slalom will be held.",
      "Track and field and the opening ceremony are set for the historic L.A. Memorial Coliseum, while swimming figures to be a show-stopping event at SoFi Stadium, home of the Rams and the Chargers in nearby Inglewood.",
      "In the coming years, LA28 organizers and municipal officials might find themselves competing for construction resources with private businesses and homeowners looking to rebuild. It\u2019s likely that contractors and supplies will be pushed to the limit, and that\u2019s before they factor in the temporary infrastructure required for the Games.",
      "You\u2019d have to go back more than a century to find another Olympics that was changed because of a natural disaster. Jeremy Fuchs, the author of a 2021 book about the history of the Olympics, pointed to one notable example from almost 120 years ago. Rome had been set to host the 1908 Summer Games. But after the deadly and violent eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1906, Italian funds were diverted to support Rome\u2019s recovery.",
      "The 1908 Games were moved to London, though Rome got another chance in the summer of 1960.",
      "One instance of the Games progressing in the wake of a recent catastrophe was when athletes descended on London in late July 1948, a little more than three years after the end of World War II.",
      "The 1948 Olympics were known as the \u201cAusterity Games\u201d as rationing and other wartime restrictions were still in place.",
      "\u201cI very much doubt that L.A. 2028 will be comparable to the war-diminished 1920 and 1948 Games, the fire damage notwithstanding,\u201d said John Hoberman, a University of Texas professor of cultural history who specializes in sports.",
      "The Los Angeles wildfires have so far burned dangerously close to Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, local venues set for soccer and golf in 2028.",
      "Hoberman said he couldn\u2019t fathom the International Olympic Committee pulling the games from Los Angeles, short of more once-in-a-lifetime mass tragedies.",
      "\u201cIt would take another catastrophe for the IOC to pull the games, which is a hugely political action in any case,\u201d he said.",
      "In a post on X on Sunday, IOC President Thomas Bach said the governing body was \u201cin full solidarity with the citizens of Los Angeles and full of admiration for the tireless work of the firefighters and the security forces.\u201d",
      "\u201cCurrently the full focus must be on the fight against the fires and the protection of the people and property,\u201d he added. \u201cWe have also learned that a great Olympian, Gary Hall Jr., has lost his medals in the fire. The IOC will provide him with replicas.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "After Meta and its CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a series of changes that shifted the company and its policies to the right ahead of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term, some users are fleeing the company\u2019s platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "In the barrage of changes made in recent weeks, the company ended its third-party fact-checking program in the United States and said it would pull back on content moderation around political discourse. Instead, Meta will use a community notes system similar to Elon Musk\u2019s X. Updates to Meta\u2019s\u00a0policy on hateful conduct include that LGBTQ people can now be called mentally ill because of their identities. Meta also disbanded its diversity, equity and inclusion team.",
      "Zuckerberg isn\u2019t the only Big Tech billionaire currying favor with the incoming president. Musk and Jeff Bezos will both be seated in prominent spots at Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday. But Meta\u2019s changes, along with Zuckerberg\u2019s personal appeals to Trump, have caused a cascade of reactions among its users.",
      "NBC News reviewed hundreds of posts and comments across various social media platforms that said users would delete their Meta accounts, stop posting or boycott the company in response to the changes. The exodus is reminiscent of when X (formerly Twitter) users left the platform in large numbers after the 2024 election.",
      "\u201cI no longer feel safe to post on either platform as a queer Chicana woman,\u201d said Marie Valencia, a full-time artist who had more than 20,000 followers on Facebook and Instagram before she stopped posting. The term Chicana refers to American women of Mexican descent. \u201cI have seen a steady stream of folks abandoning their profiles as well, especially in the last couple weeks as Meta has dismantled DEI and speech protections for those most vulnerable online.\u201d",
      "Valencia has moved to posting on Bluesky, an alternative to X, as well as a platform for Latina women called Amigahood. \u201cMeta will become another X,\u201d Valencia said.",
      "Cord Jefferson, director of Academy Award best picture nominee \u201cAmerican Fiction,\u201d announced Sunday that he was leaving Instagram, but would remain active on Tumblr.",
      "\u201cSo many things are getting bleaker and grosser by the day. And while we can\u2019t place the blame for all of it at the feet of tech oligarchs, we can place the blame for a lot of it at the feet of tech oligarchs,\u201d Jefferson wrote on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m doing what little I can to shut the increasingly stupid ideas that shape online spaces like this out of my life.\u201d",
      "Some people have abandoned some of Meta\u2019s platforms while continuing to use others. Stanford University law professor Mark Lemley, who represents Meta in a copyright dispute involving artificial intelligence, announced Monday that he would be dropping the company as a client and reconsidering his use of Meta\u2019s platforms.",
      "\u201cI have struggled with how to respond to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook\u2019s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness,\u201d Lemley wrote. \u201cWhile I have thought about quitting Facebook, I find great value in the connections and friends I have here, and it doesn\u2019t seem fair that I should lose that because Zuckerberg is having a mid-life crisis.\u201d",
      "Lemley said he deactivated his account on Threads, Meta\u2019s X alternative, and that he will no longer buy products from ads he sees on Facebook or Instagram. Instead, he wrote that he will \u201cgo separately to the website to make sure Facebook doesn\u2019t get any credit for the purchase.\u201d",
      "The people leaving Meta still make up a small percentage of its overall user base. Close to 2 out of 3 people in the United States are on Facebook. There are almost 170 million Instagram accounts in the U.S. and almost 100 million accounts on WhatsApp. A weeklong \u201cLights Out\u201d boycott of Meta platforms starting Jan. 19 attracted a few hundred likely participants in a Facebook group.",
      "Some users have said they feel trapped on Meta platforms, especially WhatsApp, because they use the services to communicate with family members, friends and personal networks. Others have built platforms as influencers or for organizations and small businesses.",
      "Stacy Kess, founder of the nonprofit news organization Equal Access Public Media, told NBC News that she was \u201cdisheartened\u201d to see other people and organizations in the disability community continue to post on Meta platforms after the policy on hateful conduct was updated to allow calling LGBTQ people mentally ill.",
      "\u201cI just saw so many people still actively posting on Instagram, and I wondered how many of them knew about the policy change,\u201d Kess said. \u201cThat should be a hard line for both the disability and the LGBTQ community.\u201d",
      "Equal Access Public Media has accounts on Facebook, Instagram and Threads, which issued statements concerning the policy change Tuesday that said \u201cEAPM condemns this policy allowing dehumanizing and ableist language. We will continue to post elsewhere.\u201d The organization, which is raising funds to produce accessible news products in video, audio, American Sign Language and simplified English, has its largest following on Bluesky.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 22:50:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Because the artificial dye is prohibited in the E.U. and elsewhere, many food and beverage makers already have recipes without it that they can use for U.S consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Food safety advocates cheered the news that U.S. regulators are banning Red No. 3 \u2014 and said they don\u2019t anticipate any hiccups in quickly removing the artificial dye from America\u2019s grocery shelves.",
      "Red No. 3 gives thousands of foods, beverages and sweets their cherry-red hue. On Wednesday, following decades of concerns over the additive\u2019s safety, the Food and Drug Administration announced it would ban its use starting in 2027.",
      "Those who petitioned to have Red No. 3 prohibited said there\u2019s no reason why it can\u2019t be taken out of products sooner. It has long been banned in the European Union and some other countries, meaning many companies that sell foods and beverages overseas already have recipes that they can easily swap in for American consumers.",
      "Plus, in 2023, California became the first state to pass a law forbidding Red No. 3 from products sold there. That ban, also set to take effect in 2027, has been expected to have a nationwide effect on manufacturers, which were unlikely to reformulate recipes just for Californians.",
      "\u201cCompanies have been on alert over this,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, president and executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group that petitioned the FDA in 2022 to end the use of Red No. 3. \u201cThey\u2019ve had plenty of time to think through this problem and to come up with alternatives.\u201d",
      "According to the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy health organization that joined the Center for Science in the Public Interest\u2019s petition, Red No. 3 is in approximately 3,000 products sold in the United States, including store-bought baked goods, seasonal candies, strawberry meal replacement shakes and more.",
      "First approved for use in food more than a century ago, Red No. 3 is made from petroleum and was banned from cosmetics in 1990 after a study found evidence that the dye caused cancer in rats exposed to it at high doses. It was allowed to remain in food, however, even as places such as the E.U. banned it in 1994 (except in cocktail cherries) and as evidence grew that it was carcinogenic to animals.",
      "Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat who introduced the California legislation that banned Red No. 3 in his state, said outlawing the colorant won\u2019t result in any products being removed from U.S. supermarkets. He said it would just require minor recipe reformulations, many of which are already being implemented in other countries.",
      "\u201cThere are many readily available natural alternatives. The companies know this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re making the same versions of products we know and love here in the United States in other countries, without the harmful dyes.\u201d",
      "Common alternatives to synthetic red food dyes include beet juice and pomegranate juice \u2014\u00a0 natural options that companies have shied away from because they perceive them as more costly, said consumer protection and environmental attorney Vineet Dubey, of the Los Angeles-based Custodio & Dubey LLP law firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper to use these artificial dyes. That\u2019s why these companies use them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re allowed to do so in the interest of profits, they\u2019re going to use the cheapest material.\u201d",
      "But Gabriel said research for his legislation concluded otherwise.",
      "\u201cAs we presented this bill, working it through the Legislature, we actually showed that in most cases, the safer ingredients are actually cheaper,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the price of any food to increase.\u201d",
      "Food manufacturers said they would comply with the FDA\u2019s ban on Red No. 3. Ferrara, the maker of Brach candy corn, which contains Red No. 3, said that it began phasing out the dye in early 2023 and that less than 10% of its portfolio of products currently have it.",
      "\u201cWe are on track to eliminate the food coloring from remaining products by the end of 2026,\u201d Ferrara said in an email. \u201cAll of our products are safe to consume and are manufactured using only FDA-approved ingredients.\u201d",
      "Just Born, the maker of the Easter marshmallow candy Peeps, said it stopped using Red No. 3 after last Easter.",
      "\u201c\u200b\u200bJust Born has always evolved with new developments and consumer preferences. We have removed Red #3 from all PEEPS products,\u201d it said in an email Wednesday to NBC News.",
      "The Consumer Brands Association, a trade group, said food safety is the top priority for companies, adding in a statement from senior vice president of product policy and federal affairs Sarah Gallo that \u201cfood and beverage companies will continue to follow the latest science and comply with all food safety regulations to ensure safe and available choices for consumers.\u201d",
      "The International Association of Color Manufacturers, which represents the color additives industry, maintained that Red No. 3 was safe for consumption, arguing in a statement that the ban was based on evidence of cancer in animals, not people. Nonetheless, the FDA says it cannot authorize food additives that have been found to cause cancer in either humans or animals.",
      "The FDA is not prohibiting other artificial dyes that have been associated with separate health concerns, such as hyperactivity and behavioral issues in children, including Red 40. Lurie said there is a possibility that some manufacturers simply swap Red No. 3 for Red 40.",
      "Regardless, removing Red No. 3 is a \u201cbig win\u201d for consumers, said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the Environmental Working Group.",
      "\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be hard for companies to do,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cMany of the same multinational food companies that produce products in the U.S. are also selling in Europe and have found ways to comply with the ban in Europe and still sell brightly colored red foods that are attractive in those markets, and have managed to do it without Red 3,\u201d she added."

    "summary": "TikTok is preparing to potentially make the app unavailable to its 170 million American users on Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok is preparing to potentially make the app unavailable to its 170 million American users on Sunday, the same day a U.S. ban is set to go into effect, according to a person with knowledge of the company\u2019s planning who spoke with NBC News.",
      "A law signed by President Joe Biden in April requires TikTok to divest from its Chinese ownership and sell to a U.S. company or it will be shut down. If the Supreme Court declares the law unconstitutional before then, TikTok can continue to exist as it is today.",
      "But a final decision has not been made by TikTok on what will happen if the Supreme Court rules against the company,\u201d according to the person with knowledge of the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Active conversations \u2014 including phone calls and meetings \u2014 were ongoing as of midday on Wednesday, the person said.",
      "A Tuesday report from The Information said if the justices uphold the law, the app will go dark rather than allow people already on the app to continue using it, citing two unnamed sources it said were familiar with TikTok\u2019s plans.",
      "Another option being discussed, according to the person who spoke with NBC News, is the potential for content to still be viewable in TikTok for users who have the application, though the app would no longer receive updates. It would be unavailable for new downloads in any app stores in the U.S., and the app would stop working over time because it would not be able to receive bug fixes and updates.",
      "Noel Francisco, an attorney for TikTok, told the Supreme Court on Friday that to his understanding the app would \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the company lost the case. \u201cEssentially, the platform shuts down,\u201d Francisco said.",
      "That is what happened in India when TikTok was banned there on June 29, 2020. Nikhil Pahwa, who founded the tech policy publication MediaNama in India, told NBC News that the app shut down the night the ban went into effect.",
      "\u201cBy morning, we found that TikTok wasn\u2019t accessible,\u201d Pahwa said. \u201cSo the effect was immediate. It was just \u2014 one evening access was just cut off. Users had nowhere to go. Brands that were advertising on TikTok had nowhere to go.\u201d",
      "For Americans visiting India, opening the TikTok app on their phone results in a notification that says \u201cOur services are not available in your country or region.\u201d Pahwa said that for Indian users, the mobile app doesn\u2019t work and clicking on a TikTok link on a desktop computer results in \u201ca simple landing page that says that the app is no longer available in India.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had 200 million internet users in India at that time, and so when the ban happened, they were taken aback, they didn\u2019t know what to do. They had to find somewhere to go,\u201d he said. \u201cOver the years, what\u2019s happened is that Instagram emerged as the one that won. It\u2019s where brands have migrated, it\u2019s where users have built profiles. Many users weren\u2019t able to recreate the success they had on TikTok.\u201d",
      "Within two months of the TikTok ban in India, Instagram rolled out its TikTok competitor Reels and YouTube released its competitor Shorts. They are also the primary alternative platforms for short-form video content in the U.S., although Americans have flocked to a Chinese app called RedNote in recent days, pushing it to the top of Apple\u2019s App Store. India has banned almost 500 Chinese apps so far, Pahwa said. He said he is unable to access TikTok with a virtual private network or VPN, which has been floated as a way to get around the ban by some U.S. users.",
      "TikTok isn\u2019t just a source for entertainment. It\u2019s a place where many users make money. Some of them have full-time careers based on TikTok, while companies also use TikTok for marketing. Whether the app goes dark immediately or keeps working but degrades over time will affect how creators and brands use the platform.",
      "Will Trowbridge, the CEO of creative agency Saylor, works with clients like the Walt Disney Company on TikTok content. Saylor has also worked with NBCUniversal, the company that owns NBC News. Trowbridge said that even if TikTok doesn\u2019t immediately go away on Jan. 19, remaining available on phones that already have the app downloaded, at least one of his clients doesn\u2019t want to post anymore. Some are concerned that the app would become more prone to security risks, like hacking, if it isn\u2019t able to receive updates or support.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re just stopping because they don\u2019t want to risk it, and they don\u2019t want to be part of that kind of decline of the app,\u201d Trowbridge said. \u201cEveryone has an action plan. They don\u2019t want to talk about it, because they don\u2019t want to face the reality of what it would mean.\u201d"

      "The Department of Transportation on Wednesday sued\u00a0Southwest Airlines, alleging the carrier operated chronically delayed flights, and fined\u00a0Frontier Airlines\u00a0for late-arriving flights.",
      "The lawsuit follows a\u00a0$2 million DOT fine\u00a0on\u00a0JetBlue Airways\u00a0for similar allegations.",
      "The lawsuit and fines\u00a0come at the end of the Biden administration, which has taken a harder line\u00a0toward consumer protections than previous administrations.",
      "The DOT said that Southwest\u2019s flights from Chicago Midway International Airport to Oakland, California, and from Baltimore to Cleveland arrived late nearly 200 times between April and August 2022.",
      "The DOT said each flight was chronically delayed for five consecutive months and that Southwest was responsible for more than 90% of the disruptions.",
      "It defines a flight as chronically delayed if it is flown at least 10 times a month and arrives more than 30 minutes late more than half of the time. The calculation includes cancellations and diversions.",
      "\u201cWhen an airline knows that a particular flight is consistently late, it is essential that the airline adjusts its schedule,\u201d the DOT said in its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Oakland, California. \u201cBut on many occasions, Southwest has chosen not to make such adjustments, and instead has continued to market its flights using unrealistic schedules. By doing so, Southwest has caused significant harm to its customers.\u201d",
      "In response, Southwest said it \u201cis disappointed that DOT chose to file a lawsuit over two flights that occurred more than two years ago.\u201d",
      "The carrier said that since the DOT issued its chronicallyd elayed flight policy in 2009, the airline operated more than 20 million flights with no violations of the policy. \u201cAny claim that these two flights represent an unrealistic schedule is simply not credible when compared with our performance over the past 15 years,\u201d Southwest said in a statement.",
      "Separately, the DOT fined budget carrier Frontier $650,000 for operating chronically delayed flights, though it added that $325,000 would be suspended if the airline doesn\u2019t operate any repeatedly delayed flights over the next three years. Frontier declined to comment.",

    "story": [
      "This year, for the first time in roughly five years, borrowers who have defaulted on their federal student loan debt will face collection activity, including\u00a0the garnishment of their wages\u00a0and\u00a0retirement benefits.",
      "In a new U.S. Department of Education memo obtained by CNBC, a top official lays out for the first time details of when garnishments may resume \u2014 in some cases, as early as this summer.",
      "The memo, dated days before the Trump administration takes over, details steps the Biden administration has taken to stave off a default crisis among federal student loan borrowers. It outlines strategies for the department to help student loan borrowers stay current as collection efforts resume this year.",
      "\u201cIt is critical to continue the initiatives and fully implement the actions outlined in this memo, as the Department plans to resume default penalties and mandatory collections later this year,\u201d U.S. Undersecretary of Education James Kvaal\u00a0writes in the memo\u00a0addressed to Denise Carter, acting chief operating officer for Federal Student Aid.",
      "There were around 7.5 million federal student loan borrowers in default, the\u00a0Education Department\u00a0said\u00a0in 2022. That grim figure has led to comparisons with\u00a0the 2008 mortgage crisis.",
      "Borrowers could face Social Security offsets by August",
      "After the Covid-era pause on federal student loan payments expired in September 2023, the Biden administration offered borrowers a 12-month\u00a0\u201con-ramp\u201d to repayment. During that time, they were shielded from most of the consequences of falling behind on their payments. The relief period expired on\u00a0Sept. 30, 2024.",
      "Now federal student loan borrowers in default may see their wages garnished starting in October of this year, according to the Education Department. Meanwhile, Social Security benefit offsets could resume as early as August.",
      "The Department of Education memo directs its Federal Student Aid office to continue the Biden administration\u2019s work to avoid defaults.",
      "That includes making it easier for borrowers to enroll in affordable repayment plans, such as letting borrowers authorize the department to obtain their income information from the IRS and to automatically enroll borrowers in an income-driven repayment plan if they become 75 days delinquent on their loans. (IDR plans base a borrower\u2019s monthly bill on their discretionary income and family size, and some are left with a $0 monthly bill. Any remaining debt is canceled after a certain period, typically 20 or 25 years.)",
      "Borrowers should also be \u201cscreened for other forgiveness opportunities before they formally default,\u201d the memo says.",
      "The memo also encourages the Education Department to explore options for increasing the current interest rate incentive to get borrowers to sign up for automatic payments to their student loan servicer. As of now, borrowers can typically get an 0.25 percentage point reduction in their interest rate by doing so.",
      "Fewer consequences on defaulted student loans",
      "Later this year, for the first time, borrowers in default will be able to enroll in the\u00a0Income-Based Repayment\u00a0plan \u201cand have a pathway to forgiveness,\u201d the memo says. Currently, federal student loan borrowers need to exit default before they can access any of the income-driven repayment plans, including the IBR.",
      "According to the memo, the Biden administration has eliminated most collection fees on federal student loans.",
      "In early 2024, it also took steps to protect a higher amount of people\u2019s Social Security benefits from the department\u2019s collection powers. When the consequences of defaults resume, those with a monthly Social Security benefit under $1,883 can protect those benefits from offset, compared with the current protected amount of $750 in place today.",
      "\u201cAvailable data suggest that these actions will effectively halt Social Security offsets for more than half of affected borrowers and reduce the offset amount for many others,\u201d the memo says.",

    "title": "Trump's China tariff threats are helping fuel a manufacturing boom \u2014 in Mexico",
    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 11:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The migration of manufacturing to Mexico could undermine Trump\u2019s promise to voters that ratcheting up tariffs on China would incentivize companies to bring production back to the U.S and give American companies a more even playing field.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that one of his top priorities when he takes office next week will be to impose steep tariffs on Chinese imports, a move he claims would protect American jobs and bolster domestic manufacturing.",
      "But if recent trends are any indication, one of the biggest beneficiaries might be workers in Mexico.",
      "After Trump levied tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Chinese goods in his first term, a growing number of companies moved manufacturing operations from China to Mexico. Industry analysts and executives working with Mexican manufacturers said that with Trump promising to escalate the trade war, they are seeing a renewed wave of interest from companies looking to shift production from China to Mexico.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and it\u2019s just getting started,\u201d said Raine Mahdi, whose company, Zipfox, connects businesses with manufacturers in Mexico. \u201cThe last time, this issue caught the tail end of the Trump administration, and then it pretty much died off with the Biden administration. Now it\u2019s already starting before Trump is even officially in office. It\u2019s not going to just go away. Companies are not going to be able to wait it out.\u201d",
      "There are generally no tariffs on goods made in Mexico that are shipped to the United States under the USMCA trade pact among the United States, Canada and Mexico \u2014 similar to the previous North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 though Trump has threatened Mexico with new tariffs if it doesn't do more to stop the flow of immigrants and drugs across its border.",
      "The migration of manufacturing to Mexico could undermine Trump\u2019s promise to voters that ratcheting up tariffs on China would give companies incentives to bring production back to the United States and give American companies a more even playing field. During Trump\u2019s first round of China tariffs, the number of companies moving production for the U.S. market out of China increased. But rather than relocate that production to the United States, many companies went to other low-cost countries, instead.",
      "\u201cIt will produce jobs in a few sectors who get protection and where there\u2019s not a way to make it offshore, but for most companies it just moves it from China to Vietnam or Mexico,\u201d said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economic. \u201cI really do think it\u2019s a false promise.\u201d",
      "Since his election, Trump has threatened to put tariffs on goods from Mexico on day one of his administration. But doing so would violate the USMCA trade pact \u2014 a deal Trump touted as a major negotiating victory during his first term. Breaching the agreement could trigger legal challenges and retaliatory tariffs that would affect U.S. companies, lawyers and trade policy analysts have said. It could also cause upheaval in the financial markets and increase prices for consumers on everything from cars to groceries, they said.",
      "The United States will be able to start renegotiating the USMCA pact in July 2026 under a provision in the agreement. If the three countries don\u2019t agree to extend the deal, it will terminate in 2036.",
      "But even with the looming uncertainty of tariffs, companies have continued their interest in Mexico, said Alejandro Delgado, Mexico country manager for SiiLA, a real estate data analytics firm.\u00a0Along with the low trade barriers, the close proximity to the United States means cheaper shipping costs and the ability to avoid potential bottlenecks at U.S. ports. Mexico also has relatively low labor costs, with a minimum wage of around $20 a day in the region near the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cSince Donald Trump\u2019s election, Chinese companies\u2019 interest in Mexico has remained, but with some uncertainty,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cOf course, there is this threat of implementing new tariffs, but the sense is that Mexico is in a better position to negotiate with the U.S. than China.\u201d",
      "In Nuevo Le\u00f3n, an area just south of the U.S. border, industrial parks full of Chinese companies have been springing up in recent years. Among those opening operations there are the equipment maker Lingong Machinery Group, which announced plans for a $5 billion industrial park, and the appliance maker Hisense, which said it would spend $260 million on a facility that it expects to create 7,000 jobs. Adjustable bed manufacturer Keeson Technology invested $30 million in a plant, and the Chinese furniture maker Kuka Home opened operations in Mexico in 2020 and announced a $150 million expansion in 2022 that it said would employ 3,500 people.",
      "In total, nearly $4 billion in investment deals were announced in 2023 by Chinese companies and an additional $1.4 billion were recorded in the first half of 2024, according to data compiled by the research firm Rhodium Group. While that is a relatively small amount compared with other countries with deeper ties to Mexico, it\u2019s nearly four times the average Chinese investment in Mexico from 2014 to 2020, the report found.",
      "The footprint of industrial real estate occupied by Chinese firms has doubled since 2021, with the largest investments coming from companies manufacturing higher-end products for the automotive and tech sectors, according to data from SiiLA. More than half of Chinese-based companies currently occupying industrial space in Mexico weren\u2019t present in the country before 2020, SiiLA said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese are creative, they\u2019re ambitious, they\u2019re aggressive, and you can try to tariff them and contain them as best as you can, but they\u2019ll always try to find the side route, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done with Mexico,\u201d Mahdi said. \u201cYou can try to plug all the holes, but they\u2019ll make a new one, because that\u2019s what they do. Their country is about manufacturing for the world. They\u2019re the best at it, and they want to continue to hold that position as the world\u2019s manufacturing hub.\u201d",
      "To qualify as \"made in Mexico,\u201d products must undergo a significant transformation in Mexico even if their components originate from other countries. Under the USMCA trade agreement, if a Chinese company imports parts for an appliance or a piece of furniture and assembles it in Mexico, that item is classified as an import from Mexico rather than from China.",
      "In addition to Chinese-owned companies\u2019 opening operations in Mexico, U.S.-based and other multinational corporations are looking to shift their manufacturing of products for the U.S. market from China to Mexico to avoid tariffs and to lower shipping costs and delivery times. As a result, China\u2019s share of U.S. imports has fallen from 22% in 2018 to 11.5% in the first half of last year,\u00a0according to data from J.P. Morgan.\u00a0Mexico exported more goods to the United States in 2023 than China for the first time in more than two decades.",
      "\u201cWe have seen significant foreign companies coming into Mexico, not only from China but countries like Germany and Japan, and not only in manufacturing industries but also construction companies, logistics companies, packaging companies,\u201d Delgado said.",
      "The shift in manufacturing from China to Mexico could also upend Trump\u2019s proposal to use the money the United States collects from tariffs to fund a variety of other policy priorities, since products made there are generally tariff-free. Under Trump\u2019s last wave of China tariffs, much of the revenue went to payments to help cover farmers\u2019 losses from retaliatory tariffs China placed on U.S. agricultural products.",
      "The trend hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by members of Trump\u2019s incoming administration. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s nominee for secretary of state, wrote a letter in September urging President Joe Biden to stop Chinese firms from \u201cexploiting Mexico\u2019s duty-free entry to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cAllowing Chinese firms \u2014 which routinely benefit from slave labor, stolen intellectual property, and massive state subsidies \u2014 to circumvent American trade enforcement and exploit our free trade agreements threatens American production,\u201d Rubio wrote. \u201cOur leaders must work diligently to replace Chinese production with American production, and that of our trading partners. Congress passed a free trade deal with Mexico\u2014not China. Immediate action must be taken to prevent the Chinese Communist Party from exploiting USMCA and weaponizing this important trade deal.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats and uncertainty around the future of the USMCA agreement have led to widespread uncertainty for some companies. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a Trump ally whom Trump has tasked with slashing federal spending, told investors in July that he was putting plans to build a factory in Mexico on hold over Trump\u2019s threat during the campaign to put tariffs on cars being shipped to the United States from Mexico.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tremendous uncertainty. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade for the Consumer Technology Association. \u201cThere are all these numbers being thrown out there by the president-elect. It\u2019s impossible for companies to plan with this kind of uncertainty. They\u2019re in a holding pattern. They\u2019re all waiting to see. They\u2019re doing a lot of scenario planning, contingency planning.\u201d",
      "But regardless of how Trump\u2019s tariff threats materialize, Brzytwa doesn\u2019t see a major shift in technology manufacturing coming back to the United States because of the high costs, a shortage of workers and difficulty in building new manufacturing facilities in the United States. Moving production of all technology products out of China and Taiwan and back to the United States would cost companies $500 billion and lead to workforce shortages, a report by CTA found.",
      "\u201cIf the goal is to move production back to the United States, that is completely infeasible,\u201d Brzytwa said. \u201cIn the United States, we don\u2019t have the existing capacity, and it\u2019s going to take a long time to build it, if we can at all. With our workforce, we\u2019re at full employment \u2014 it\u2019s almost impossible to find a workforce to build consumer technology products at scale.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "CLEVELAND \u2014 Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur slated to help oversee President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s effort to cut government spending, is in discussions about filling Vice President-elect JD Vance\u2019s Senate seat in Ohio, two people briefed on the process told NBC News.",
      "The development is a reversal for Ramaswamy, who in November said his work alongside billionaire Elon Musk at Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency would remove him from consideration for the Senate job.",
      "But Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who will appoint an interim successor to take over Vance's seat, chatted with Ramaswamy about the Senate vacancy during a meeting last weekend at the governor\u2019s mansion in Columbus, according to a source familiar with the talks. The source, who was granted anonymity to share details about private conversations, also said that Trump has encouraged Ramaswamy to accept the appointment if DeWine offers it.",
      "Trump aides did not respond to requests for comment. Spokespeople for DeWine and Ramaswamy declined to comment.",
      "\u201cNeither Governor DeWine nor our office has commented on any possible candidates for the pending appointment,\u201d DeWine spokesperson Dan Tierney wrote in a text message.",
      "The Washington Post first reported about Trump\u2019s encouragement of Ramaswamy. Politico first reported on the meeting with DeWine.",
      "Though Ramaswamy initially took himself out of the running for the Senate, he has been a constant factor in DeWine\u2019s deliberations over who should replace Vance, who resigned last week in advance of his swearing-in as vice president.",
      "Ramaswamy, a Cincinnati native who now lives in the Columbus area, is widely believed to be interested in running to succeed the term-limited DeWine as governor next year. But so is DeWine\u2019s preferred successor, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted.",
      "A bruising GOP primary featuring Husted, Ramaswamy and others could dent DeWine\u2019s legacy. Without any clear signal about Ramaswamy\u2019s intentions in 2026, DeWine has considered appointing Husted to the Senate vacancy to better solidify his close ally\u2019s political future. Whoever DeWine picks would have to win a special election in 2026 to serve the remaining two years of Vance\u2019s term.",
      "But Husted, who for two weeks has been viewed as the leading candidate for the appointment, has resisted past overtures to run for Senate and has been aggressively preparing his campaign for governor. Ohio Republicans wired into the process have said he has reservations about accepting the Senate appointment.",
      "DeWine has said he plans to reveal his choice \u201cprobably\u201d this week. Other possibilities include former state GOP chair Jane Timken and former state Rep. Jay Edwards.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why Ramaswamy would be willing to leave Trump\u2019s government efficiency team, known as DOGE, before its work even starts, nor is it clear if or why Trump would be eager for him to go. But some of Ramaswamy\u2019s recent posts on X, Musk\u2019s social media site, have created a rift within Trump\u2019s MAGA movement.",
      "Wading into a debate over H-1B temporary worker visas, a carve-out for high-skilled workers who some on the political right say are taking American jobs, Ramaswamy criticized an American culture that he said \u201cvenerated mediocrity over excellence.\u201d",
      "One source who speaks with Trump said the notion that Trump might be keen on Ramaswamy taking the Senate seat was not surprising.",
      "\u201cDJT is tired of him,\u201d the source said, referring to Trump by his initials. \u201cWants him in a new role.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has informed Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, that he will no longer be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, according to a GOP leadership source and a Republican lawmaker familiar with the matter.",
      "The lawmaker said Turner told him Wednesday that he would not be staying on as head of the critical panel that conducts oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. The House Intelligence Committee chair is also a member of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders who receive some of the most sensitive, classified briefings from the intelligence community.",
      "Johnson confirmed the news later Wednesday but downplayed the change as he offered praise for Turner.",
      "\"It's a new Congress. We just need fresh horses in some of these places. But I'm a Mike Turner fan,\" Johnson told reporters in the Capitol. \"He's done a great job. He performed valiantly in a difficult time under difficult circumstances. So I have nothing but positive things to say about my friend and colleague.\"",
      "\"This is not a President Trump decision; this is a House decision,\" the speaker added, referring to speculation that politics may have led to the change. \"And this is no slight whatsoever to our ... outgoing chairman.\"",
      "Johnson said he had decided that Turner would remain a member of the intelligence panel and that he would make an announcement about a replacement on Thursday.",
      "The top post on the Intelligence Committee is one of the few positions directly chosen by the speaker of the House at the start of a new Congress.",
      "A Turner spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "House Republican sources said they did not know who Johnson would choose to replace Turner. Some senior Republicans on the panel are Reps. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, Trent Kelly of Mississippi, and Darin LaHood of Illinois.",
      "Last year, Johnson raised eyebrows in the intelligence community and around Capitol Hill when he appointed two Donald Trump loyalists, Reps. Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, to the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The decision to replace Turner stunned lawmakers in both parties given that Turner, a defense hawk, is well-respected on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had tapped Turner to serve as the top Republican on the panel starting in January 2022. After Republicans took back the majority that fall, McCarthy kept him on as chairman of the Intelligence committee for the 118th\u00a0Congress, a term that started January 2023.",
      "When McCarthy was ousted and Johnson succeeded him as speaker in October 2023, Johnson decided to keep Turner in place as Intelligence chairman.",
      "Now, after winning his first full term as speaker earlier this month, Johnson appears to be putting his own mark on this position and others. On Tuesday, Johnson appointed Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the former Education and Workforce Committee chair, as the new Rules Committee chair.",
      "Democrats on the Intelligence Committee said they did not get any warning that Turner was being removed.",
      "\"I'm enormously concerned because I think you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody as fair-minded,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel.",
      "He added that Turner \"and I had our disagreements, but, you know, I had confidence in him.\"",
      "With Trump days away from returning to the White House, Democrats have been sounding the alarm that top intelligence and national security posts are being influenced by presidential politics.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Senate Democrats pressed former Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, Trump's pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, asking him if he would push back against efforts requiring CIA employees to demonstrate \"loyalty to a political figure above loyalty to country.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe, a former House Intelligence Committee member who served as Trump's director of national intelligence, responded that he would not impose a political litmus test on his employees.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about the last four years of his administration. He is stepping down from his career,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSo you can imagine the president has a lot to say, a lot of thoughts that he wants to share, really touch on the moment that we\u2019re in right now,\u201d she added.",
      "In a letter Wednesday previewing his prime-time remarks, Biden touted persistent job growth, lower prescription drug costs and investments in clean energy to fight climate change.",
      "He portrayed the early days of his administration as a battle to emerge from the grips of the Covid pandemic and \"a winter of peril,\" saying Americans came together and \"braved through it.\"",
      "\"We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure,\" Biden said in the letter.",
      "Biden also highlighted his economic record, particularly the consistent gains in the labor market.",
      "In a statement last week lauding the final monthly jobs report of his term, Biden said that more than 16.6 million new jobs were created since he took office and that his was \"the only administration in history to have created jobs every single month.\"",
      "Biden might be able to add a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas to his administration's list of accomplishments.",
      "If the agreement announced Wednesday afternoon goes into effect this weekend as planned, it would be a major breakthrough in the protracted war that has weighed on Biden\u2019s presidency and prompted criticism from within his own party.",
      "In his letter, Biden did not refer to President-elect Donald Trump by name but made indirect references to him.",
      "\"I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake. The very nature of who we are was at stake. And, that\u2019s still the case,\" he said.",
      "Jean-Pierre said Biden wants to \u201cbe positive\u201d and \u201ctalk about what we have been able to do.\u201d She also said the address was \u201cnot going to be partisan.\u201d",
      "Striking a personal tone in his letter, Biden reflected on his upbringing and his life as a public official. \"Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings\" serve for 50 years in the halls of Congress, as vice president and eventually in the Oval Office.",
      "\"I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people,\" he said.",
      "Biden has yet to lay out specifics for his post-presidency plans.",
      "He and the first lady plan to travel directly from the inauguration to Central California for personal time, three administration officials said. The couple plan to stay in Santa Barbara County, though wildfires in Los Angeles could affect their plans, officials said.",
      "Biden was asked by a reporter last week about his plans after leaving office: Would he speak out post-presidency or be \u201cout of sight and out of mind?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to be out of sight or out of mind,\u201d Biden responded."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris has a lot of options for her next act \u2014 including possible runs for governor of California in 2026 and president in 2028 \u2014 but writing a book may be first up, according to six people familiar with internal discussions about her future.",
      "Two of the people said that Harris, who will find herself out of elected office for the first time in more than two decades on Monday, has already decided to write a book. The others said the topic is under discussion.",
      "Thrust into the 2024 presidential campaign when President Joe Biden withdrew from the race in July, Harris quickly locked down the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination but lost the general election to former President Donald Trump. Since conceding to Trump, Harris has said little publicly about her 107-day sprint to try to save the presidency for her party. Not only could her written take recount the past, it could help shape her future.",
      "\u201cKamala Harris is poised to land the biggest book deal of any vice president in history,\u201d said Keith Urbahn, president and co-founder of the literary agency Javelin. \u201cBut the real question isn\u2019t the advance \u2014 it\u2019s whether the book can redefine her for 2028.\u201d",
      "Urbahn said Harris has an opportunity to \u201cget personal,\u201d acknowledge where she and the Democratic Party misread the sentiments of the electorate, and potentially reach out to a broader audience than her base.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a version of this book that is full of platitudes but safe, and then there\u2019s a version that reinvents her to lead a Democratic Party in need of rebuilding,\u201d he said. \u201cShe gets a payday either way, but only the latter gets her a second shot at the presidency.\u201d",
      "Many of Harris\u2019 advisers think she has a full-length story to tell, and that voters will want to read it.",
      "\u201cI think she owes it to people to write a book,\u201d one Harris confidant said.",
      "Ashley Etienne, who previously worked as Harris\u2019 vice presidential communications director, said that if Harris does write a book, she plans to buy copies of it for \u201call the women\u201d in her life, including her daughter.",
      "\u201cThe vice president is a historic figure with an incredible story to tell. From her leadership to tackle COVID, rebuild the economy and to protect the rights of women in this nation,\u201d Etienne said. \u201cPeople love her -- 70 plus million in fact. And I can imagine they\u2019re desperate for her to pull back the curtain on her groundbreaking journey from a child of immigrants to commanding the mantle of the most powerful country in the world.\u201d",
      "Harris\u2019 last book, \u201cThe Truths We Hold,\u201d released in conjunction with her first presidential campaign, landed at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in 2019. At the same time, she released a children\u2019s picture book, called \u201cSuperheroes are Everywhere.\u201d And in 2010, she wrote a memoir called \u201cSmart on Crime.\u201d"

    "summary": "Faiz Shakir, who managed Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, is jumping into the race for chair of the Democratic National Committee.",
    "story": [
      "Faiz Shakir, a longtime Democratic political operative who managed Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, is jumping into the race for chair of the Democratic National Committee just a few weeks before the vote.",
      "In an interview with NBC News, Shakir said the Democratic Party leadership needs to refocus on broader issues confronting the party as opposed to the details of how the DNC itself would be run.",
      "\u201cWe are debating how clean to keep the kitchen while the Titanic is going down,\u201d Shakir said of why he\u2019s throwing his name in the race. \u201cThe Democratic brand is the issue, and we\u2019re spending time worrying about, oh, the consultant contract and whether this state party has enough funding here or there.\u201d",
      "DNC members are set to vote for a new chair on Feb. 1, as the party takes its first steps toward rebuilding after losing the 2024 presidential election. Current DNC chair Jaime Harrison said after Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat to President-elect Donald Trump that he would not seek a second term running the party organization.",
      "In the aftermath, a handful of candidates have jumped in, led by a pair of Midwestern state party chairs: Minnesota's Ken Martin and Wisconsin's Ben Wikler. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley is also running alongside a handful of other candidates, but Martin and Wikler have attracted the most attention so far.",
      "Now, though, Shakir has joined the competition with 17 days to go, he confirmed to NBC News. The New York Times first reported Shakir\u2019s entry into the race.",
      "Shakir suggested while there is a place for social media posting and high-level forums among Democratic leadership, the party needs to focus on personal interactions.",
      "\u201cIn a society right now where people feel increasingly alone and isolated, you know, often on digital media, can we be one of those organizations that fills in the gaps to become a place of gathering in person, to build community with one another, to make us human again?\" he said.",
      "Those olive branches, Shakir suggested, should include sending pizza to striking union workers, and having a Super Bowl watch party with beer, as ways to ingratiate folks to the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cWhen you stick your head out and say, hey, I\u2019m going to do something that you didn\u2019t expect me to do, they will notice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just requires, you know, challenging the way you conventionally might think about what the DNC does.\u201d",
      "Shakir's decision to run for DNC chair comes after he poured cold water on the idea in November, when he joined NBC News' Chuck Todd on \u201cThe Chuck ToddCast.\u201d",
      "\"I do not think I could actually wage a campaign and win,\" Shakir said then. \"I don\u2019t think anybody wants me to be the DNC chair.\"",
      "Shakir walked those comments back speaking to NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI had some assumptions of people who I thought might run, who decided not to,\u201d Shakir said.",
      "Shakir has held a number of different roles across the Democratic Party over decades of work. Since managing Sanders' second presidential campaign, he has directed the nonprofit More Perfect Union, which describes itself as an advocacy journalism outlet. Previously, Shakir was the political director at the ACLU and an aide to former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and former House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi."

      "Six of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees faced Senate confirmation hearings Wednesday, previewing a parade of policy and political fights that will define his second term.",
      "The person who was in the hottest seat was former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. attorney general. She faced questions over whether she would stand up to a president who had pushed out the two men he previously appointed to be attorney general, as Ben Kamisar and Ryan J. Reilly report in their wrap-up of her day on Capitol Hill.",
      "Courtesy of Jonathan Allen, here are the key takeaways from Bondi\u2019s hearing, as well as the parade of hearings for other Cabinet nominees who appeared before senators.",
      "Bondi wouldn\u2019t say Trump lost in 2020: Bondi pointedly refused to say Trump lost the 2020 election fair and square under questioning from Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., at her hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden is the president of the United States. He was duly sworn in, and he is the president of the United States,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cThere was a peaceful transition of power. President Trump left office and was overwhelmingly elected in 2024.\u201d",
      "Durbin, the top-ranking Democrat on the panel, noted that Bondi did not give him a yes-or-no answer.",
      "Later, Bondi declined to retract her past statement that Trump had won Pennsylvania in 2020, and she pushed back against Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., for interrupting her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to be bullied by you,\u201d she told Padilla.",
      "Democrats grill Bondi over Trump\u2019s \u2014 and Kash Patel\u2019s \u2014 influence: Bondi told Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., that she would not use the attorney general\u2019s power to target political adversaries \u2014 even though Trump has often called for investigating and prosecuting his rivals.",
      "\u201cThere will never be an enemies list within the Department of Justice,\u201d Bondi said.",
      "Last month, Trump told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that decisions about whom to investigate and whom to prosecute would fall to Bondi and Kash Patel, his selection to head the FBI.",
      "Patel has said judges, lawyers and journalists should be prosecuted for perceived impropriety in pursuing investigations of Trump after the 2020 election. Bondi defended Patel \u2014 to an extent.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe he has an enemies list,\u201d Bondi said, adding that \u201cKash is the right person at this time for this job.\u201d",
      "But she told senators that they would have to ask Patel directly about his promotion of QAnon conspiracy theories.",
      "No one ruined their confirmation chances: In addition to Bondi, the following nominees also sat for hearings: Marco Rubio, for secretary of state; Sean Duffy, for transportation secretary; John Ratcliffe, for CIA director; Chris Wright, for energy secretary; and Russell Vought, for director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "The bottom line: None of them appeared to say anything that would cost them support from Republicans, portending a smooth road ahead.",

      "Biden and Trump both seek credit after a long road to a Gaza ceasefire deal",
      "After 15 torturous months of fruitless talks, there is finally a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza, with two American presidents taking credit \u2014 one on his way out, the other on his way in.",
      "Even before President Joe Biden announced the agreement, President-elect Donald Trump proclaimed it on Truth Social before he released a lengthy statement that said, in part, \u201cThis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November\u201d and \u201cWe have achieved so much without even being in the White House.\u201d",
      "An hour and a half later, Biden said from the White House: \u201cThis deal was developed and negotiated under my administration, but its terms will be implemented, for the most part, by the next administration. And these past few days we\u2019ve been speaking as one team.\u201d",
      "Asked how much credit he gave the Trump team, he replied, \u201cI told my team to coordinate closely with the incoming team to make sure we\u2019re all speaking with the same voice, because that\u2019s what American presidents do.\u201d",
      "But collaboration apparently goes only so far. As Biden was leaving, a reporter shouted: \u201cWho deserves credit for this, Mr. President? You or Trump?\u201d Biden stopped in his tracks, turned, and said, cracking a smile, \u201cIs that a joke?\u201d and left.",
      "In fact, Trump did pressure Hamas to compromise when he threatened on multiple occasions that \u201cthere will be hell to pay\u201d if Hamas didn\u2019t make a deal before he took office.",
      "That warning also pressured Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to finish the deal. Negotiators also credited Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for resolving last-minute snags in the last few days.",
      "It was a dramatic finish: According to a senior administration official, U.S., Israeli and Qatari negotiators in Doha, Qatar \u2014 and the Hamas team in the same building downstairs \u2014 thought they\u2019d finally sealed the deal at 3 a.m. Wednesday. But a few hours later, Hamas made new demands. After more haggling, it backed down, and it was done.",
      "Talks almost failed back on July 31, when Israel took out Ismail Haniyah, the Hamas negotiator, while he was in Tehran. Then, a month later, the negotiations came to a complete halt when American hostage Hersh Goldberg and five others were killed in a tunnel in Rafah on Aug. 31.",
      "What followed changed the balance of power in the region. Israel responded to Iran\u2019s missile attack, destroying its air defenses. Then, Israel killed Hezbollah\u2019s leaders in Lebanon, resulting in a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire there. Finally, Iran lost its other major ally, Syria, when Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime collapsed next door. With Iran severely weakened, Hamas was more willing to compromise.",
      "None of that would have happened without intensive, nonstop negotiations over 15 months by White House envoy Brett McGurk, 19 trips by CIA Director William Burns and 13 visits by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, each with stops in multiple countries. And McGurk now heads to Cairo to implement the deal and make sure the hostages start coming home. No matter who gets the credit.",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2025 23:54:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The scenes of destruction in Los Angeles have brought a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Steve Crowder.",
    "story": [
      "The scenes of destruction in Los Angeles have brought a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Steve Crowder. Six years ago, similar images of fires ravaging his community of Paradise, California, were plastered across televisions and social media.",
      "\u201cIt is Paradise revisited,\u201d said Crowder, the mayor of Paradise. \u201cSitting here watching the news, these fires in L.A. have hit me the hardest.\u201d",
      "Now, his town could give an indication of what the road to recovery may look like for those in the Los Angeles area joining the growing list of towns and cities devastated by wildfires. For those communities, recovery has been measured in years, not months. It has required billions of dollars in federal assistance, though federal money doesn't address every need after a disaster. And putting that money to use comes with unexpected challenges that have gone far deeper than the surface-level destruction.",
      "\u201cMy message to any of these towns is, don\u2019t let anybody tell you you can\u2019t come back, because we are proof you can come back. There is light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cThe first time you walk through your town you\u2019re going to think, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s no way we can come back from this.\u2019 Well, there is, even though it looks like you\u2019re walking through where a nuclear bomb went off.\u201d",
      "For those in Los Angeles, where the wildfires have killed at least 25 people and destroyed more than 12,300 structures, officials are beginning to discuss what may come next. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he is already starting to \u201creimagine L.A. 2.0,\u201d with a Marshall Plan-style rebuilding effort that could cost tens of billions of dollars.",
      "But much of that recovery will depend on federal resources, which could get entangled in wider political fights in Washington. Republicans in Washington have suggested putting conditions on aid to California or linking it to other policy priorities.",
      "President Joe Biden has made federal funding available for the next six months to cover temporary housing, emergency assistance to individuals and costs related to immediate public safety threats, like debris cleanup and hazardous materials.\u00a0But longer-term funding to rebuild public infrastructure, like water systems, roads and schools, will be up to the incoming administration and Congress.",
      "Meanwhile, coarsened political rhetoric and public blame-seeking on the part of Trump and others have added to an already uncertain situation for the fire survivors \u2014 and could be fueling politicization of the disaster, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, whose organization After the Fire has worked since 2017 with communities affected by wildfires.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I love about working in disasters is it\u2019s nonpartisan, everyone gathers together as Americans and they support each other. But now I\u2019m getting messages every day telling me, \u2018You deserve it, we\u2019re so glad this happened to you,\u2019\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThere have been parts of America that have always been unkind, but I\u2019ve never known us to have this level of cruelty.\u201d",
      "A long road to recovery",
      "Even without the current level of political infighting, the rebuilding process for communities affected by past wildfires has been yearslong and could indicate a long road ahead for those in Los Angeles.",
      "It can take weeks before residents are even able to check on their properties and more than a year before all the debris and hazardous materials are removed so homeowners can start rebuilding. It could be several more years before critical infrastructure, like water systems, power lines, roads and schools, is fully rebuilt, with funding fights in Washington potentially delaying that progress further.",
      "\u201cI hate to say it, but if you lost your house, and even if you have the means to rebuild, you better buckle up, because it\u2019s going be a ride that you\u2019re not going to like,\u201d said Pete Gaynor, who served as administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency during the Trump administration. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it that way. It\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d",
      "For those who lost their homes, FEMA provides temporary shelter, typically in hotels. But setting up longer-term temporary housing, like mobile home communities, can take more than a year, in order to find the land for those structures and to build out the road, water and electric infrastructure, Gaynor said.",
      "In Paradise, 90% of the town, including 18,000 structures, was destroyed and 85 people were killed. The population went from around 26,000 people, many of them retirees, to as few as 2,000 overnight. Along with losing their homes and businesses, residents lost their jobs, children lost their schools and the city lost nearly all of its tax revenue.",
      "Six years later, rebuilding is now well underway. The city is constructing around 500 homes a year and has rebuilt a third of its homes with its population up to 11,000, according to Crowder. Last year, Paradise was the fastest-growing city in California, attracting a mix of returning residents and newcomers, many of whom are families drawn to the town because of its schools and relative affordability, Crowder said.",
      "Nearly all of the city\u2019s infrastructure was damaged in the fire, including water systems, cell towers, power lines, roads and schools. Officials are still in the process of installing underground power lines and repaving roads. One silver lining of the process has been the ability for the city to rebuild with more modern infrastructure and buildings that will be more resilient to future fires.",
      "FEMA has helped fund much of that rebuilding, but the federal process has felt belabored and full of red tape, at times, Crowder said.",
      "\u201cThey operate like a typical big government machine. Although the help was appreciated, it is a little slow sometimes,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cIt\u2019s all good intentions, but some of the assistance that is offered is almost impossible to get. It sounds good on paper, but we are still seeing some of that with the housing situation where people are applying for programs but they are so stringent that no one could qualify.\u201d",
      "Crowder, who was a city council member as the city started to rebuild, has been on the phone with local officials in Los Angeles County, helping guide them through the early stages of their recovery.",
      "The most recent California fires have also affected him personally: His daughter lost her home in Altadena last week to the Eaton Fire, which has killed at least 11 residents and destroyed more than 1,900 structures.",
      "Federal funding is only part of the equation in fire recovery",
      "Crowder lost his home and business in the 2018 fire, and it took him 18 months to be able to rebuild at a cost that far exceeded what his insurance company paid him for his loss. While most fire victims in Paradise had some form of insurance, many didn\u2019t receive enough to cover the full cost of rebuilding, because costs skyrocketed following the surge in demand for labor and materials after the disaster.",
      "\u201cThe majority of people that had insurance in Paradise were underinsured and didn\u2019t realize it,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cIf one or two houses had burned, we probably wouldn\u2019t have been underinsured, because before the fire you could build a house for $150 a square foot. That went overnight to $350 a square foot, and the insurance didn\u2019t go that far.\u201d",
      "The town also had to contend with alleged fraud by contractors, who fire victims said took millions of dollars in insurance payments from them without providing the promised work, Crowder said.",
      "For those who have been able to rebuild, finding and affording homeowners insurance has become another struggle. Crowder said the typical policy has gone from around $1,500 a year to $5,000 through the state-backed insurer of last resort. It's an issue that will likely only get worse for Californians following the Los Angeles fires.",
      "In Maui, Hawaii, more than 2,000 structures were destroyed in the community of Lahaina and around 12,000 were displaced in a fire that killed at least 100 people in August 2023.",
      "FEMA and other federal agencies have provided about $3 billion toward Maui\u2019s wildfire recovery, with more than $1.3 billion going to direct rebuilding efforts, like removing debris, providing temporary housing, rebuilding a local school and repairing public infrastructure.",
      "Much of the first year of the recovery in Maui was spent clearing debris and hazardous material before property owners could begin rebuilding. It also took around a year for the Environmental Protection Agency to complete the process of testing, inspecting and clearing damaged water and sewer infrastructure so local officials could begin repairing and rebuilding those systems.",
      "In addition to debris removal, the properties also had to pass soil inspections, since fires can cause toxic materials to leak into the ground, and have erosion control measures put in place following the loss of the vegetation that typically holds the soil in place.",
      "Housing has been an especially difficult challenge in Lahaina, where there was already an affordable housing shortage \u2014 something Los Angeles was struggling with as well before the fires. Many residents were forced to move to other parts of the island or leave altogether, and housing has been a particular challenge for renters, said Jason Economou, president of the Maui United Way.",
      "Nearly 15 months after the fire, families began moving into a temporary FEMA housing complex that consists of 169 modular homes.\u00a0FEMA is also providing mobile homes that people can place on their private properties while they wait to rebuild.",
      "But not all residents displaced from their homes were eligible for FEMA housing assistance. That includes people whose homes were badly damaged but didn\u2019t burn, as well as undocumented immigrants, said Kimo Carvalho, executive director for HomeAid Hawaii, a nonprofit affordable housing developer.",
      "His organization is in the process of moving residents into a state-funded development for those ineligible for FEMA assistance. It received more than 900 applications for 450 manufactured housing units where residents can live for up to five years. The first residents started moving in a year after the fire and the development is expected to be fully occupied by April.",
      "\u201cTheir lives have been on pause for a year. Most have been in three to four different living arrangements, a lot of them weren\u2019t able to maintain their full-time jobs, so they\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to make money,\u201d Carvalho said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started seeing everyone move in that they started stabilizing. Then it\u2019s almost like all the things that they were dealing with pre-fire are finally starting to come out.\u201d",
      "Beyond the price and logistics of rebuilding, there has also been the emotional cost.",
      "Families have had to frequently move between temporary housing arrangements across the island, and a once tight-knit community has unraveled. That\u2019s left residents feeling isolated and without a support network, compounding the struggles they face with rebuilding their lives after the fire, Economou said.",
      "\u201cThe community is never going to be quite the same,\u201d Economou said. \u201cWhen people are forced to move as economic refugees, the makeup of the community changes, the size and the amount of housing that\u2019s available changes. It\u2019s not just that the old stuff is gone, so we\u2019re just going to rebuild and pick up where we left off. That\u2019s impossible. The community will never be the same after an event like this.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "As the wildfires in Southern California continue to burn, streaks of bright pink fire retardant have become a familiar sight.",
      "Fanned by strong Santa Ana winds, the fires have killed at least 25 people and burned around 40,000 acres in the greater Los Angeles area. More than a week after it ignited, the area's largest blaze, the Palisades Fire, was 19% contained as of Wednesday. Los Angeles County has declared a public health emergency because of the smoke.",
      "The powdered substance being sprayed over the wildfires is called Phos-Chek. It can be dropped from the air or applied via trucks on the ground. It's primarily made up of water, ammonium phosphate \u2014 an ingredient commonly found in fertilizer \u2014 and pink coloring, though it's thickened with gum to improve accuracy for aerial drops.",
      "\u201cPhos-Chek is a fertilizer-based retardant product. It\u2019s the same ingredients that are used on your fertilizer for lawn care,\u201d said Shannon Horn, chief operating officer at Perimeter Solutions, the maker of Phos-Chek.",
      "When used in fire retardant, ammonium phosphate can change the way the cellulose in plants reacts to heat. Ordinarily, plants exposed to a fire's heat begin to decompose and become fuel, but Phos-Chek acts as a coating, creating a barrier that consumes the heat energy. The reaction produces a nonflammable carbon material, thereby slowing a blaze to buy firefighters time."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has informed Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, that he will no longer be chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, according to a GOP leadership source and a Republican lawmaker familiar with the matter.",
      "The lawmaker said Turner told him Wednesday that he would not be staying on as head of the critical panel that conducts oversight of the U.S. intelligence community. The House Intelligence Committee chair is also a member of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" congressional leaders who receive some of the most sensitive, classified briefings from the intelligence community.",
      "Johnson confirmed the news later Wednesday but downplayed the change as he offered praise for Turner.",
      "\"It's a new Congress. We just need fresh horses in some of these places. But I'm a Mike Turner fan,\" Johnson told reporters in the Capitol. \"He's done a great job. He performed valiantly in a difficult time under difficult circumstances. So I have nothing but positive things to say about my friend and colleague.\"",
      "\"This is not a President Trump decision; this is a House decision,\" the speaker added, referring to speculation that politics may have led to the change. \"And this is no slight whatsoever to our ... outgoing chairman.\"",
      "Johnson said he had decided that Turner would remain a member of the intelligence panel and that he would make an announcement about a replacement on Thursday.",
      "The top post on the Intelligence Committee is one of the few positions directly chosen by the speaker of the House at the start of a new Congress.",
      "A Turner spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "House Republican sources said they did not know who Johnson would choose to replace Turner. Some senior Republicans on the panel are Reps. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, Trent Kelly of Mississippi, and Darin LaHood of Illinois.",
      "Last year, Johnson raised eyebrows in the intelligence community and around Capitol Hill when he appointed two Donald Trump loyalists, Reps. Scott Perry, R-Pa., and Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, to the Intelligence Committee.",
      "The decision to replace Turner stunned lawmakers in both parties given that Turner, a defense hawk, is well-respected on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had tapped Turner to serve as the top Republican on the panel starting in January 2022. After Republicans took back the majority that fall, McCarthy kept him on as chairman of the Intelligence committee for the 118th\u00a0Congress, a term that started January 2023.",
      "When McCarthy was ousted and Johnson succeeded him as speaker in October 2023, Johnson decided to keep Turner in place as Intelligence chairman.",
      "Now, after winning his first full term as speaker earlier this month, Johnson appears to be putting his own mark on this position and others. On Tuesday, Johnson appointed Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., the former Education and Workforce Committee chair, as the new Rules Committee chair.",
      "Democrats on the Intelligence Committee said they did not get any warning that Turner was being removed.",
      "\"I'm enormously concerned because I think you'd be hard-pressed to find somebody as fair-minded,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence panel.",
      "He added that Turner \"and I had our disagreements, but, you know, I had confidence in him.\"",
      "With Trump days away from returning to the White House, Democrats have been sounding the alarm that top intelligence and national security posts are being influenced by presidential politics.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Senate Democrats pressed former Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, Trump's pick to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, asking him if he would push back against efforts requiring CIA employees to demonstrate \"loyalty to a political figure above loyalty to country.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe, a former House Intelligence Committee member who served as Trump's director of national intelligence, responded that he would not impose a political litmus test on his employees.",
      "\u201cIf you look at my record and my record as DNI, that never took place. That is never something anyone alleged,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I would never do.\u201d"

      "Basgiath War College: The school that every Navarrian officer goes through. Each student chooses to enter one of four quadrants: Healers, Scribes, Infantry or Riders, the quadrant with the highest death rate. Near Basgiath are the dragon hatching grounds known as the Vale. Basgiath is where the original dragon riders, known as the First Six, wove the wards of Navarre, which protect the borders.",
      "Tyrrendor: One of the provinces that make up Navarre. Tyrrendor's leaders tried and failed to secede from Navarre in the Tyrrish Rebellion before the events of the books. Navarre's wards that originate near Basgiath do not reach Tyrrendor. Aretia was the capital before the Tyrrish Rebellion.",

Once bonded, they have a channel of communication within their Riders mind, and the dragon's power manifests in a Rider in the form of a signet.",

She's a lightning wielder.",
      "Xaden Riorson: The main love interest of Violet and son of Tyrrish Rebellion leader, Fen Riorson. Xaden begins as an enemy since Violet's mother executed Xaden's father. Xaden is the oldest marked one, fulfilling a de facto leadership role for the rest of the group. He also took responsibility for the 107 marked ones safety. Xaden and Violet have had a tumultuous relationship so far, with plenty of secrets. Xaden is leading another revolution and has two signets: shadow-summoning and is an inntinnsic (meaning he can read minds). He is bonded to Sgaeyl, who is mated to Tairn, giving Xaden and Violet a path to mind speak to one another.",

      "Andarna: She is an unknown breed of dragon and the second bonded dragon to Violet. When she was a baby dragon (known as a feathertail) she was able to stop time for brief moments. However, the power faded with age. Currently, she can change the color of her scales, but her development from a child into an adolescent was altered. By the end of \"Iron Flame,\" her personality is akin to that of a teenager: moody, keen on not being left out and searching for independence.",
      "Sgaeyl: She's a blue daggertail dragon, mated to Tairn and bonded to Xaden.",
      "Dain Aetos: Violet's childhood best friend, although they've grown slightly apart as adults. The pair had a brief romantic moment; however, it did not last.

      "Violet struggles to survive each day at Basgiath War College, facing threats from fellow cadet Jack Barlowe, who views her as weak. But she uses her book smarts to make it through physical fights and training.",
      "One night, she overhears Xaden holding a secret meeting with all the rebellion children. Basgiath has a rule that no more than three marked ones can meet at once, so this meeting is a capital offense. Violet is caught by Xaden, but she promises to keep the meeting a secret.",
      "She ends up excelling at Threshing, bonding with not only one, but two dragons: Andarna, who is thought to be a golden feathertail, and Tairn, an extremely powerful black dragon.",
      "Violet and Dain kiss after Threshing, although Violet doesn't think it feels right. Afterwards, the pair maintain a friendship.",
      "Bonding with Tairn immediately links her to Xaden, as Tairn is mated to Xaden's dragon, Sgaeyl, giving them the power to mind speak to each other.",
      "Despite being mortal enemies, Xaden ends up training Violet. A rider will die if their dragon dies, and occasionally, a dragon can't recover after their rider's death. Tairn and Sgaeyl's mating bond also means they cannot be apart from each other for long, and if one dies, so does the other. Because of their mated dragons, Xaden now needs to keep Violet alive to keep himself alive.",
      "Xaden assigns Liam to be Violet's shadow and security guard. Although Violet initially hates this, she and Liam grow a close friendship.",
      "Xaden also trains her, and in the process, they get to know each other better, sparking attraction.",

      "What happens at the end of 'Fourth Wing'?",
      "In the books climactic ending, Dain betrays Violet.",
      "Throughout the book, Dain regularly touches her face in times of worry. It's revealed that secretly, he'd been using his signet to read her thoughts, and he saw the secret, illegal meeting Xaden held. Dain reported it.",
      "When the War Games, an end of year test of a squad's abilities, comes around, Dain's dad, Colonel Aetos, assigns Xaden and Violet's squad to go to Aethebyne,\u00a0located beyond the wards' safety.",
      "When they get there, Violet learns that Xaden has been secretly assisting gryphon riders from Poromiel, supplying them with weapons. It turns out, the reason they've been attacking Navarrian outposts is because they are under attack from venin, creatures Violet previously believed were only myth, and needed supplies.",
      "Learning that venin exist and that the gryphon fliers aren't the true enemy, Violet is forced to question her complacency and her mother's role in spreading propaganda.",
      "The squad then realizes that Colonel Aetos sent them into a trap. Instead of a War Games exercise, they are forced into real battle against four venin while trying to defend a nearby village.",
      "Working in tandem with the gryphon riders, they fight the venin and win the battle, but at deadly costs. Liam's dragon is killed, which kills Liam as well. Violet holds him as he dies and promises she will protect his younger sister, Sloane.",
      "During the battle, Violet takes out the final venin with a bolt of lightning, but before it dies, it stabs her with a poisoned blade. Xaden flies a semi-unconscious Violet to his secret hideout in Aretia.",
      "Violet is mended and eventually wakes up furious at Xaden for his deception. Still, Violet agrees to join the revolution and keep it a secret, but she tells Xaden she can't trust him with her heart.",
      "The novel ends with one more secret Xaden was hiding: Violet's dead brother, Brennan, is very much alive, and he was the one who mended Violet.",
      "\"Welcome to the revolution, Violet,\" is the last line of the book, spoken by Brennan, as he smiles at his shocked sister.",
      "What happens in 'Iron Flame'?",
      "\"Iron Flame\" begins where the first book ended, but Violet's inner turmoil is at an all-time high as she comes to terms with fables being real, mourns the loss of Liam, battles conflicting emotions regarding Brennan being alive and misses Xaden, despite not wanting to.",
      "After they return to Basgiath, Xaden graduates and is immediately stationed at Samara. However, because Tairn and Sgaeyl are mated and need to see each other consistently, Violet and Xaden are given leave once a week to see each other.",
      "Xaden promises to help Violet build her mental shields so she can protect her mind from Dain and others with similar signets. As for their relationship, they still struggle with trust. With Xaden becoming the revolution's leader, he needs to keep some secrets, but Violet requests full disclosure if he wants to be together. They remain at an impasse for a while.",
      "Meanwhile, the other marked ones continue to smuggle weapons out of Basgiath to gryphon fliers. Violet, now a second-year, embarks on a research journey in the Archives, with the help of Jesinia, to figure out how Basgiath wards work so she can set up wards around Aretia.",
      "New characters are introduced, including first years Aaric and Sloane, who Violet promised to protect, as well as new villains, like Major Varrish, who is known for his harsh torture techniques and harbors a hatred for Violet.",
      "As Violet continues to search for accounts from the First Six on how the wards were created, Jack Barlowe returns to Basgiath. It turns out, Violet didn't kill him in the first book, and he's been going through an extensive mending process.",
      "With the help of her friends, Violet figures out that the journals of the First Six are most likely in King Tauri's private vault, but they'll need someone from his bloodline to get in, so they rope Aaric into their plan.",
      "But before they can enact it, infantry cadets try to kill Violet. Surprisingly, Jack saves her, though it doesn't change her distrust of him.",
      "Violet and Xaden eventually break into the Archives for the journals and take two. However, Nolan, a healer who Violet has always trusted, deceives and drugs her. Varrish arrives, taking one of the journals with him.",
      "Violet is subjected to torture from Varrish, but she holds strong. In a final act to break her, Varrish calls in Dain and commands him read Violet's memories, which he does. After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",
      "Xaden uses the chaos of Basgiath to his advantage, addressing all the cadets and telling them the truth of what's happening beyond the wards. He gives them the option to stay at Basgiath and defend Navarre, or, come with him to fight for the whole Continent. Nearly half the quadrant decides to join.",
      "The group continues holding classes for the riders at Aretia as Violet tries to translate the journals and get the wards up and running. Soon, she thinks she's discovered the solution: blood magic.",
      "After her first attempt fails, Violet goes in search of a luminary. She visits Poromiel's leader, Viscount Tecarus, and learns that Xaden was offered a luminary in exchange for herself, a deal he refused.  After having to fight off another venin and agreeing to train gryphon fliers in Aretia, Xaden and Violet secure the luminary.",
      "Back at Aretia, Violet, Xaden and his ex-fianc\u00e9e, a gryphon flier named Cat, spar over their twisted romantic pasts. Xaden reveals he is technically heir to Tyrrendor, reassuring Violet that he and Cat were only ever together for a political alliances.",
      "But just as the pair starts to piece their relationship back together, it crumbles once more when Violet realizes that Xaden has a secret second signet, since Sgaeyl bonded Xaden and his grandfather before him.",
      "Violet demands he tell her what it is. He reveals he's inntinnsic, meaning he can read minds. Manifesting as an inntinnsic typically results in death in Navarre.",
      "How does 'Iron Flame' end?",
      "General Melgren, General Lilith Sorrengail and some other members of leadership request a meeting with Violet, Xaden and Mira.",
      "Melgren tells them that he's seen an upcoming battle, claiming the venin will attack Samara and win. He asks them to help in the battle, but Brennan reveals himself, telling them no.",
      "Violet then realizes that the real battle won't be at Samara, but at Basgiath. Violet convinces Xaden that they have to fight for Basgiath, but Brennan refuses.",
      "Violet and Xaden give the cadets and gryphon fliers the choice to fight or not, and most decide to join.",
      "When they arrive, Violet and Xaden rush to the wardstone, passing dead guards, to find Jack and his dragon within the chamber. It turns out, Jack survived Violet dropping a mountain on him because he turned venin. Jack kills his own dragon, which cracks the wardstone in half, knocking down the college's wards.",
      "Xaden knocks Jack out before he can draw power from the ground.",
      "They begin to assemble their forces, as Brennan arrives with more riders and fliers. Brennan tries to mend the wardstone as the battle above begins.",
      "One of the venin reveals that their goal is to take Violet alive. Violet kills the venin and runs to Jesinia, who has been continuously transcribing one of the First Six's journals amidst the battle. Jesinia reveals that Andarna is the secret to activating the wardstone. Andarna turns out to be a dragon breed of her own and waited for Violet \u2014\u00a0a period of 650 years \u2014\u00a0before hatching.",
      "Now, Violet has a solution to their ongoing battle. But a dragon can only power one wardstone, meaning Violet and Xaden have to decide to protect either Basgiath or Aretia.",
      "Xaden tells her to go ahead and ward Basgiath. But first, the wardstone has to be imbued with a rider's power, which typically takes weeks to do safely.",
      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",
      "The final pages of \"Iron Flame\" are from Xaden's perspective. Xaden seeks out Jack for help finding a cure to being venin. Jack responds that there is no cure, saying Xaden will \"only hunger for more\" power.",
      "\"All this time, you've been convincing everyone you're the hero, and now you'll be the villain... especially in her story,\" Jack says. \"Welcome to our f---ed-up family. Guess we're brothers now.\""

    "summary": "Why the Village People are performing at Donald Trump's inauguration despite their \"preferred candidate\" losing.",
    "story": [
      "Victor Willis, the lead singer of the Village People, is explaining why the long-running disco band has decide to take part in Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration.",
      "Willis shared a statement on Jan. 13 announcing the the band's members had agreed to join other artists, including Carrie Underwood, Jason Aldean, Billy Ray Cyrus and Kid Rock, to perform at multiple inaugural activities, including at least one event with the president-elect himself.",
      "\u201cWe know this wont (sic) make some of you happy to hear however we believe that music is to be performed without regard to politics,\u201d Willis wrote on Facebook. \u201cOur song Y.M.C.A. is a global anthem that hopefully helps bring the country together after a tumultuous and divided campaign where our preferred candidate lost.\u201d",
      "Willis added, \"Therefore, we believe it\u2019s now time to bring the country together with music which is why VILLAGE PEOPLE will be performing at various events as part of the 2025 Inauguration of Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "Trump has played the band's 1978 disco anthem \"Y.M.C.A.\" during campaign rallies, even dancing along with attendees on the ground who spell out the song title's letters with their arms.",
      "Willis co-wrote \"Y.M.C.A.\" with late French music producer Jacques Morali, who was instrumental in creating the Village People. Morali, who was gay, died of complications from AIDS in 1991.",
      "\"Y.M.C.A.\" and other Village People hits, including \"Macho Man\" and \"In The Navy,\" were early on embraced as an anthem by the LGTBQ+ community, a point that came up in some of the shocked comments left alongside Willis' announcement.",
      "\"You would think that as a band founded and focused around queer culture, you\u2019d have a little more respect for queer people. Not to mention a backbone, for yourself,\" wrote one angry fan.",
      "Meanwhile, other fans applauded the band for agreeing to perform with unity in mind.",
      "\"Congratulations! A well deserved honor. The music has been claimed by many. So let\u2019s enjoy it together,\" someone wrote.",
      "Last month, Willis defended Trump\u2019s use of \"Y.M.C.A.\" at campaign rallies, saying in a Dec. 2 Facebook statement that the song was never intended to be a \u201cgay anthem.\u201d",
      "\"There\u2019s been a lot of talk, especially of late, that Y.M.C.A. is somehow a gay anthem. As I\u2019ve said numerous times in the past, that is a false assumption based on the fact that my writing partner was gay, and some (not all) of Village People were gay, and that the first Village People album was totally about gay life,\" wrote Willis.",
      "Willis explained that the lyrics he contributed to \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d were informed by his observations at YMCA branches in \"urban areas of San Francisco,\" where young men participated in \"swimming, basketball, track, and cheap food and cheap rooms.\"",
      "\"And when I say, 'hang out with all the boys' that is simply 1970s black slang for black guys hanging-out together for sports, gambling or whatever.  There\u2019s nothing gay about that,\" he wrote, noting that had instructed his wife to \u201cstart suing\u201d news organizations who refer to the song as a \u201cgay anthem.\"",

      "For some parents, talking about their child's drug addiction on national TV might seem like a regrettable decision, but Mary Cosby, star of \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City,\" believes it's \"the best thing\" her family has done.",
      "\"It's a fine line between putting your kids out there and then protecting them,\" she tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview. \"It was just something that I questioned all the way up until it aired.\"",
      "In the stunningly emotional scene in a November episode of the reality TV show, Cosby sat down with her only child, Robert Jr., 22, to address why he was pulling away from her.",
      "The ensuing conversation showed the mother telling her son, \"You've got to be real, you've got to talk to me.\" He responded that he took Xanax the night before to help him fall asleep and Adderall to \"balance out the Xanax.\" He went on to disclose that he had been using drugs recreationally since he turned 16, including cocaine, acid and molly.",
      "\"I won't judge you,\" a devastated Cosby answered. \"I can try to help you, but you have to help yourself, because I'm not going to support it. I'm not. You know I'm not.\"",

      "One social media user wrote, \u201cShe was so gentle in the way she talked with him \ud83d\ude2d.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was waiting to be asked\u2026I was blown away by his genuine honesty. I really hope this helps other kids feel safe to open up, be honest & get the help,\u201d commented another.",
      "Andy Cohen even called it \u201cone of the most raw, real and heart-wrenching\u201d moments in the Bravo franchise\u2019s history during a November episode of \"Watch What Happens Live.\" (Bravo is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "Cosby tells TODAY.com that she's a \"helicopter mom\" who wants to \"protect my son at all costs,\" so it was a challenging decision to be so public about the conversation. But the response has both motivated Robert Jr. to continue his recovery and made her feel confident the scene had a powerful impact.",
      "Before the scene aired, Cosby says she was contacted by tabloids threatening to publish that Robert Jr. was in rehab. \"I was like, well, I'm just going to let this air, and then they can all just be quiet,\" she says. \"It really worked.\"",
      "Cosby says there wasn't much preparation that went into the conversation. She simply told her son, \"I'm going to sit down, and it probably will be in front of the cameras, so I'm going to need you to be honest.\"",
      "Like viewers, she learned of the extent of his drug use in that moment. \"I just didn't see all that coming,\" she recalls. \"I didn't know he was going to say all that. I was in the moment ... and it shocked me, and it hurt me. It just made me feel like, 'Oh my god. How did I miss the cues?'\"",
      "\"It wasn't planned,\" she continues. \"What came out of him was real, and what came out of me was real. And I think that's why it went across so good, because we weren't doing it for any sole reason. We were doing it because that's our relationship.\""

    "summary": "YouTubers Myka Stauffer and her husband James Stauffer gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son in 2020. A new documentary explores the controversy.",
    "story": [
      "YouTubers Myka Stauffer\u00a0and James Stauffer ignited a firestorm of controversy when they gave up custody of their adopted 4-year-old son with special needs in 2020. Now a new HBO documentary series, \"An Update on our Family,\" revisits the Stauffers' story.",
      "The limited three-part series, which will premiere on HBO on Wednesday, Jan. 15, uses the Stauffer controversy to explore wider issues about what happens when parents decide to make their private family lives public.",
      "But why are the Stauffers' decisions so controversial? Take a look at how the family rose to social media stardom ... and then enraged their followers.",
      "Who is Myka Stauffer and her husband James?",
      "Myka Stauffer had a parenting and lifestyle YouTube channel with more than 700,000 subscribers.\u00a0Together with her husband, she and her four biological children \u2014 Nakova, Jaka, Radley and Onyx \u2014 had a family YouTube channel, The Stauffer Life, with more than 300,000 followers.",
      "Neither channel is publicly accessible on YouTube at the time of this story's publication.",
      "The Ohio-based vlogger parents\u00a0began inviting viewers into their international adoption journey in 2016, via social media. Myka Stauffer produced 27 videos with the boy they named Huxley, sharing everything from fundraising to grappling with the ever-changing rules surrounding international adoption to learning about their potential child\u2019s special needs.",
      "Why did Myka and James Stauffer adopt a child?",
      "In an article for Parade\u00a0in September 2019, Myka wrote, \"My husband was resistant (to adoption) at first, but after letting him reflect on the idea for several months, we both agreed to start researching and see what surfaced.\"",
      "The couple felt compelled to pursue an international adoption, \"and we kept being lead to China,\" Myka Stauffer wrote. Because Chinese adoption laws would only allow U.S. couples to adopt children with special needs, the couple had to decide if they were prepared to take on additional challenges.",
      "And then, Myka Stauffer wrote, she \u201csaw a little face that I couldn\u2019t walk away from.\u201d This little boy had a brain tumor; Myka Stauffer said that since she was an oncology nurse, \u201ctumors didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d",
      "She wrote, \u201cUltimately, his sad little face won our hearts over and we just knew that he was our little guy.\u201d",
      "Who is Huxley, the boy the Stauffers adopted?",
      "The boy was 2.5 years old when the whole Stauffer family flew to China to meet him and bring him to their home in America. They renamed him Huxley.",
      "Over the years, the Stauffers updated their followers on their experience adopting a child with special needs, sometimes on posts that featured advertising from major companies.",
      "Not all videos about Huxley were monetized, but many of the videos about adoption were some of the most watched on the channel, raising the Stauffers\u2019 profile and clout online. In the last two years, the video on their channel with the most views, 5.5 million, was\u00a0\u201cHuxley\u2019s EMOTIONAL Adoption VIDEO!! GOTCHA DAY China Adoption.\u201d",
      "Why did the the Stauffers find a new home for their adopted son?",
      "At the age of 4, Huxley was just starting to form words verbally and had learned a few words in sign language.",
      "Myka Stauffer said, in her Parade essay and in now-deleted videos, the family learned eventually that Huxley did not, in fact, have a brain tumor. Instead, they shared, he had a number of different medical issues: he suffered a stroke in utero, and had autism and sensory processing disorder.",
      "Eagle-eyed followers began to notice that Huxley was missing from photos and other posts on the family\u2019s social media and YouTube channel. In May 2020, the Stauffers posted a video that was viewed by TODAY.com and has since been deleted, explaining what was happening with their adopted son.",
      "\u201cOnce Huxley came home, there was a lot more special needs that we weren\u2019t aware of, and that we were not told,\u201d James Stauffer said in the video, titled \u201can update on our family.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor us, it\u2019s been really hard hearing from the medical professionals, a lot of their feedback, and things that have been upsetting,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve never wanted to be in this position. And we\u2019ve been trying to get his needs met and help him out as much as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not an ounce of our body that doesn\u2019t love Huxley with all of our being,\u201d Myka Stauffer added. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a minute that I didn\u2019t try our hardest and I think what Jim is trying to say is that after multiple assessments, after multiple evaluations, numerous medical professionals have felt that he needed a different fit and that (with) his medical needs, he needed more.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I feel like a failure as a mom? Like, 500%,\u201d Myka Stauffer said, adding that Huxley was living with a \u201cnew mommy\u201d in a \u201cforever home.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe last couple months have been like the hardest thing I could have ever imagined to going to choosing to do ... after pouring our guts and our heart into this little boy,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is thriving, he is happy, he is doing really well, and his new mommy has medical professional training, and it is a very good fit.\u201d",
      "Why are people upset by the Stauffers' decision?",
      "An online uproar followed the Stauffers' announcement.",
      "Almost 50,000 people (as of publication of this article) have signed a\u00a0Change.org petition\u00a0demanding that the Stauffers remove all monetized content featuring Huxley from YouTube. And in a now-completed case, local authorities investigated the \u201cwell-being\u201d of Huxley Stauffer in response to compaints. No charges were filed.",
      "TODAY.com reached out to the Stauffers' attorney and did not get a response. In 2020, in a statement to People magazine, Myka and James Stauffer\u2019s lawyers, Thomas Taneff and Taylor Sayers, said:",
      "\u201cWe are privy to this case and given the facts at hand, we feel this was the best decision for Huxley ... In coming to know our clients we know they are a loving family and are very caring parents that would do anything for their children.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince his adoption, they consulted with multiple professionals in the healthcare and educational arenas in order to provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care,\u201d Taneff and Sayers continued. \u201cOver time, the team of medical professionals advised our clients it might be best for Huxley to be placed with another family.\u201d",
      "In the adoption world, failed adoptions are called \u201cdisruptions.\u201d While a disruption may seem stone-hearted from the outside, according to experts TODAY.com spoke with, these  anguished acts are complex and soul-crushing for all concerned.",
      "Myka Stauffer responded to some of the backlash in an Instagram post on June 24, 2020. That screenshot remains the most recent post on her page.",
      "\"I am sorry for the confusion and pain I have caused, and I am sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning,\" she wrote, adding, \"I was naive, foolish and arrogant.\"",
      "She also debunked a few rumors, writing that the Stauffers \"did not adopt a child to gain wealth.\"",
      "The new, three-episode documentary airing this week called \"An Update On Our Family\" looks at the broader world of family vlogging through the lens of the Stauffer family's story."

      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m going to feel nervous \u2014 which, to be honest, I haven\u2019t been since my first day (at TODAY). I\u2019ve felt nerves here and there, but not real nervousness. Not, \u2018Holy moly, what are we starting?\u2019 And that\u2019s the sign of something super exciting.\u201d",
      "So long to \u2018Hoda & Jenna\u2019",
      "Jenna remembers the day in September 2024 Hoda asked\u00a0to meet in her office; she had something to tell her. When Jenna got there, a candle was burning. There, before the rest of the world knew, Hoda broke the news: She was moving on from TODAY. At age 60, she was ready to spend more time with her young children.",
      "Jenna\u2019s first reaction?",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Wait, you can\u2019t, you can\u2019t go.\u2019 And she said: \u2018...Well, I\u2019m going,\u2019\u201d Jenna says, laughing.",
      "Shocked by the news, Jenna immediately called her parents, former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush, in tears.",
      "\u201cI was crying in such a way that they thought something really bad had happened. When they found out that it was just that Hoda was ready to move on to other chapters, they said, \u2018Oh, Jenna, it\u2019s gonna be OK.\u2019 They basically said, \u2018This is your time. Enjoy it. You\u2019re ready for it,\u2019\u201d she says, calling them \u201cso supportive.\u201d",
      "Still, moving on from this \u201cwonderful, wonderful time\u201d has been a journey. Jenna says she has moved through the five stages of grief and has now reached the acceptance that eluded her when she first heard the news.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of Hoda. I think she\u2019s doing exactly what she needs to do at this moment for her.\u201d",
      "For Jenna, this is more than the loss of a co-host, but also the loss of a champion. When Jenna first appeared on TODAY in 2009, she was a 27-year-old grade school teacher in Baltimore who was on the show to promote \u201cAna\u2019s Story,\u201d a book she wrote about the 17-year-old single mother living with HIV/AIDs she had met while working as a UNICEF intern in Latin America.",
      "An executive producer thought Jenna had the right spark for TV \u2014 and Hoda agreed. \u201cI never thought I would\u2019ve hosted an hour. But Hoda saw that in me,\u201d Jenna says, adding that through the years, Hoda helped her push past insecurities."

      "\u201cGomez is critiqued for experiencing the typical challenges of heritage speakers while being held to native speaker standards \u2014 a no-win situation that a rapidly growing number of Americans can relate to,\u201d Abbott wrote in a recent opinion piece for The Fulcrum.",

      "According to the study, 54% of U.S. Latinos who say that only speak a little Spanish \u201csay another Hispanic person has made them feel bad for it.\u201d",
      "However, one commenter on X responding to Abbott argued that the issue wasn\u2019t with Gomez's language ability or identity, but with the fact that her Spanish skills did not match the demands of her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe author misses the point completely. This has nothing to do with racism. Selena Gomez should be proud of her Spanish,\u201d the X user wrote. \u201cBut her accent doesn\u2019t match the character that she plays in the movie. And that\u2019s very distracting for viewers who know exactly how Mexicans speak.\u201d",
      "Director Audiard has addressed issues with the actors' varying Spanish accents in the movie.",
      "\u201cThroughout the shoot we had problems, for instance, with Selena\u2019s accent in Spanish. She is Texan. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n speaks Castilian Spanish. She\u2019s from Madrid,\u201d he told The New York Times in November. \u201cGiven that I don\u2019t speak Spanish, the nuances of the Mexican accent versus the Castilian were lost on me. We had all these problems with accents, but we fixed them in the edit. We did a lot of dubbing.\u201d",
      "Some argue the movie perpetuates harmful trans stereotypes",
      "Some viewers have criticized the movie\u2019s depiction of trans people and the trans experience.",
      "GLAAD, the LGBTQ advocacy group formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, called \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\" a \u201cstep backward for trans representation\u201d and said the film \u201crecycles the trans stereotypes, tropes, and clich\u00e9s of the not-so-distant past.\u201d",
      "Some critics say the film perpetuates the harmful narrative that transitioning is a form of lying. Emilia keeps her past a secret from her wife, posing as Manitas' aunt.",
      "\u201cIts protagonist\u2019s transition is seen as duplicitous and dishonest, an act of manipulation through which she continues her selfish attempts to control those that she abandoned,\u201d Mattie Lucas wrote in a November review for Trans | Cendental Cinema.",
      "\u201cNot only is her transition portrayed as more of a disguise to evade the authorities, it\u2019s an act of continued selfishness that ends up destroying not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves,\u201d Lucas added.",
      "Film critic Juan Barquin called the movie \u201ca regressive picture masquerading as progressive\u201d and criticized the way masculinity and femininity were portrayed in the film.",
      "\u201cAny time Emilia \u2018reverts\u2019 to her \u2018old ways,\u2019 Gascon lowers her vocal register as if to equate masculinity with evil and femininity with good,\u201d Barquin wrote for Little White Lies magazine.",
      "Reviewer David Opie echoed this criticism, pointing to a scene when Emilia throws her wife Jessi onto a bed \u201cand threatens her using the same low, masculine voice she used pre-surgery.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s as if the so-called 'evil' in Emilia is a separate entity, the 'man' she was raised to be, rather than her being the same person going through a transitional journey,\u201d Opie wrote for Yahoo! Movies.",
      "Several critics and viewers, including Barquin, also took issue with one line from the movie in which Emilia describes herself as \u201chalf male, half female.\u201d",
      "Some transgender commentators shared counterpoints to these arguments and defended the film\u2019s representation of its trans protagonist.",
      "Journalist and critic Mey Rude, who is trans, rejected the argument that Emilia uses a \u201cmale voice\u201d in moments of anger.",
      "\u201cShe simply is a woman with a lower register, and when she gets angry, it shows,\u201d Rude wrote in a piece for Out Magazine. \u201cIf you listen to the scenes where Gasc\u00f3n is playing the character as Manitas, you can clearly hear a difference in the voice she uses in the fight scene with Gomez.\u201d",
      "Rude also argues that the film does not lean into \u201charmful trans tropes about trans women being deceptive or liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia isn\u2019t a liar because she\u2019s trans, she\u2019s a liar because she\u2019s a bad person and she\u2019s in many ways, afraid,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe movie shows that if you live a lie, whether you\u2019re trans or not, your lies will catch up with you.\u201d",
      "Writer Julie River, who is trans, argues in a piece for Out Front magazine that Emilia is portrayed sensitively as a \u201cmorally complex\u201d character who makes \u201ca desperate attempt to atone for her sins in her former life.\u201d",
      "River also argues that Emilia hides her transition not because the movie is painting trans people as duplicitous, but because as a cartel leader, Emilia \"was hardly surrounded by people who were easy to come out to or who were likely to accept her transition.\u201d",
      "\u201cI may be amongst the minority in the LGBTQ+ community doing this, but I\u2019ll be applauding it for every award it wins,\u201d River wrote.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n herself has pushed back at people calling her \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d character transphobic.",
      "\u201cThere are some that say, \u2018I want to see LGBTQ or trans characters outdoing what people do in real life,\u2019 but we do bad things too ... I don\u2019t understand the criticism about the representation of portraying Emilia P\u00e9rez this way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair in January. \u201cThe reality is that the trans experience is not the same for everybody \u2014 my trans experience is different from somebody else\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go and make your own movie,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n also said. \u201cGo create the representation you want to see for your community.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Israel and Hamas appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to a ceasefire deal Wednesday that could end 15 months of devastating fighting in the Gaza Strip, even as the Israel military continued to launch airstrikes in the enclave and families of Israeli hostages begged for their safe return.",
      "American, Egyptian and Qatari delegations have been working to secure a truce to end fighting, with officials familiar with the talks taking place in the Qatari capital of Doha saying that an agreement that would see the gradual release of dozens of hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners was on the verge of completion.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said that Hamas had not yet responded to the draft agreement, after reports of a breakthrough in Israeli media.",
      "Earlier Wednesday a senior Arab official familiar with negotiations told NBC News that three key points were still being negotiated: the map dictating where exactly Israeli forces will withdraw to, particularly along the Netzarim Corridor that currently splits the Gaza Strip in two; the extent of its withdrawal from the strategic Philadelphi Corridor that flanks Gaza's southern border with Egypt; and the names of Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for Hamas' Oct. 7 captives, as well as the method and location of their release.",
      "Netanyahu's spokesman, David Mencer, told NBC News on Wednesday that the deal was \"awaiting Hamas agreement.\u201d",
      "That comment came after Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said Tuesday that a majority within Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government would support the \u201cgradual deal\u201d being negotiated.",
      "Earlier in the day, a senior Israeli official gave details of the current plans, which involve a 42-day first phase in which 33 hostages, most of whom are believed to be alive, would be exchanged for Palestinian prisoners. That would be followed by a \"more complicated\" second phase, Sa\u2019ar said.",
      "The official added that the Israel Defense Forces would also withdraw from central Gaza to the Israeli border, but not before the hostages are freed.",
      "Of the 251 hostages kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, 94 people are still being held in Gaza \u2014 34 of whom have died.",
      "The first 33 hostages, defined as \u201chumanitarian cases,\u201d would be released during the first phase of the deal, a senior Israeli official told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Fighting began in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas carried out a terror attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. That saw Israel launch an air and land assault on Gaza, killing more than 46,000 people, most of them civilians, according to local officials.",
      "President Joe Biden said this week that a deal to end the war was \u201con the brink\u201d of being completed.\u00a0Washington is looking to secure the deal before President-elect Donald Trump takes office Monday.",
      "Until that happens, though, the violence continues. At least 17 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza late Tuesday, according to the enclave\u2019s Health Ministry. A separate Israeli strike on Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, killed at least six people, the ministry said.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement it had \u201cstruck more than 50 terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip, including terrorist cells, weapons storage facilities, underground infrastructure, anti-tank fire positions, and Hamas military structures.\u201d",
      "Alongside the Palestinians desperate for this bombardment to end, Israelis have for months begged their government to bring home their relatives who were kidnapped by Hamas on Oct. 7. They have often been deeply critical of Netanyahu, whom they accuse of prioritizing the war and keeping together his fractious right-wing coalition government over the safety of their loved ones.",
      "As they have throughout this conflict, thousands of people gathered Tuesday night in the Tel Aviv plaza that has in recent months become known as \u201cHostages Square.\u201d Among them was Moran Stela Yanai, who spent 54 days in captivity after being abducted at the Supernova music festival on the morning of Hamas' surprise attack.",
      "\u201cI appeal to you, the international community, with a simple yet urgent plea: help us bring the hostages home,\u201d she said, according to a statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "\u201cThis is not about politics\u2014it is about humanity and the shared belief that no one should be left behind in darkness,\u201d she added. \u201cThese are children, parents, brothers, and sisters\u2014individuals with dreams, hopes, and loved ones longing for their return.\u201d",
      "The Bibas family said they had read reports that their relatives were among those set to be freed. Yarden Bibas, his wife Shiri and their sons Ariel, 5, and Kfir, 1, were taken from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on Oct. 7.",
      "\"We have learned from experience and disappointment, and therefore, until our loved ones cross the border, there is no end to the story,\" the family said in a statement. \"We are waiting for certainty regarding their release and their condition and ask that you do not contact us during this sensitive period.\""

      "Biden, who will leave office next week, said that his administration was \"working urgently\" to solidify a deal that would bring an end to the deadly fighting in Gaza and see the release of hostages held by Hamas. Israeli's military offensive in Gaza, launched after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 terrorist attack which Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, has now dragged on for more than 15 months and killed more than 46,500 in the enclave, according to local health authorities.",

      "It \u201cremains a very challenging, often very contentious and in a long-term way deeply competitive relationship,\u201d Ambassador Nicholas Burns told NBC News in an interview this week. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t get around that. We\u2019re rivals for global power.\u201d",
      "Still, the world\u2019s two biggest economies have learned that \u201cwe\u2019ve got to talk to each other,\u201d Burns said, adding that \u201cthere are times when we have to work with China because it\u2019s in the American national interest.\u201d",
      "China is increasingly challenging the U.S.-led international order that has been in place since the end of World War II, working to various degrees with Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "The two countries have profound differences on issues such as trade, technology, the status of Taiwan and human rights, and blame each other for cyberattacks and the deadly U.S. fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s been unduly provocative in the Taiwan Strait with its military maneuvers,\u201d Burns said, adding that Beijing \u201chas made a major mistake and continues with that mistake in helping Russia to prosecute its illegal and barbaric war against Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Beijing denies that it is aiding the Russian war machine or carrying out cyberattacks on the U.S. that Burns said are \u201con a scale of lethality that is unprecedented.\u201d",

      "One thing the Chinese government can do, he said, is lift its sanctions on Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., if he is confirmed as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state. Rubio and other U.S. lawmakers were sanctioned in 2020 over their criticism of authorities\u2019 crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",

      "Trump has advocated a tougher approach toward the country than the Biden administration.",
      "In what may be indirect advice to Trump and his Cabinet appointees, Burns emphasized the importance of talking with China as well as maintaining regional alliances the Biden administration has fortified in order to counter China\u2019s influence, the future of which is uncertain as Trump begins a second term.",
      "\u201cWe have got to keep our allies close to us,\u201d Burns said, pointing to South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Australia and India.",
      "Working with allies \u201cmultiplies and expands American power in trying to deter some of these really pernicious actions\u201d by China, Russia and others, Burns said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one way to compete with China effectively, to win part of the competition for power, but also to keep the peace with China,\u201d he said.",
      "Slowly thawing ties",
      "In-person diplomacy was disrupted during the Covid-19 pandemic, which kept China\u2019s borders closed for three years. During this time, the previous Trump administration ratcheted up criticism of Beijing\u2019s handling of the outbreak, which began in China.",
      "When Burns arrived in Beijing in March 2022 to take up his post, he spent most of the first month of his job in quarantine at the ambassador\u2019s residence, unable to meet anybody even as the relationship he was tasked with steering was heading to new lows.",
      "At the same time, Chinese nationalism and anti-Western sentiment surged across state media and online platforms here, and the people-to-people exchanges that Burns likes to call the \u201cballast\u201d of the relationship have never really recovered.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has the tightest grip on power here since Mao Zedong, and has carried out an internal campaign against corruption that, during Burns\u2019 term alone, saw a foreign minister and two defense ministers expelled from their positions and the public eye. The heightened scrutiny has made some Chinese officials, academics and average citizens more reluctant to engage with foreigners.",
      "Relations hit their lowest point in decades in August 2022, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House speaker at the time, visited the Beijing-claimed island of Taiwan over China\u2019s objections. They sank even lower in early 2023, when the American military shot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that had been spotted over the continental United States.",
      "\u201cIt took us a while to dig out of that,\u201d Burns said. Since then, both sides have moved to stabilize ties.",

      "Another example of improved cooperation, he said, is in addressing the U.S. fentanyl crisis, one of the areas where Biden and Xi agreed to cooperate at a summit in California in November 2023. Many of the precursor chemicals used to make the deadly opioid originate in China before being processed into fentanyl in Mexico and other countries, then smuggled into the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have begun to see action from the government of China,\u201d Burns said, including 300 arrests, the shutdown of online sales of illicit chemicals and the scheduling of 55 synthetic opioids and precursor chemicals as prohibited for export.",
      "Burns pointed to other successes in the Biden administration, including the release of four Americans who had been detained in China for years: David Lin in September, and Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung in November.",

      "To add insult to injury, when she discussed her misfortune on the French television channel TF1, the 53-year-old interior designer known only as \"Anne\" was hit with a wave of mockery and trolling so bad that the station had to pull her interview with its \"Seven to Eight\" show.",
      "\u201cThe story broadcast this Sunday has resulted in a wave of harassment against the witness,\u201d TF1 presenter Harry Roselmack posted on his X account Tuesday. \u201cFor the protection of victims, we have decided to withdraw it from our platforms.\u201d",

      "The request for money came after the scammers told Anne that Pitt was in the hospital with kidney cancer and needed money for the treatment, but that his bank accounts were allegedly frozen because of his divorce proceedings with ex-wife Angelina Jolie.",
      "She was hesitant at first, but eventually transferred the large sum of money to an account in Turkey after receiving an email from the fake star\u2019s \u201cdoctor.\u201d",
      "Anne said she finally realized she had been the victim of a scam after she saw pictures of the real Pitt with his current partner, In\u00e8s de Ramon, last summer. \u201cI ask myself why they chose me to do such harm like this?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never harmed anyone. These people deserve hell.\u201d",
      "The French newspaper\u00a0Sud Ouest reported that Anne was going through divorce proceedings with a millionaire entrepreneur at the time. She reportedly suffered from severe depression and was hospitalized following the scam.",

      "At least 78 illegal miners have been pulled out dead from a South African mine where police blocked food and water supplies for months in what trade unions described as a \u201chorrific\u201d state crackdown on desperate people trying to eke out a living.",
      "A total of 78 bodies and 166 survivors \u2014 some of them emaciated and disorientated \u2014 have been hauled out so far in a court-ordered rescue operation that began on Monday, with hundreds more men still stuck 1.5 miles below the surface in a gold mine at Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg.",
      "Police had stopped food and water supplies from being taken into the mine since August until a court ruled in December that volunteers could send down essential aid for the miners, known locally as \u201czama zamas\u201d.",
      "\u201cOur mandate was to combat criminality and that is exactly what we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d said Athlenda Mathe, national spokesperson for the South African police, speaking at the site.",
      "\u201cBy providing food, water and necessities to these illegal miners it would be the police entertaining and allowing criminality to thrive,\u201d she said.",
      "The death toll makes the crackdown on the Stilfontein mine one of the deadliest on miners in recent South African history. As the toll has mounted, so has criticism of the police and of the government, which says the siege was part of a much-needed crackdown on illegal mining.",
      "\u201cThese miners, many of them undocumented and desperate workers from Mozambique and other Southern African countries, were left to die in one of the most horrific displays of state wilful negligence in recent history,\u201d the South African Federation of Trade Unions said in a statement on Tuesday.",
      "The Democratic Alliance, the second-biggest party in the ruling coalition, said on Wednesday the situation at the mine had got \u201cbadly out of hand\u201d and called for an independent inquiry.",
      "All 166 of the survivors rescued so far were immediately arrested and charged with criminal offences including illegal immigration, trespass and illegal mining, police said. None were hospitalized and all were taken into police custody.",
      "\u201cIf you come out and you are able to walk they take you straight to the cells,\u201d said Mzukisi Jam, a civil society activist, who has been at the site throughout the rescue operation."

    "story": [
      "At a news conference this month, President-elect Donald Trump bragged, \u201cWe defeated ISIS.\u201d",
      "It has been a point of pride for him, and it is true. In the first year of Trump\u2019s first term,\u00a0U.S. forces, working with Syrian Kurdish allies,\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Islamic State\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201ccaliphate\u201d and liberated\u00a0its capital. But the fall of the Assad regime has left Syria at risk of coming apart under pressure from a variety of terrorist groups, local militias and Israeli airstrikes. And Syria\u2019s interim leaders, while proclaiming moderate intentions, have roots\u00a0in Al Qaeda and\u00a0another terrorist group, Hayat al Sham (HTS). The\u00a0nightmare scenario for many experts is that\u00a0ISIS could re-establish its stronghold in the fledgling state and export more terrorism to the West or inspire it, as it did the New Year\u2019s Day attack in New Orleans.",
      "The situation means that, once he is in office,\u00a0Trump will\u00a0most likely\u00a0have to make some hard choices \u2014\u00a0insist on withdrawing all or some of the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, in line with his previous positions,\u00a0or leave them in place to prevent an ISIS resurgence and a tarnishing of what he sees as his accomplishment in his first term. U.S. withdrawal\u00a0could easily re-create Syria as a base of operations for terrorist attacks\u00a0in\u00a0Israel, the United States and Europe.",
      "The United States has been relying on fighters from the\u00a0Syrian Defense Force (SDF),\u00a0an alliance led by Kurds\u00a0in northeast Syria,\u00a0to guard thousands of\u00a0captured\u00a0ISIS\u00a0fighters and their families\u00a0there. At the height of the war\u00a0against ISIS, Gen. Joseph Votel, a former commander of U.S. Central Command,\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that the SDF\u2019s fighters were among the best he has ever led.",
      "But the SDF\u2019s commander in chief, Gen. Mazloum\u00a0Abdi,\u00a0told The Guardian this\u00a0month\u00a0that ISIS is growing in strength after it seized weapons from the collapsed\u00a0Syrian\u00a0regime. He\u00a0also\u00a0said the Kurdish forces are coming under increased pressure from\u00a0Turkish\u00a0President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who views them, along with\u00a0Kurdish separatists based in Syria\u00a0known as the PKK,\u00a0as threats\u00a0to his regime.",
      "Outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken said\u00a0Monday in an interview with NBC News that the U.S. role in helping guide and shape what is happening in Syria is \u201cessential.\u201d",
      "Blinken described the situation on the ground as \u201cincredibly fragile,\u201d warning that \u201cwhat happens inside of Syria doesn\u2019t stay inside of Syria,\u201d with the potential for terrorism that goes well beyond its borders.",
      "The United States has a stake in the \u201cextraordinary opportunity that is now before the Syrian people to actually control their own lives and their own destinies,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cThat means, I believe, keeping some presence, but it also means being very engaged in all of the efforts to help support a Syrian-owned, Syrian-led transition to get the country to a better place.\u201d",
      "Theodore\u00a0Kattouf,\u00a0a career diplomat who was the U.S. ambassador to Syria under President George W. Bush,\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0recently\u00a0that even if Trump were to continue bombing campaigns and targeted operations against the terrorist group, removing U.S. troops would leave the Kurdish coalition vulnerable and ultimately lead to an expanded footprint for ISIS.",
      "\u201cWith those troops out of there, we\u2019re putting a lot of U.S. interests at risk,\u201d\u00a0Kattouf\u00a0said. \u201cI don\u2019t see\u00a0[HTS]\u00a0or other allied rebel forces able to take on that issue right now.\u201d",
      "The fear among Biden administration counterterrorism officials\u00a0is that\u00a0a Trump withdrawal of U.S. forces would leave the Syrian Kurds guarding the ISIS prisoners vulnerable to attacks from other factions \u2014 or the looming presence of Turkey, just across the border.\u00a0Both\u00a0Trump in his first term and President Joe Biden\u00a0have worked hard to restrain Erdo\u011fan,\u00a0whose country remains\u00a0a NATO ally, from attacking America\u2019s Kurdish allies. Trump said\u00a0at his news conference last week that\u00a0he had asked Erdo\u011fan\u00a0not to\u00a0go\u00a0after \u201ccertain people,\u201d clearly referring to the Kurds. Trump added, \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan\u00a0is his friend of mine, he\u2019s a guy I like, respect. I think he respects me also.\u201d",
      "Beyond serving as a base for operations and planning, any Syrian territory that falls to ISIS could help it project an image of power and resistance and inspire others around the world. The group has already been\u00a0expanding its global\u00a0reach through social media, sponsoring attacks and\u00a0influencing followers worldwide, including so-called lone wolves,\u00a0through what anti-terrorism experts say is a surge of sophisticated online propaganda. CIA Director William Burns\u00a0told NPR\u00a0last\u00a0week\u00a0that\u00a0the agency is \u201cquite concerned\u201d about the rising threat posed by ISIS, particularly its \u201cability to inspire people.\u201d\u00a0And in July, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned the House Judiciary Committee that \u201cthe greatest terrorism threat to our homeland has been posed by lone actors or small cells of individuals who typically radicalize to violence online and use easily accessible weapons to attack soft targets.\u201d",
      "The U.S. intelligence community\u00a0and the FBI have been sounding those alarm bells for more than a year.\u00a0A senior administration official\u00a0told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Friday, \u201cThere is a heightened focus on ISIS,\u201d pointing to the cancellation of three Taylor Swift Eras Tour shows in Vienna in August after warnings from U.S. intelligence of ISIS terrorist plots targeting the venues. And in March, gunmen from ISIS-K, an affiliate of ISIS based in Afghanistan, killed more than 130 people at the Crocus City Hall, a well-known concert venue outside Moscow, despite warnings from U.S. intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cSyria could provide the group with the momentum that it\u2019s long sought to kind of spill back onto the headlines, whether that\u2019s ISIS K in Afghanistan, ISIS core, ISIS Central and Syria and parts of Iraq, and again, the homegrown violent extremists that live in the West that ISIS is attempting to push over the edge conduct the types of attack that we saw in New Orleans,\u201d counterterrorism\u00a0expert\u00a0Collin Clarke\u00a0of the Soufan Group\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0after the New Orleans attack.",
      "Clearly alarmed by the possibility of the collapsed state\u2019s exporting terrorism to Europe,\u00a0two weeks ago\u00a0the foreign ministers of France and Germany, representing the European Union, traveled to Damascus to meet Syria\u2019s interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa,\u00a0who was\u00a0known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, before he disavowed his connections with\u00a0HTS.",
      "American boots?",
      "\u201cSyria is a mess, but is not our friend,\u201d Trump said on X in the hours before the collapse of the Assad regime, adding, \u201cThe United States should have nothing to do with it. This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pick for national security adviser,\u00a0Rep. Mike Waltz,\u00a0R-Fla.,\u00a0echoed Trump\u2019s reluctance for the United States to intervene in Syria but underscored the incoming administration\u2019s commitment to combating ISIS. \u201cWe do not need American boots running around Syria in any way, shape or form, but we\u2019re keeping an eye on those things, ISIS, Israel\u2019s border, and kind of the broader dynamic with our Gulf allies,\u201d Waltz said on a podcast late last month.",
      "But experts question the ability to continue the fight against ISIS in Syria without a U.S.\u00a0military\u00a0presence.",
      "During the transition, a senior Biden administration official said, the current administration has been briefing Trump\u2019s national security team on the need for a continued U.S. military presence to prevent Russia, Turkey or Iran from gaining dominance. The outgoing Biden administration has itself been treading carefully, sending its top Middle East diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State Barbara\u00a0Leaf, to Damascus only after European counterparts had already visited and only after\u00a0public pressure\u00a0from the mother of Austin Tice, the American journalist believed to be imprisoned in Syria,\u00a0who said\u00a0the United States should be more engaged.\u00a0To even meet with the new interim leader, the State Department first\u00a0had to lift\u00a0the\u00a0$10\u00a0million bounty\u00a0it\u00a0had\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0his\u00a0head\u00a0when he led\u00a0HTS.",
      "But now the critical question of whether the United States should play a role in preventing Syria from again harboring terrorists or permitting power plays from U.S. regional adversaries will be on Trump\u2019s doorstep as he arrives at the White House. That and the challenge of combating the online propaganda that spreads ISIS\u2019 terrorist philosophy far and wide."

      "Starmer has been under growing pressure to remove Siddiq from her post since she referred herself to the government\u2019s ethics watchdog in early January following reports that she lived in London properties linked to her aunt.",
      "Starmer said he was sad to see Siddiq go, adding in a letter that the watchdog \u2014 independent adviser on ministerial interests Laurie Magnus \u2014 \u201chas assured me he found no breach of the Ministerial Code and no evidence of financial improprieties on your part.\u201d",
      "Starmer offered Siddiq the possibility of returning to government, saying \u201cthe door remains open to you going forward.\u201d",
      "Hasina was Bangladesh\u2019s longest-serving prime minister and ruled the country for 15 years until August 2024, when she was ousted amid a mass uprising in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands were injured. Hasina, who has fled to India, faces many court cases over the deaths, including some on charges of crimes against humanity.",
      "Siddiq, who is responsible for tackling corruption in financial markets, was named last month in an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh against Hasina. The investigation alleged that Siddiq\u2019s family was involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of money were said to have been embezzled.",
      "Magnus said he accepted \u201cat face value\u201d Siddiq\u2019s statement that \u201cshe had no involvement in any inter-governmental discussions between Bangladesh and Russia or any form of official role.\u201d",
      "The minister faced further questions about her links to her aunt\u2019s government after reports in the Sunday Times and Financial Times newspapers alleged that she had used two London apartments given to her by associates of Bangladesh\u2019s Awami League, led by Hasina.",
      "Magnus said \u201ca lack of records and lapse of time\u201d meant he had not seen all potentially relevant information, but added that \u201cI have not identified evidence of improprieties\u201d over the apartments.",
      "Magnus concluded that Siddiq hadn\u2019t breached ministerial standards. But he noted that given her role in government \u201cit is regrettable that she was not more alert to the potential reputational risks \u2014 both to her and the government \u2014 arising from her close family\u2019s association with Bangladesh.\u201d"

      "The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading a joint investigation, said the arrest warrant was executed at 10:33 a.m. (8:33 p.m. Tuesday ET), hours after hundreds of police officers arrived at Yoon\u2019s presidential compound in central Seoul.",
      "Yoon, who was impeached last month after his short-lived martial law order plunged South Korea, a key U.S. ally, into political chaos, is South Korea\u2019s first president to be arrested in office.",
      "\u201cUnlike the first execution attempt, this time there were no individuals or security staff actively obstructing the execution, and there were no significant physical clashes,\u201d the CIO said in a briefing.",
      "In an address to the nation, Yoon said that the warrant was illegal but that he decided to comply \u201cto prevent an unfortunate and bloody confrontation.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for Yoon and lawmakers from his People Power Party were also on the access road leading to the residence, arguing that the warrant was illegal and blocking the police from progressing toward the residence\u2019s entrance.",
      "Nearby, thousands of Yoon\u2019s supporters and critics held dueling protests in below-freezing temperatures.

      "Police officers could later be seen making progress toward the hillside villa after they pushed through multiple blockades made up of vehicles and barbed wire.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal team said Wednesday that he was willing to appear for questioning voluntarily rather than be taken into custody. But a convoy of black SUVs was later seen leaving the presidential compound with a police escort, and Yoon arrived at the CIO office shortly afterward."

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Cuba said it will release 553 political prisoners after the Biden administration announced Tuesday it is removing Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and taking other \u201cgoodwill\u201d actions.",
      "The Catholic Church had been negotiating with the communist-run government over the release of the prisoners. Most of them were jailed following unprecedented islandwide protests in July 2021. A brutal crackdown initially led to the arrests of more than 1,000 people. Many faced prison sentences of up to 30 years.",
      "\"I thank all those who contributed to the decision announced today by the United States to remove Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, where it should never have been,\" Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel wrote on X. \"Together with two other measures adopted, they have had a high cost for the country and Cuban families.\"",
      "Before Cuba's announcement, a senior administration official told reporters that to support the Catholic Church and facilitate the agreement, Biden would notify Congress that he seeks to remove Cuba from the terrorism list, as well as to take other actions.",
      "\u201cAn assessment has been completed, and we do not have information that supports Cuba\u2019s designation as being a state sponsor of terrorism,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump designated Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism shortly before he left office in January 2021, five years after President Barack Obama removed it. Trump can reverse Biden\u2019s actions as soon as he takes office next week.",
      "Three Cuban American Republican members of Congress from Florida, Mario D\u00edaz Balart, Maria Elvira Salaz\u00e1r and Carlos Gimenez, posted a video on X, rejecting Biden's moves and calling them \"pathetic.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, whose father is Cuban, criticized Biden\u2019s actions. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is unacceptable on its merits,\u201d he wrote in a statement. \u201cThe terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.\u201d",
      "In Cuba, Havana residents welcomed the news about Biden's actions.",
      "\"This is definitely good for our country, because we would have more possibilities, more resources. It's an advancement. One step at a time,\" said Dainerys Hern\u00e1ndez, a bartender.",
      "Joel Rivera, a public worker, agreed. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good decision. It\u2019s true that we need to be taken off that list, because we shouldn't be there in the first place,\" he said.",
      "In addition to removing Cuba from the list, the Biden administration will issue a waiver for Title III of the Helms Burton Act, which allows the original owners of Cuban properties confiscated decades ago to sue foreign companies \u201ctrafficking\u201d in them.",
      "In 2019, Trump was the first president not to waive Title III. Every president before him had waived the 1996 law, officially called the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, every six months, fearing it could harm U.S. trade.",
      "\u201cWe expect and anticipate that these measures announced today will bring very quick relief to the many dozens of Cubans who were arrested in conjunction with the July 2021 protests, as well as bring relief to their family members,\u201d the Biden official said.",
      "Biden is also easing some economic pressure on Cuba by rescinding National Security Presidential Memorandum 5, which was originally established on June 16, 2017.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions demonstrate that President Biden\u2019s Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,\u201d the senior administration official said.",
      "Speculation over Trump\u2019s foreign policy has swirled, particularly because of the potential influence of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a Cuban American who is Trump's pick for secretary of state. Rubio, a foreign policy hawk, has always advocated for a hard-line policy toward Cuba.",
      "Mauricio Claver-Carone, the architect of some of Trump's tough Latin America policies during his first administration, was chosen as special envoy for Latin America.",
      "CORRECTION (Jan. 14, 2025, 9:36 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the status of political prisoners in Cuba. They will be released; they have not been released."

      "A group of global experts is proposing a new way to define and diagnose\u00a0obesity, reducing the emphasis on the controversial body mass index and hoping to better identify people who need treatment for the\u00a0disease caused\u00a0by excess body fat.",
      "Under recommendations released Tuesday night, obesity would no longer be defined solely by BMI, a calculation of height and weight, but combined with other measurements, such as waist circumference, plus evidence of health problems tied to extra pounds.",
      "Obesity is estimated to affect more than 1 billion people\u00a0worldwide. In the U.S., about 40% of adults have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of this is to get a more precise definition so that we are targeting the people who actually need the help most,\u201d said Dr. David Cummings, an obesity expert at the University of Washington and one of the 58 authors of the report published in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal.",
      "The report introduces two new diagnostic categories: clinical obesity and pre-clinical obesity.",
      "People with clinical obesity meet BMI and other markers of obesity and have evidence of organ, tissue or other problems caused by excess weight. That could include heart disease, high blood pressure, liver or kidney disease or chronic severe knee or hip pain. These people would be eligible for treatments, including\u00a0diet\u00a0and\u00a0exercise\u00a0interventions and\u00a0obesity medications.",
      "People with pre-clinical obesity are at risk for those conditions, but have no ongoing illness, the report says.",
      "BMI has long been considered a flawed measure that can over-diagnose or underdiagnose obesity, which is currently defined as a BMI of 30 or more. But people with excess body fat do not always have a BMI above 30, the report notes. And people with high muscle mass \u2014 football players or other athletes \u2014 may have a high BMI despite normal fat mass.",
      "Under the new criteria, about 20% of people who used to be classified as obese would no longer meet the definition, preliminary analysis suggests. And about 20% of people with serious health effects but lower BMI would now be considered clinically obese, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t dramatically change the percentage of people being defined as having obesity, but it would better diagnose the people who really have clinically significant excess fat,\u201d Cummings said.",
      "The new definitions have been endorsed by more than 75 medical organizations around the world, but it\u2019s not clear how widely or quickly they could be adopted in practice. The report acknowledges that implementation of the recommendations \u201cwill carry significant costs and workforce implications.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for the health insurance trade group AHIP, formerly known as America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said \u201cit\u2019s too early at this point to gauge how plans will incorporate these criteria into coverage or other policies.\u201d",
      "There are practical issues to consider, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company FlyteHealth. Measuring waist circumference sounds simple, but protocols differ, many doctors aren\u2019t trained accurately and standard medical tape measures aren\u2019t big enough for many people with obesity.",
      "In addition, determining the difference between clinical and pre-clinical obesity would require a comprehensive health assessment and lab tests, she noted.",
      "\u201cFor a new classification system to be widely adopted, it would also need to be extremely quick, inexpensive, and reliable,\u201d she said.",
      "The new definitions are likely to be confusing, said Kate Bauer, a nutrition expert at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\u201cThe public likes and needs simple messages. I don\u2019t think this differentiation is going to change anything,\u201d she said.",
      "Overhauling the definition of obesity will take time, acknowledged Dr. Robert Kushner, an obesity expert at the Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine and a co-author of the report.",
      "\u201cThis is the first step in the process,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to begin the conversation.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II was not officially informed about the treachery of a senior palace courtier for nearly a decade, newly declassified documents reveal.",
      "Anthony Blunt served as the chief art curator to the royal family, surveying the queen\u2019s pictures, overseeing the paintings in the royal collection and occasionally exhibiting her private treasures to the public. He endeared himself to the queen, so much so that he was given a knighthood \u2014 despite the fact that he had lived a double life as a Soviet spy.",
      "The files, among a trove from the\u00a0intelligence agency MI5\u00a0that were released Tuesday by Britain\u2019s National Archives, shed new light on the Cold War scandal at the heart of the British establishment. The saga has long captivated historians and featured in popular culture, from spy novels to Netflix's \"The Crown.\"",
      "Blunt confessed in 1964 to spying for the Soviet Union as part of the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring during World War II, but the queen would only be told the full story in 1973 \u2014 responding calmly and without surprise, according to the documents. His true identity was eventually exposed to the public by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, speaking in Parliament in 1979.",
      "The security services closely guarded Blunt's identity given his prominent position, with only a few senior officials informed, though the secret may have been known regardless. The queen\u2019s private secretary, Martin Charteris, was told only that MI5 intended to interrogate Blunt due to his close ties with fellow spy Guy Burgess, who fled to the Soviet Union.",
      "In all likelihood, the events \u201ctell us more about the inability of the state to prosecute Blunt\u201d than a concerted effort by MI5 to keep the late queen in the dark, historian Chris Smith, who authored a biography of Cambridge Five spy John Cairncross, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cTo have informed Her Majesty or anyone else for that matter would have been potentially defamatory; it would also have been deemed embarrassing to Her Majesty,\u201d Smith said.",
      "By the time Blunt was revealed to have been a spy, he had also become the consummate establishment figure, \u201cwhich was acutely embarrassing\u201d for the royal family, Smith added.",
      "As such, concealing the information \u201cwould also have allowed the palace to truthfully deny that Her Majesty had any knowledge of Blunt\u2019s espionage activities, shielding her from personal embarrassment.\u201d"
