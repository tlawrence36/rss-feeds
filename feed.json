      "RoboCop has found a permanent home in Detroit \u2014 all 11 feet and 3,500 pounds of him",
      "DETROIT -- RoboCop has finally found a permanent home in Detroit.",
      "A statue looming 11 feet tall (3.3 meters) and weighing 3,500 pounds (1,587 kilograms) has been drawing fans since it began standing guard over the Motor City on Wednesday afternoon, after about 15 years in the making. Even in a snowstorm in the dark, people were driving by to see it, said Jim Toscano, co-owner of the FREE AGE film production company where the bronze-cast statue now stands bolted near the sidewalk.",
      "\u201cRoboCop\u201d hit theaters in 1987, portraying a near-future Detroit as crime-ridden and poorly protected by a beleaguered and outgunned police force, until actor Peter Weller appeared as a nearly invincible cyborg, created by a nefarious corporation bent on privatizing policing.",
      "There was a time when Detroit pushed back on anything pointing to its past reputation as an unsafe city, and the movie, which developed a cult following, spawning two sequels and a reboot, didn't help its image.",
      "But things have changed. Violent crime has been trending down for years. Homicide numbers have dropped below mid-1960s levels. And city officials offered no objections to the statue's installation, Toscano said.",
      "\u201cI think there will be a lot more acceptance,\u201d Toscano said. \u201cDetroit has come a long way. You put in a little nostalgia and that helps.\u201d",
      "The statue campaign appears to have started around 2010 when Detroit Mayor Dave Bing was tagged in a tweet that noted Philadelphia's statue of boxer Rocky Balboa and said RoboCop would be a \u201cGREAT ambassador for Detroit.\u201d",
      "Bing tweeted back, saying there were no such plans. But some Detroiters ran with the idea, crowdfunding it through a 2012 Kickstarter campaig n that raised more than $67,000 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide, and Detroit sculptor Giorgio Gikas finished the statue in 2017.",
      "Then, it got stuck, stored away from public view.",
      "The Michigan Science Center in Detroit ultimately nixed plans to host the sculpture in 2021, citing pressures from the coronavirus pandemic and the need to focus museum resources. Officials in Stevens Point, Wisconsin raised their hands, hoping to honor Weller, a native son of that city, by erecting it outside the police station or in a park.",
      "The search for a suitable home for RoboCop remained in limbo until about three years ago when Toscano's company bought a building in Eastern Market, an open-air produce market, shopping and entertainment district just northeast of downtown. Toscano says he thought they were \u201ckidding\u201d when he was contacted by the creator of the statue idea and Eastern Market officials. But he and his business partner gladly came on board: \u201cIt's too unusual, too unique, too cool not to do,\u201d Toscano said.",

      "On Thursday, James Campbell approached the statue and told three picture-takers: \u201cI own this. Do you guys know that?\u201d",
      "Campbell said he donated $100 to the original Kickstarter campaign over a decade ago, which makes him a \u201d.038 percent owner of this statue.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here to see this big, beautiful, bronze piece of art,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a piece of cinematic history to represent the city of Detroit.\u201d",
      "Asked why RoboCop is an appropriate symbol for the city, Campbell said: \u201cHe\u2019s a cyborg crime fighter! In the movie, in the futuristic Detroit, he\u2019s there to save the city. He\u2019s a symbol of hope.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- From the election of Zohran Mamdani to the intrigue surrounding the jewel heist at the Louvre, keeping up with this year's news also left some Americans struggling with pronunciations. That's put both the name of New York City's incoming mayor and the famed Paris museum on a list of the most mispronounced words in 2025.",
      "The language-learning company Babbel and closed-captioning company The Captioning Group on Thursday released a list of the words that news anchors, politicians and other public figures in the U.S. struggled with the most this year, giving an overview of the people and topics that had Americans talking.",
      "As Mamdani made his political rise, the democratic socialist's name often was mangled. When he takes office in January, the 34-year-old will become the city\u2019s first Muslim mayor, first born in Africa and first of South Asian heritage. Babbel said his name \u2014 which should be pronounced zoh-RAHN mam-DAH-nee \u2014 was most commonly mispronounced when people swapped the \u201cM\u201d and \u201cN\u201d in his last name.",

      "The theft of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre in October had many people mispronouncing the name of the world\u2019s most-visited museum. Babbel says the correct pronunciation is LOOV-ruh, with a very soft pronunciation on the \u201cruh,\u201d which can be a challenge for English speakers.",

      "Designer Matthieu Blazy has taken Chanel's fashions underground, with a runway show on a New York City subway platform",
      "NEW YORK -- Chanel\u2019s new showman, Matthieu Blazy, took his designs on the road Tuesday \u2014 or rather, underground, with a buzzy New York runway show staged on an actual subway platform.",
      "The designer, just weeks after his splashy Paris debut for Chanel in October, took over a decommissioned part of Manhattan's Bowery station for his first M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection. The annual show, which takes place in a different city each year, celebrates the craftsmanship of the artisans that partner with Chanel.",
      "In this case, it was two shows \u2014 one in the afternoon and one in the evening. And befitting the first Chanel shows in New York since 2018, there were VIPs aplenty: A$AP Rocky, Tilda Swinton, Ayo Edebiri, Rose Byrne, Kristen Stewart, Sofia Coppola, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Jessie Buckley, Margaret Qualley, Bowen Yang, Jon Bon Jovi and many others.",
      "The location had been a closely held secret. Guests entered via a doorway at 168 Bowery, and at first, it seemed like Chanel had perhaps decorated an event space to resemble a subway station, complete with tiled walls, turnstiles and a newsstand (with its own bespoke newspapers).",
      "But down a flight of stairs was the real platform. Guests settled into bleacher seats resembling subway benches. \u201cStand clear of the closing doors!\u201d came the announcement on the soundtrack, familiar to New Yorkers. Then a train came rolling in, and out of the cars came the models.",
      "The show was a marked contrast in vibe with the last M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art collection in New York in 2018, when the late designer Karl Lagerfeld took over the Egyptian Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for what felt like a mini-Met Gala, with clothes channeling the luxury of Egyptian royalty.",
      "Blazy was inspired not by royalty but by ordinary urban commuters, of different ages and types, coming together in a mashup of styles from different eras, from the 1920s onward.",
      "\u201cThe New York subway belongs to all,\u201d the designer said in his show notes. \"Everyone uses it. There are students and game-changers, statesmen and teenagers. It is a place full of wonderful encounters, a clash of pop archetypes.\u201d",
      "His models strolled the platform, some checking for arriving trains \u2014 feigning annoyance at their lateness \u2014 or leaning against a post as they waited. Their numbers increased until, by the end, there was a virtual rush hour of fashion, with the eclectic soundtrack playing the \u201cHappy Days\u201d theme song as a finale.",

      "Stewart, like others, had no idea going in what the show\u2019s theme would be, and thought the subway environment felt like \u201ca flurry of fleeting caught moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, \u2018Where is she going?\u2019 I wanted to go with them,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI believed in it. All of this is artifice, but when you do a really good impression of the truth, you find your own. This felt real to me.\u201d",
      "It was real enough that Chanel had printed its own \u201cnewspaper\u201d \u2014 called La Gazette \u2014 to accompany the show, with articles and interviews. An interview with Blazy quoted the designer as saying the collection was inspired partly by the 1931 visit to New York of Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel.",
      "And he sang the praises of the subway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s the vortex of the city,\" Blazy said. \"It connects everything.\u201d",

      "If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood\u2019s year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear",
      "NEW YORK -- If there were any doubt, the first few days of Hollywood's year-end awards has already made it abundantly clear: Paul Thomas Anderson's \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is the Oscar front-runner.",
      "On Monday, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d won best film at the 35th Gotham Awards. On Tuesday, it was named best film by the New York Film Critics Circle. On Wednesday, it swept the National Board of Review Awards, winning best film, best director for Anderson and acting awards for Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and newcomer Chase Infiniti.",
      "Expect to hear this pun a lot: one award after another.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d Anderson said at the Gothams. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",
      "That may be the first, and last, time Anderson can say that this awards season.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of political resistance in the face of recurring oppression, has firmly established itself as the movie of the moment. With an opening scene depicting a raid at an immigrant detention facility, Anderson's opus has struck critics and moviegoers, alike, for its contemporary relevance in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term. Even foes of the film, like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, have predicted it will \u201cwin all the Academy Awards.\u201d",
      "Yet Anderson's film is, in many ways, an Academy Awards oddity. It's a critically acclaimed release that skipped film festivals. It's a big-budget studio movie that wasn't a hit. In fact, should \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d go on to win at the March 15 Oscars, it could be one of the only money-losers to ever win the industry's top honor.",
      "Smaller films have, increasingly, won best picture. That includes indies like \u201cThe Hurt Locker,\u201d \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cNomadland\u201d \u2014 much-praised films with minuscule box office. Hollywood long ago got used to honoring films that exist largely outside its mainstream, franchise-obsessed business. And the notion of what constitutes a best-picture movie has grown elastic. \u201cParasite,\u201d\u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once\u201d and, the most recent winner, \u201cAnora,\u201d have all shaken traditional notions of Oscar material.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d represents something different. With a production budget of at least $130 million (some reports have it much higher) and another $70 million in marketing costs, it will have to have an extraordinary after-theater life to break even. Thus far, the Warner Bros. release has made $70.6 million domestically and $131.6 million overseas \u2014 great sums for an adult-oriented, R-rated, auteur-driven film that runs nearly three hours.",
      "Still, Variety earlier estimated \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will lose $100 million, a figure that Warner Bros. has disputed. It's too harsh a label, but such a discrepancy could make \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d tagged as the first best picture-winning flop.",
      "Awards season has a long way to go. None of the awards dished out this week has any direct correlation with academy voters. Some contenders, like A24's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d have yet to hit theaters. Others, like Focus Features' \u201cHamnet,\u201d are just arriving. Support is also strong for another Warner Bros. title, Ryan Coogler's \u201cSinners,\u201d which might pose the stiffest competition for \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d Both films are returning to IMAX screens on Dec. 12.",
      "But a bottom line in the red is far from a unique cross to bear this fall. Aside from the blockbuster launches of \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d waves of would-be awards contenders \u2014 films like \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d \u201cRoofman\u201d and \u201cChristy\u201d\u2014 have fizzled with ticket buyers. It's been a grueling fall for a wide spectrum of contenders, a context that makes \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d comparatively, a smash success.",
      "The biggest financial ding against it, really, is that it cost a lot \u2014 arguably too much \u2014 to make. At a time when so few films anything like \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d get greenlit, let alone with such budgets, the cost of \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d could even be seen as a badge of honor. Here is a movie that win, lose or draw, is in the fight for a kind of moviemaking that's under siege. To quote DiCaprio's Bob Ferguson: \u201cViva la revolution!\u201d",

      "The Kennedy Center, known for theater and opera, becomes the sports world's focus on Friday",
      "WASHINGTON -- On Friday afternoon, the Kennedy Center, best known for its theater, opera and ballet, will be the unlikely center of the sports world when the matchups for next year's World Cup are announced there. By Sunday, in a quick pivot, the venue will assume its more traditional role as the host of the annual awards program honoring some of the top artists in the U.S.",
      "The culture headsnap has one thing in common: President Donald Trump's starring role.",
      "Trump was instrumental in working with FIFA President Gianni Infantino to move the draw to the Kennedy Center after it was widely expected to take place in Las Vegas. FIFA may further recognize Trump at the event with a newly created peace prize. Infantino hasn't confirmed that Trump will be the recipient but the two have forged a notably close relationship and Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize. On the same day last month that FIFA said it would issue the new award, Infantino called Trump a \u201cclose friend\" who has \u201csuch an incredible energy.\u201d",
      "If the prospect of a peace prize isn't enough attention, Trump will assume a role played in the past by the broadcasting legend Walter Cronkite and other luminaires by hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, if current plans hold. When Trump announced the honorees at the Kennedy Center in August, he cast himself as reluctantly taking on the duties at the request of his chief of staff.",
      "\u201cI've been asked to host,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, I\u2019m the President of the United States. Are you fools asking me to do that? Sir, you\u2019ll get much higher ratings. I said 'I don\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "There are few recent parallels to the fervor that's about to descend on the Kennedy Center. When the U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, the draw was held in Las Vegas and Bill Clinton, the president at the time, didn't attend. When presidents participate in the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 Trump skipped the event during his first term \u2014 they generally stay in their box, wave to the audience and cheer the honorees.",
      "This week's lineup is a reminder that for Trump \u2014 a two-term president, bestselling author and onetime reality television star \u2014 his favorite role is that of a showman. And Trump's transformation of the Kennedy Center from one of Washington's relatively apolitical spaces into something of an extension of his White House affords him a natural stage.",
      "The shift at the Kennedy Center began quickly after Trump's return to Washington in late January. Within a month, he ousted the institution\u2019s leadership, filled the board of trustees with his supporters and announced he had been elected the board\u2019s chair.",
      "Trump and his aides criticized the Kennedy Center's programming as \u201cwoke\" and accused the previous leadership of financial mismanagement and neglecting the building. Some renovations have been underway in recent weeks, including using white paint over columns that were previously gold.",
      "Deborah Rutter, who was fired as the Kennedy Center's president, said in a May statement that allegations of poor financial management were \u201cfalse\u201d and insisted that when she left, \u201cthe Kennedy Center was fiscally sound.\u201d",
      "But the fallout has been intense with prominent musicals such as \u201cHamilton\u201d canceling performances. Actor Issa Rae and author Louise Penny also withdrew from appearances while consultants such as musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming resigned. Some artists have expressed a sense of sadness at the changes.",
      "\u201cIt was always a joy to be asked to perform at the Kennedy Center,\u201d Jane Alexander, an actor and former chair of the National Endowment for the Arts, told The Associated Press.",
      "For its part, the Kennedy Center's new leadership has said it is focusing on programming that appeals to a broad audience and doesn't lose money. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell has emphasized \u201ccommon sense\u201d programming.",
      "But Democrats in Congress are scrutinizing whether the new management is ultimately costing the Kennedy Center money. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents last month showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",

      "NEW YORK -- Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d was crowned best feature film and the dissident Iranian director Jafar Panahi won three awards Monday at the 35th annual Gotham Awards, a starry kickoff to the film industry\u2019s awards season.",
      "The Gothams, presented by the Gotham Film & Media Institute, aren\u2019t considered an Oscar bellwether. But the black-tie affair, held at Cipriani Wall Street in downtown Manhattan, is known for celebrating smaller films while also dishing out generous helpings of tribute awards to Oscar hopefuls.",
      "That made \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a studio release that cost at least $130 million to make, unlike any previous winner at the Gothams.

      "But in 2023, the Gotham Awards dispensed with their $35 million budget cap for films. And this year, \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d a father-daughter tale of multigenerational protest, is widely seen as the best-picture front-runner and the movie to beat at March\u2019s Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this, actually,\u201d said Anderson, accepting the award. \u201cI started to think I didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d",

      "While the Gothams help the industry get into the swing of awards season, they're quirkier than bigger-name ceremonies. Small juries select nominees and winners, which often leads to unexpected results. Both of the acting winners on Monday weren\u2019t even in attendance.",
      "Best lead performance went to Sop\u00e9 D\u00ecr\u00eds\u00f9 for the British-Nigerian drama \u201cMy Father\u2019s Shadow.\u201d His award was accepted by the film\u2019s director, Akinola Davies Jr., who also won for breakthrough director.

      "Claire\u2019s grown kids (Felicity Jones, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Dominic Sessa ) don\u2019t appreciate her efforts. Her husband (Denis Leary) is supportive without being helpful. And she is operating as a one woman show, managing this precious time with her family and trying to keep it all cozy and happy and fun through constant, thankless labor (cooking, cleaning, wrapping, planning). She even looks fabulous on her many, many (too many?) garbage runs. But after one particularly cruel oversight from her family, she takes off from her suburban prison and doesn\u2019t tell anyone. For once, she\u2019s decided to go do something for herself.",

Fun\u201d is a movie that does very little with its setup and terrific cast (including the likes of Danielle Brooks, Joan Chen, Maude Apatow, Rose Abdoo and Eva Longoria in almost cameo-sized roles) opting instead for the most generic version of itself.",
      "The movie, streaming Wednesday on Prime Video, begins with a kind of \u201clow point\u201d (for a beautiful, well-off, stay-at-home Texas mom, that is) in which she tells some children in a neighboring car at a gas station to be nicer to their exhausted mother in the front seat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be dead someday,\u201d she says calmly and seriously. She wishes the mother a Merry Christmas, gives the kids a piercing look and then we get the dreaded freeze-frame/record scratch and a voiceover about being entitled to a little outburst around the holidays and a half-hearted rant about how many holiday movies are about men. Already this movie is making this poor woman apologize.",
      "\u201cThey need to make a movie about the true heroes of the holidays: Moms,\u201d Claire says. Sure, yes, preach Claire, even if her exclusions are suspect and her examples need further review. I\u2019m pretty sure \u201cHome Alone\u201d was at least a little bit about the mom, and that \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles\u201d doesn\u2019t deserve the vitriol. Alas, noble intentions aside, \u201cOh. What. Fun.\u201d probably wasn\u2019t what she had in mind.",
      "Director Michael Showalter co-wrote the script with the short story\u2019s author, Chandler Baker and is committed to keeping the proceedings light and breezy (no cancer diagnoses here). But the effect is a movie that seems almost embarrassed to commit to its own silly premise, rushing through everything instead of letting us enjoy this cast. Everyone gets assigned one tidy problem or flaw and no one has any sort of lived-in familial chemistry with one another.",
      "Channing (Jones) is the oldest and is married to Doug (Jason Schwartzman) who really wants her younger sister Taylor (Moretz) to think he\u2019s cool although Taylor, a serial monogamist who always brings a new woman home for the holidays, is just mean to him. Sessa is the youngest: Underemployed and recently dumped. There are two grandchildren too, Channing and Doug\u2019s twins, but they\u2019re nonentities.",

    "story": [
      "An AI-generated country song, \u201cWalk My Walk,\u201d recently topped Billboard's country digital song sales chart",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When an AI-generated country song called \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d hit No. 1 on Billboard's country digital song sales chart this month, it was credited to a fictional artist named Breaking Rust \u2014 a white, digitally generated avatar that didn't exist two months ago.",
      "But the song's vocal phrasing, melodic shape and stylistic DNA came from someone who does exist: Grammy-nominated country artist Blanco Brown, a Black music artist who has worked with Britney Spears, Childish Gambino and Rihanna.",
      "And he had no idea.",
      "\u201cI didn't even know about the song until people hit me up about it,\u201d said Brown, whose 2019 country rap hit \u201cThe Git Up\u201d helped usher in a new, hybrid era of country crossover. He didn't learn about the chart-topping AI track until his phone was flooded with messages from friends.",
      "\u201cMy phone just kept blowing up,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said: 'Man, somebody done typed your name in the AI and made a white version of you. They just used the Blanco, not the Brown.\u201d",
      "The moment is the latest example of how generative AI is upending the music industry, giving anyone the ability to instantly create seemingly new songs by typing prompts into a chat window, often using models trained on real artists' voices and styles without their knowledge.",
      "The credits for the grit-filled, chant-heavy track \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d list Aubierre Rivaldo Taylor as one of the song's creators, with streaming platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify identifying him as both the songwriter and producer. In recent months, Taylor has also been credited on streaming platforms as the songwriter and producer behind Defbeatsai \u2014 one of several X-rated, AI-generated country artists that exploded across social media last year.",
      "The Defbeatsai ecosystem, however, connects back to another figure in Brown's past: Abraham Abushmais, a collaborator Brown once jokingly called \u201cAbe Einstein\u201d for his sharp studio instincts. Abushmais co-wrote a couple of songs on Brown's 2019 album \u201cHoneysuckle & Lightning Bugs\u201d and is listed as the developer of Echo, an obscure AI-powered music generator app promoted on one of Defbeats.ai's Instagram pages with a link encouraging users to \u201cmake your own hit country song.\u201d",
      "Brown said he wasn't notified about their involvement in the AI hit, and the collaborator he once mentored has since become unreachable.",
      "\u201cAbe\u2019s number changed,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe used to talk. I ain\u2019t heard from him in a year or two.\u201d",
      "The AP reached out to Abushmais for comment but did not receive a response.",
      "The digital avatar fronting \u201cWalk My Walk,\" a white, AI-generated country singer built with a vocal approach modeled on Brown's sound, is where the moment shifted from eerie to uncomfortable.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a white AI man with a Black voice,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s singing like a Negro spiritual.\u201d",
      "For Brown, the shock quickly gave way to action. He went into the studio and recorded his cover of the song, which was released last week. He's also putting out a reworked derivative of the track on Monday with new lyrics and a new arrangement.",
      "Brown's management said his response to the song is a direct challenge to the legal, ethical and policy void surrounding AI-generated music. He wants to use his own lived experience to force the industry and lawmakers to confront who owns art and what happens when technology outpaces the rights of the human creators it imitates.",
      "\u201cIf someone is going to sing like me, it should be me,\u201d he said.",
      "For musicians and educators, the success of \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d made one thing clear: AI-generated music has leapt from internet experiment to commercial disruptor.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a very strange and unprecedented period of both creation and industry,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of the Ohio University Music Industry Summit. \u201cAI has essentially democratized the act of music creation itself.\u201d",

      "For Brown, this situation is a legal and cultural issue.",
      "He spent years navigating country music as a Black artist who blends gospel, hip-hop, pop and twang. He's been nominated for a Grammy and embraced by the Recording Academy, but country radio hasn't given him consistent traction.",
      "Meanwhile, an AI song built on his vocal identity and paired with a white avatar went straight to No. 1, a dynamic he says reflects a familiar pattern in Nashville: innovation from Black artists being reattributed.",
      "\u201cHe created something with my tone and gave it a white face,\u201d Brown said. \u201c(Race) is an understatement in Nashville.\u201d",
      "Music educators say the issue goes beyond authorship. While AI tools can convincingly approximate sound, they aren\u2019t able to capture the source of it.",
      "\u201cThere are things a real artist conveys that the digital part never will,\u201d said Shelton \u201cShelly\u201d Berg, dean of the University of Miami's Frost School of Music and a Grammy-nominated pianist. He spoke shortly after appearing on on a Future of Music panel at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles last week. \u201cThey occupy fundamentally different spaces.\u201d",
      "Berg said AI tracks can sometimes be polished in an eerie manner, but the intangible elements of performance remain out of reach.",
      "\u201cThere's an energy between an artist and an audience that happens in real time that you can't see but you can feel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are so many light years away from that happening in an AI environment.\u201d",
      "Brown insists he's not anti-AI. He's not even angry with Abushmais. He's proud that his sound inspired someone, but he understands what the moment exposes.",
      "For him, the arrival of an AI artist built on his tone only underscored something he has learned repeatedly in Nashville: talent is one thing, but how the industry assigns value is often something else.",
      "\u201cI go through this every day with real people who steal and borrow from what I do,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSo I don't care if it's a robot or a human. They're not giving me credit anyway.\u201d",
      "In a fast-changing landscape, Brown said artists will have one final advantage that machines can't mimic.",
      "\u201cReal artists are always going to prevail,\u201d he said. \u201cPurpose lives where greed can't.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.",
      "The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases.",
      "It's not immediately clear what witnesses or evidence are expected Thursday.",
      "Tuesday's court session displayed police body-camera video of officers confronting Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and concluding \u2014 to their amazement \u2014 that he was the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing five days earlier.",
      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

Still, they patted Mangione down and pushed his backpack away from him. About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they'd determined was a fake name.",
      "After he gave his real one, he was read his rights, handcuffed, frisked again and ultimately arrested on a forgery charge related to his fake ID.",
      "The video also provided glimpses of officers searching his backpack, a matter that will likely be explored further as the hearing goes on.",
      "Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. The defense contends the backpack items should be excluded because police didn\u2019t get a warrant before searching his bag.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.",

      "Federal health recommendations now suggest that all babies be vaccinated against the liver infection in their first day of life, but U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s committee on Thursday is expected to change that \u2014 contradicting previous public health advice.",

      "Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection that for most people lasts less than six months. But for some \u2014 especially infants and children \u2014 it can become a long-lasting problem that can lead to liver failure, liver cancer and scarring called cirrhosis.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use.",
      "But it can also be passed from an infected mother to a baby. As many as 90% of infants who contract hepatitis B go on to have chronic infections, meaning their immune systems don't completely clear the virus.",
      "As many as 2.4 million people in the U.S. are estimated to have hepatitis B, and as many as half are unaware they are infected, according to information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Baruch Blumberg, a federal scientist, identified the virus behind the infection in 1965. He won the Nobel Prize for the discovery, which led to tests and vaccines. The first hepatitis B vaccine was licensed in the U.S. in 1981.",
      "For decades, the nation's vaccine guidance has been influenced by a government-appointed panel of experts, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Its recommendations have usually been adopted as national guidance that is widely heeded by doctors.",
      "In 1991, the committee recommended an initial dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth. The guidance was modified a little over the years and currently suggests a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms), plus follow-up shots to be given at about 1 month and 6 months.",
      "Why a dose right at birth? Health officials used to rely on screening expectant mothers to find babies that might have been exposed to the virus. But many cases were missed, experts say, because some women weren't tested or test results were incorrect. Also, the virus can live on surfaces for more than seven days at room temperature, so unvaccinated children living with a person with a chronic infection can catch it.",
      "Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are widely considered to be a public health success story. Over about 30 years, cases among children fell from about 18,000 per year to about 2,200.",
      "A collaboration of public health researchers, the Vaccine Integrity Project, this week released its analysis of more than 400 studies and reports spanning 40 years. The group concluded the birth dose is safe, and is an important reason U.S. pediatric hepatitis B infections have fallen.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired all 17 members of ACIP earlier this year and replaced them with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices.",

Federal officials have not answered questions about exactly how much of a delay is being proposed, or disclosed what research is being used as a basis for such a decision.",
      "Not knowing what the committee is contemplating makes it difficult to guess the potential impact. But some have tried.",
      "This week, public health researchers collaborating with hepatitis-focused advocacy organizations released a report estimating that delaying the birth dose to 2 months could result in at least 1,400 hepatitis B infections in children and 480 deaths. The report \u2014 which has yet to be peer reviewed or published in a medical journal \u2014 estimated the toll would be higher if the first dose was given even later.",
      "But an ACIP change to the recommendation may have limited impact, O'Leary said.",
      "The committee's most direct power comes over what's covered by the government Vaccines for Children program, which pays for shots for uninsured children from low-income families. Hepatitis B shots often have been bundled into the final hospital bill for childbirth. So a new ACIP recommendation likely would not be an economic obstacle for the current practice continuing at many hospitals, he said.",

Then six months later, half of the girls got a second dose of their assigned vaccine \u2014 while the rest instead received an unrelated child vaccination.",
      "They all were tracked for five years, receiving regular cervical tests for the most cancer-prone HPV strains. Infection rates were compared to a separate unvaccinated group.",
      "A single HPV shot provided about 97% protection, similar to two doses, concluded researchers from the NCI and Costa Rica\u2019s Agency for Biomedical Research. The findings were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.",

      "The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday issued a stay in last week's ruling by Raleigh County Circuit Judge Michael Froble in a class-action lawsuit. In issuing an injunction, Froble said children of families who objected to the state\u2019s compulsory vaccination law on religious grounds would be allowed to attend school and participate in extracurricular sports.",

      "The board had suspended the vaccine mandate last week after Froble's ruling, which said that a state policy barring parents from seeking religious exemptions violated the Equal Protection for Religion Act signed into law in 2023 by then-Republican Gov. Jim Justice.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov.

Two groups had sued over the executive order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has replaced the head of his controversial vaccine advisory committee",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial vaccine advisory committee will be meeting later this week under a new chairperson, federal officials announced Monday.",
      "Martin Kulldorff is leaving the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to take a leadership role within the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.",
      "Dr. Kirk Milhoan, who has blamed vaccines for causing cardiovascular disease, will become the new chair. He had been appointed to the committee in September.",
      "Later this week, the committee is scheduled to discuss the pediatric vaccine schedule and hepatitis B shots given to newborns.",
      "HHS officials issued a press release praising Kulldorff and his work while leading the panel but did not answer additional questions about the changes. Kulldorff did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "The committee makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors almost always adopted the committee's recommendations, which were widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official, fired the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and replaced it with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. He also named Kulldorff as chairman.",
      "Under Kulldorff's leadership, the group made several decisions that angered major medical groups.",
      "At a June meeting, the panel recommended that a preservative called thimerosal be removed from doses of flu vaccine even though some members acknowledged there was no proof it was causing harm.",
      "In September, the group recommended new restrictions on a combination shot that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. The panel also took the unprecedented step of not recommending COVID-19 vaccinations \u2014 not even for high-risk populations like seniors \u2014 instead making it a matter of personal choice.",
      "Several doctors\u2019 groups said the changes were not based on good evidence, and advised doctors and patients to follow guidance that was previously in place.",
      "Kulldorff's departure leaves the vaccine committee with 11 members.",
      "It will now be led by Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional hearing at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.",
      "Kulldorff is a Swedish-born biostatistician who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "During his time as ACIP chair, the committee abandoned its traditional \"evidence-to-recommendation\" framework, which involved many months of analysis and discussion before proposals came before the full committee for a vote.",
      "In his new role, Kulldorff will become chief science officer within the HHS planning and evaluation office. Officials described the office as the department's \u201cin-house think tank.\u201d",

      "But it's unclear exactly what the committee plans to vote on. HHS officials have not responded to repeated questions seeking details.",
      "The current recommendations call for a first dose to be given to newborns within 24 hours of birth.",
      "Last week, 15 state governors submitted public comments suggesting the committee was hurting public trust in vaccines and the ability of people to get affordable shots.",
      "In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles while injecting drugs. But the virus can also be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections that can lead to a lifetime of health issues.",
      "A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).",
      "The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.",
      "The vaccinations are considered a success, and experts say no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life.",
      "But in September, Kennedy\u2019s ACIP members discussed whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do. The panel pulled back from taking a vote amid criticism from independent pediatric and infectious disease specialists who say the vaccine is safe and has helped infant infections drop sharply.",

      "Myopia, commonly called nearsightedness, is when people can clearly see objects at close range but struggle with distant objects, which often appear blurry or indistinct.",

      "The specialized glasses, sold under the brand Essilor Stellest, are approved by the FDA to slow nearsightedness in 6- to 12-year-olds.",
      "The FDA said it cleared the lenses based on company data showing children experienced a 70% reduction in the progression of their myopia after two years.",
      "Over time, myopia causes the eye to grow longer, worsening vision and increasing the risk of tears to the retina \u2014 the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that is essential for vision.",
      "The new lenses use 11 concentric rings filled with tiny raised dots to refocus light onto the retina in a way that is believed to slow elongation of the eye.",
      "\u201cWhether this hypothesis is ultimately proven to be true, of course, matters only in part,\u201d Repka said, noting that the lenses appear to work regardless of how the underling science works.",
      "In the company study, children wearing the lens showed a 50% reduction in eye lengthening when measured after two years. Currently, researchers in the U.S. and other countries are conducting their own independent studies to confirm those results.",

      "APATZINGAN, Mexico -- On a steamy night, a farmer from a village of modest tin-roofed homes surrounded by rolling lime orchards in western Mexico\u2019s coastal mountains approached Rev. Gilberto Vergara for help.",
      "The drug cartels were extorting him and other growers so heavily that the math no longer worked to harvest all his limes, the burly farmer told him tearfully after Mass. Authorities did nothing, he lamented. Residents were afraid speaking up was a death sentence but staying silent meant starving.",
      "Two recent killings \u2014 one of an outspoken representative of the lime growers, the other a popular mayor standing up to the cartels \u2014 have made a long-known truth impossible to ignore: Organized crime controls much of Michoacan and its economy.",
      "Now as U.S. President Donald Trump has launched military attacks against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific and has offered to send the U.S. military to Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum faces increased pressure to solve a puzzle no other leader has been able to. But years of failed tactics have left residents skeptical that the government will offer a solution.",
      "The priest did not expect much from authorities, but told the farmer he would try to speak to them.",
      "Later, Vergara still in his white cassock, drove home into the darkness of Tierra Caliente along cartel-controlled roads with the risk of land mines planted in the hills or drone attacks.",
      "The cartels \u201chave the state in their hands,\u201d the priest said.",

      "The criminals' message was clear: We can get anyone.",
      "Weeks later, the crime scene remained blocked off. Candles and wilted marigolds sat inside. Hundreds of handwritten messages demanding justice hung outside.",
      "Manzo, a former congressman for Sheinbaum\u2019s Morena party turned critic, was seen throughout Michoacan as the only politician trying to eradicate the drug cartels. He had run corrupt cops off the local police force, touted arrests of narcos on social platforms and earned a reputation for going into the most dangerous corners to talk to anyone. In October, he appealed to the federal government for help.",
      "\u201cIt felt like he was fighting for us,\u201d said Imelda Pe\u00f1a, a 42-year-old teacher, who criticized Sheinbaum for her perceived weakness on organized crime, although the president strengthened the federal security strategy when she came to power. \u201cI hope this is a tipping point.\u201d",
      "Uruapan residents called Manzo \u201cthe Mexican Bukele\u201d after El Salvador\u2019s millennial president with a no-holds-barred approach to his country\u2019s street gangs. Some saw Manzo as a potential gubernatorial candidate who could pry Michoacan back from Morena with his own political movement, but his message confronting the cartels resonated nationwide.",
      "Investigators have linked his killing to the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, but who ordered it and why remains unclear. The gunman was shot when he was already on the ground. Seven of the nine charged so far in case were Manzo's bodyguards.",

His brother Hip\u00f3lito Mora, founder of farmer self-defense groups more than a decade earlier, was killed two years ago.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we made the government and organized crime uncomfortable, that\u2019s why they\u2019re killing us,\u201d Guadalupe Mora said.",
      "Michoacan has stymied presidents before and has become one of Sheinbaum's biggest challenges. All strategies to pacify the state over the last 20 years have failed while criminal groups have multiplied and renewed their tactics.",

      "TOKYO -- The pledge by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to \u201cwork, work, work, work and work\u201d for her country has been named the catchphrase of the year, recognizing the effort Japan's first female leader had to make to reach the top.",
      "The ultraconservative Takaichi uttered the phrase in October when she was elected as head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Many were initially as worried about her work ethic as supportive of her enthusiasm.",
      "In a country notorious for long working hours, especially for working women who are also burdened with homemaking and caregiving, overwork is a sensitive topic. The recognition triggered a mixed reaction, with some interpreting it as satire.",
      "Accepting her award from a private committee this week, Takaichi said she only wanted to stress her enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cI have no intention of encouraging other people to overwork, or suggesting long working hours as a virtue,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI hope there is no misunderstanding.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, within weeks of taking office in late October, sparked a deepening spat with Beijing over her remark about possible Japanese military action in the event that China attacks Taiwan.",
      "As the nation's first female prime minister, Takaichi has captured public attention for her workwear, with women scrambling to copy her style, and the interest has not worn off.",
      "But while her dress sense has won admiration from younger women who say they are \u201cSana-katsu,\u201d or rooting for Sanae, it is unclear if her hard-line conservative policies will win the same praise.",
      "Takaichi is looking to regain right-wing supporters after the LDP\u2019s big election losses under her moderate predecessor Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "During her speech to party members Oct. 4 she promised an all-out effort to rebuild the struggling party and regain public support, urging lawmakers to \u201cwork like a horse.\u201d Then she added: \u201cI will abandon the idea of a \u2018work-life balance\u2019 \u2014 I will work, work, work, work and work.\u201d",
      "Repeating the word \u201cwork\u201d in a low, determined voice left a strong impression at the time.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s apparent long working hours and lack of sleep have worried fellow lawmakers. She held a meeting with aides at 3 a.m. before the first day of parliament Nov. 7, though she hasn\u2019t started that early since.",
      "\u201cI sleep about two hours now, four hours at the longest,\u201d Takaichi, who also provides care for her husband who is recovering from a stroke, told MPs at a budget committee meeting last month. \u201cIt\u2019s probably bad for my skin.\u201d",
      "She says she likes to soak in a hot tub in the morning and at night to relax. \u201dThat\u2019s my blissful time,\u201d she said.",
      "Her style-icon status has been boosted by her black bag, dubbed a \u201cSanae Bag,\" which is officially called the Grace Delight Tote. It is made by Hamano Inc., a 145-year old bagmaker based in Tokyo.",
      "Priced at 136,400 yen ($875), the simple leather bag is just large enough to fit A4-sized papers. It is selling the best since its debut 30 years ago, according to the company.",

      "Within days, inquiries and orders for the bag surged, and all eight colors have sold out. The bag, which is carefully made of high quality leather, cannot be mass-produced, and those who ordered it now have to wait until August, Kobayashi says.",
      "Another popular item is a sparkly light-pink pen Takaichi uses to take notes; it's Mitsubishi Pencil Co.\u2019s Jetstream 4&1.",
      "The pen, the \"Sanae Takaichi model,\u201d is often out of stock at stores and internet shopping sites. Those who have found one often proudly post photos with a message: \u201cMatching Sanae.\u201d",
      "The attention Takaichi is receiving is usually reserved for pop stars, athletes and influencers in Japan who fans have access to only through television or the internet.",
      "The prime minister's fans show their loyalty by buying the same bag and pen she uses, just as fans of star athletes like Shohei Ohtani buy replicas of his uniform to cheer on the Dodgers, experts say.",
      "Takaichi has won admiration as a new type of role model for women who have not usually rooted for prime ministers in the past, says Namiko Kubo-Kawai, a psychology professor at Nagoya Shukutoku University.",
      "In Japan, many female role models typically were supported for their femininity, but Takaichi is unique as a high-powered politician. Her short haircut and no-frills workwear also stand out from conventional female models.",
      "She may not inspire many feminists, however. Takaichi is a staunch conservative who champions Japan\u2019s traditional gender and paternalistic values. She has supported keeping the succession of Japan\u2019s monarchy male only. She also opposes changing a 19th-century law that would allow married couples the option of keeping separate surnames.",
      "Sill, as the first female prime minister, \u201cshe fits perfectly as a stylish role model and has won admiration from many women who have been looking for one even though they probably have never thought of rooting for a prime minister,\" Kubo-Kawai said. \u201cFemale role models are becoming more diverse.\"",

      "American zoologist Laurie Marker has been collecting and storing specimens in a cheetah sperm bank in Namibia for 35 years, hoping conservationists never have to use them",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- For 35 years, American zoologist Laurie Marker has been collecting and storing specimens in a cheetah sperm bank in Namibia, hoping conservationists never have to use them.",
      "But she worries that the world's fastest land animal might be on the brink of extinction one day and need artificial reproduction to save it.",
      "Marker says the sperm bank at the Cheetah Conservation Fund she founded in the southern African nation is a \u201cfrozen zoo\u201d of cheetahs she's been building since 1990. It would be utilized in a worst-case scenario for the big cats, whose numbers have dropped alarmingly in the wild over the last 50 years.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t do anything with it unless until it\u2019s needed,\u201d Marker, one of the foremost experts on cheetahs, told The Associated Press from her research center near the Namibian city of Otjiwarongo. \u201cAnd we never want to get to that point.\u201d",
      "Conservationists mark World Cheetah Day on Thursday with less than 7,000 of them left in the wild, similar numbers to the critically endangered black rhino. There are only around 33 populations of cheetahs spread out in pockets mainly across Africa, with most of those populations having less than 100 animals, Marker said.",
      "Like so many species, the sleek cats that can run at speeds of 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour) are in danger from habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict and the illegal animal trade. Their shrinking, isolated groups mean their gene pool is shrinking also as small populations continuously breed among themselves, with repercussions for their reproduction rates.",
      "Globally, cheetah numbers in the wild have dropped by 80% in the last half-century and they\u2019ve been pushed out of 90% of their historical range.",
      "Scientists believe that cheetahs already narrowly escaped extinction at the end of the last ice age around 10,000-12,000 years ago, which first reduced their gene pool.",
      "Marker said the lack of genetic diversity, along with the fact that cheetahs have 70-80% abnormal sperm, mean they might need help in the future.",
      "\u201cAnd so, a sperm bank makes perfect sense, right?\u201d Marker said.",
      "Storing sperm is not unique to cheetahs in the wildlife world. It's a tactic that conservationists have developed for other species, including elephants, rhinos, antelopes, other big cats, birds and others.",
      "The value of animal reproductive research, Marker said, is seen in the desperate battle to save the northern white rhino from extinction.",

      "Because both remaining northern white rhinos \u2014 a mother and daughter \u2014 can't carry pregnancies, scientists have tried to implant northern white rhino embryos in southern white rhino surrogates. The surrogates haven't managed to carry any of the pregnancies to term, but the conservation team has committed to keep trying to save northern white rhinos against all odds.",
      "Other efforts around artificial reproduction have been successful, including a project that bred black-footed ferrets using artificial reproduction after they'd been reduced to a single wild population in Wyoming in the United States.",
      "Marker doesn't chase down cheetahs to collect their sperm but takes samples opportunistically. In Namibia, cheetahs are mostly in danger from farmers who view them as threats to their livestock, meaning Marker's team are called out for cats that have been injured or captured and will collect samples while treating and releasing them.",
      "Sperm samples can also be taken from dead cheetahs. \u201cEvery cheetah is actually a unique mix of a very small number of genes. We will try to bank every animal we possibly can,\" Marker said.",
      "The samples from approximately 400 cheetahs and counting are now stored at ultralow temperatures in liquid nitrogen at the Cheetah Conservation Fund laboratory. Marker's research does not involve any artificial insemination as breeding wild animals in captivity is not allowed in Namibia.",
      "Should cheetahs be threatened with extinction again, the first backup would be the roughly 1,800 cats living in zoos and other captive environments. But, Marker said, cheetahs don't breed well in captivity and the sperm bank might be, like the northern white rhinos, the last resort.",

      "A second Vatican study commission has determined that women should not be ordained as deacons",
      "ROME -- A second Vatican study commission has determined that women should not be ordained as deacons, dealing another setback to Catholic women who hope one day to be able to preside at weddings, baptisms and funerals.",
      "The Vatican on Thursday took the unusual step of publishing a synthesis of the commission\u2019s findings, including the members' votes on specific theological questions. The report left open the possibility of further study but proposed instead the creation of new lay ministries for women outside the ordained diaconate.",
      "Deacons are ordained ministers who perform many of the same functions as priests, presiding at weddings, baptisms and funerals. They can preach but cannot celebrate Mass.",
      "For male seminarians, the diaconate is a transitional ministry on their way to being ordained as priests. Married men can also be ordained as permanent deacons. Women cannot, although historians say women served as deacons in the early Christian church.",
      "Pope Francis in 2016 ordered a first study commission on the issue following a request from the umbrella organization of the world\u2019s female religious orders, the International Union of Superiors General. After that commission apparently failed to reach consensus, Francis created a second study commission in 2020, named for its president, president Cardinal Giuseppe Petrocchi, which released its report Thursday.",
      "Petrocchi concluded that there are two currently irreconcilable schools of theological thought on the question, requiring the Vatican to take a prudential approach. One school of thought would allow for a female diaconate, while the other would not.",
      "Given the impasse, the current state of research \u201crules out the possibility of moving in the direction of admitting women to the diaconate understood as a degree of the sacrament of Holy Orders\u201d the report said. But it left open the possibility for further study, saying the current state of investigation doesn\u2019t allow for a \u201cdefinitive judgment to be formulated.\u201d",
      "Catholic women do much of the church\u2019s work in schools and hospitals and are usually responsible for passing the faith to the next generation. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. They have pressed for greater roles in both decision-making management jobs and ministerial vocations.",
      "Advocates for expanding the diaconate to include women say doing so would provide women with greater role in the ministry and governance of the church, while also helping address the effects of the Catholic priest shortage in parts of the world by allowing women to perform some priestly functions.",
      "Opponents say ordaining women to the deaconate would signal the start of a slippery slope toward ordaining women to the priesthood. The Catholic Church reserves the priesthood for men, saying Christ chose only men as his 12 Apostles.",
      "Francis had been comfortable allowing debate on the issue while punting any definitive decision. The female diaconate was discussed during his 2019 Amazon synod, or meeting of bishops, and again during Francis\u2019 bigger yearslong reform synod, which in 2024 called for the question to remain open.",

Petrocchi noted that the issue was only relevant in a few countries and only 22 submissions had been received, saying that was hardly representative of the global church.",
      "Pope Leo XIV ordered Petrocchi's synthesis report released, and that could suggest that for him the issue is now closed.",
      "The former Cardinal Robert Prevost has said previously that women cannot be ordained as priests, and has seemed noncommittal on whether women could ever serve as deacons.",
      "During a 2023 press conference, Prevost acknowledged that Francis had created the two study commissions but he warned that turning women into clerics \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily solve a problem, it might make a new problem.\u201d",
      "Phyllis Zagano, a researcher at Hofstra University in New York and a member of the 2016 commission, complained that the document issued Thursday \u201cdoes its best to present the topic in a negative light\u201d by arguing that \u201csince women are barred from priestly ordination, they may not be ordained as deacons.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe long report does not present evidence or a theological argument, only the opinion that more study is needed. In short, they cannot say \u2018no,\u2019 they simply do not want to say \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "BANGKOK -- An election candidate in the strife-torn nation of Myanmar has been detained by a resistance group opposed to army rule, state media reported Wednesday, the first known such action before the polls scheduled for later this month.",
      "The detention of Wai Lin Htet, 37, a candidate of the Shan and Nationalities Democratic Party, highlights ongoing tensions in Myanmar, where local resistance groups clash with the military government as it tries to hold the Dec. 28 election.",
      "The Magway region has been one of the strongholds of armed resistance since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, forming the People\u2019s Defense Force, which is now engaged in combat in many areas of the country.",
      "Critics have denounced the election plan as a sham to normalize the military takeover, and several opposition organizations, including armed resistance groups, have said they will try to derail them.",
      "Jeremy Laurence, a spokesperson for the U.N.\u2019s human rights office, warned last Friday that the ballot would be conducted in an environment \u201crife with threats and violence\u201d and actively suppressed political participation.",
      "A report in the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper said that Wai Lin Htet was detained at 3 p.m. on Saturday by three members of a local resistance group who arrived on two motorbikes, while he was at home with his family in Pakokku Township, in central Myanmar\u2019s Magway Region.",

      "The report said that authorities were seeking the arrest of the three under a section of a new electoral law that carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison for detaining a parliamentary candidate and preventing him from conducting election activities.",
      "According to reports from local media, including the online news site Myanmar Now, nearly 100 people, including film directors, have been arrested under the election law since it was enacted in July, and some of them have received sentences of up to 49 years in prison.",
      "Sai Ai Pao, chairman of the Shan and Nationalities Democratic Party \u2014 also known as the White Tiger Party, and one of six parties contesting the polls nationwide \u2014 refused to comment to The Associated Pres about the incident because of concerns about the candidate\u2019s safety.",
      "The Shan and Nationalities Democratic Party, once a small ethnic party based in Shan and Kachin states in previous elections, is now competing nationwide with more than 580 candidates, making it the fifth-largest of the six parties competing nationwide. It's not considered explicitly pro- or anti-military, but its participation in the election gives the impression it is allied with the army.",

      "Front Row Motorsports owner Bob Jenkins has testified in an antitrust case against NASCAR, accusing it of monopolistic practices",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Front Row Motorsports owner Bob Jenkins was back on the stand Thursday to testify on the fourth day of the explosive antitrust case that accuses NASCAR of being a monopolistic bully in violation of federal antitrust laws.",
      "Jenkins began his testimony Wednesday and the fast-food franchiser said he was a passionate NASCAR fan who fulfilled a longtime dream when he was finally able to own a car in the top motorsports series in the United States.",
      "But he said he has lost $100 million since becoming a team owner in the early 2000s and that's even with a 2001 victory in the Daytona 500. His love of the sport and belief that it can be profitable have kept him going, but what he believes is a no-win revenue model led Front Row to join 23XI Racing in a federal lawsuit against NASCAR.",
      "23XI is owned by Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin. Jordan has the funding to fight NASCAR and Jenkins joined the battle when he became offended by NASCAR's \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d offer on charter agreements.",
      "A charter is the equivalent of the franchise model used by other sports leagues, but in NASCAR it guarantees a team a spot in the field for all 38 races plus a designated percentage of revenue. Front Row was one of the teams that received two charters for free when NASCAR created the system in 2016 and Jenkins thought the agreements were lousy then \u2014 but a step in the right direction.",
      "All 15 Sprint Cup organizations fought for more than two years for better terms on the charter extensions that began this year. But when NASCAR's final offer was presented at 6 p.m. on a Friday last year with six hours to sign the 112-page document, Jenkins balked because it went \u201cvirtually backward in so many ways.",
      "\u201cIt was insulting, it went so far backward,\" he testified Wednesday. \"NASCAR wanted to run the governance with an iron fist, it was like taxation without representation. NASCAR has the right to do whatever it wants.\u201d",
      "He said he was \"honestly very hurt\u201d by the sequence of events and believed NASCAR \u201cknew we had to blindly sign it. Some of these owners have $500-$600 million facilities, long-term sponsors. They couldn\u2019t walk away from that.\u201d",
      "Jenkins testified that Joe Gibbs personally apologized to Jenkins for signing the deal, and most owners reluctantly signed the agreement.",
      "\u201cNot a single owner said, \u2018I was happy to sign it.\u2019 Not a single one,\u201d he testified. \u201c100% of the owners think the charter system is good,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThe charter agreement is not.\u201d",
      "Front Row and 23XI were the only two organizations out of 15 that refused to sign and instead went to court in a trial that could completely rework NASCAR's framework.",
      "The extensions ended more than two years of bitter negotiations in which neither NASCAR or the teams budged.",
      "NASCAR executive vice president in charge of strategy Scott Prime testified Wednesday that a study he worked on as a consultant found the longevity of the sport was in danger if NASCAR didn\u2019t act to improve the health of their race teams.",

The pretrial discovery process revealed NASCAR made more than $100 million in 2024.",
      "NASCAR contends it is doing nothing wrong and has not restrained trade or commerce by its teams. The series says the original charters were given for free to teams when the system was created in 2016 and the demand for them created a market of $1.5 billion in equity for chartered organizations.",
      "The new charter agreement upped the guaranteed money for every chartered car to $12.5 million in annual revenue, from $9 million. But Hamlin and Jenkins have both testified it costs $20 million to bring a single car to the track for all 38 races and that figure does not include any overhead, operating costs or a driver\u2019s salary.",
      "Both testified they don\u2019t have the ability to slash costs and teams are too reliant on outside sponsorship to survive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s offensive to say I\u2019ve overspent. We have a model that works for us,\u201d Jenkins testified. \u201cI have never turned a profit. And it\u2019s not from malpractice. The level we compete at is just so expensive.\u201d",
      "Prime testified as much and noted in his consulting role he discovered in 2014 that teams lost a combined $85 million, or an average of $1.3 million a car. He also learned that under the system before charters, when cars had to qualify for a race based on speed, a team would lose $700,000 if it failed to make the field.",

      "Traders in Tehran\u2019s Grand Bazaar say every new headline about United Nations \u201csnapback\u201d sanctions, the rial\u2019s fall or renewed regional tensions have sent waves of people into buying so-called \u201cvalue-preserving assets.\" Those include dollars, gold, silver, diamonds, cryptocurrencies and, to a lesser extent, equities.",

      "\u201cRight now, I see gold as the best way to preserve value,\u201d he said. \"Whenever I make money, I turn it into gold.\u201d",
      "Over the summer, 1-gram, 18-karat gold bars traded at around 115 million rials \u2014 about $100 as the rial now trades at over 1 million to $1. Gold coins were over $1,000 and 1-kilogram silver ingots were nearly $2,000. On Saturday, the price of a gold coin in Iran exceeded 1.2 billion rials for the first time in the country\u2019s history.

      "Reports of mass layoffs in Iran's economy, stemming from problems with electricity, consumer demand and sanctions, also have circulated for months. Amir Ramezani, a top gold trader in Tehran, said that some families from more well-to-do families have begun selling parts of their assets to cope.",
      "\u201cTheir incomes today don\u2019t match the lives they built,\u201d Ramezani said. \u201cTo sustain the same lifestyle, many are selling valuables \u2014 gold, jewelry \u2014 just to keep up.\u201d",

      "There's also another reason that Iranians remain reluctant to discuss \u2014 being able to have the money portable in case of another war. Tens of thousands of Iranians living in Tehran are believed to have fled the capital during the 12-day war, heading out into the countryside of Iran or north to the coast of the Caspian Sea.",

      "As a natural material, bamboo can be combustible, Crolla said. But \u201cwhen it is properly used and combined with certified fire-retardant netting it is comparatively hard to ignite.\u201d",
      "During the fire, flames shot up the bamboo scaffolding erected for external maintenance work,-as well as the green netting draping it. But bamboo is usually not \u201ceasily ignited,\" said Raffaella Endrizzi, an architect who researches bamboo scaffolding who teaches at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cFocusing on bamboo alone risks obscuring more systemic safety issues,\u201d she said.",
      "Last week, as firefighters battled the deadly inferno for a second day, the city\u2019s chief secretary for administration, Eric Chan, told reporters that bamboo scaffolding's fire resistance was \u201cinferior\u201d to that of metal scaffolding.",
      "The city's top leader, John Lee, said officials had met with construction industry representatives to discuss timelines for switching to metal scaffolding. Metal should be used for safety reasons when possible, Chan said.",
      "The initial cause of the fire is under investigation. So far, experts have found that some of the green netting wrapped around the bamboo scaffolding was substandard and that flammable foam boards were used to seal windows during the months' long renovations. Those were the main factors causing the fire to spread to seven of the eight buildings in the Wang Fuk Court complex, said Secretary for Security Chris Tang.",
      "One note in Chinese left among a mountain of bouquets placed near the disaster site stood out: \u201cit\u2019s not the bamboo scaffolding that should be reviewed, but the whole system.\" Many others have posted similar comments on social media.",
      "Putting the blame on bamboo scaffolding is a \u201clazy, scapegoating\u201d move that distracts from deeper issues, Regina Ip, a former Hong Kong secretary for security who is an adviser to the chief executive, Lee, wrote Tuesday in the local newspaper Ming Pao.",
      "\u201cIt would be a great pity to hastily decide on banning bamboo scaffolding -- which is flexible to use -- because of this incident,\u201d John Tsang, a former Hong Kong financial secretary, wrote on his Facebook page.",
      "\u201cAnyone with common sense knows that bamboo isn\u2019t so easy to burn,\u201d he said.",
      "Those defending bamboo scaffolding say it's uniquely suited to Hong Kong\u2019s dense, irregular urban landscape.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s light, fast, adaptable, and supported by generations of skilled scaffolders -- qualities that have shaped the city\u2019s skyline and construction pace,\u201d said Endrizzi, of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.",

      "As the territory mourns over the high-rise apartment fire that killed at least 151 people, anger and frustration are mounting over building safety lapses, suspected construction corruption and lax government oversight.",
      "But bigger issues are at play. Some political analysts and observers say the tragedy could be the \u201ctip of an iceberg\u201d in Hong Kong, a city whose skyline is built on high-rise buildings. Suspicions of bid-rigging and use of hazardous construction materials in renovation projects across other housing estates have left many worried the disaster could be repeated.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body have arrested 14 people so far in a wide-ranging probe into a multi-million dollar renovation project at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex, where the fire broke out on Wednesday. Those detained include scaffolding subcontractors, directors of a construction company and a consultancy, many of them on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence.",
      "\u201cThe question (one) should be asking, really is that, what happened at Wang Fuk Court, can it happen elsewhere?\u201d said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.",
      "Hong Kong officials initially said tests of green netting covering bamboo scaffolding at the housing complex in suburban Tai Po showed that it met fire safety codes, but highly flammable foam panels used to seal windows during the repairs, aided by strong winds, caused the blaze to spread swiftly between seven of the eight towers in the complex.",
      "But on Monday, Eric Chan, Hong Kong\u2019s chief secretary, said that seven of 20 additional samples collected later from the site failed to meet safety standards. Authorities said there was evidence contractors cut costs by using cheaper substandard netting along with standard materials to pad their profits, after a typhoon in July damaged some of the netting originally installed.",
      "Some fire alarms failed to sound when the fire broke out, residents and officials said.",
      "\u201cIt did open a Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d said John Burns, an honorary professor of politics and public administration at the University of Hong Kong (HKU).",

      "As a precaution, authorities suspended work on renovations at 28 other projects managed by the same construction company. With residents of high-rises worried, contractors were removing foam boards and netting used to cover scaffolding at other projects.",
      "The netting \u201cis not a one particular estate problem. It\u2019s a much wider general problem,\u201d said Tsang of SOAS.",
      "Government oversight also has come into question. Residents of Wang Fuk Court had been voicing safety concerns to the authorities about construction materials such as netting used in the renovations, according to documents reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The Labor Department said it reviewed netting's product quality certificate and found it \u201cin line\u201d with standards. It also said it had conducted 16 inspections at the complex since last year -- most recently about a week before the fire -- and had warned contractors repeatedly they had to ensure they met fire safety requirements.",

      "President Donald Trump has announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a proposal to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks.",
      "The plan, if finalized next year, would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements, which set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline, through the 2031 model year. The administration and automakers say the rules will increase Americans\u2019 access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration projects that the new standards would set the industry fleetwide average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon in the 2031 model year, down from a projected 50.4 miles per gallon in 2031 under the Biden-era rule.",
      "The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles, and it sparked criticism from environmental groups. Burning gasoline for vehicles is a major contributor to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "The rule reverses a Biden-era policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The action is expected to save consumers about $1,000 off the price of a new car, Trump said. New cars sold for an average of $49,766 on average in October, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Automakers applauded the planned changes, which came amid industry complaints that the Biden-era rules were difficult to meet.",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley said the planned rollback was \u201ca win for customers and common sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs America\u2019s largest auto producer, we appreciate President Trump\u2019s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities. We can make real progress on carbon emissions and energy efficiency while still giving customers choice and affordability,\u201d he said.",
      "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa said the automaker appreciates the administration\u2019s actions to \u201crealign\u201d the mileage standards \u201cwith real world market conditions.\u201d",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has relaxed auto tailpipe emissions rules, repealed fines for automakers that do not meet federal mileage standards and terminated consumer credits of up to $7,500 for EV purchases.",
      "Environmentalists decried the rollback.",
      "\u201cIn one stroke Trump is worsening three of our nation\u2019s most vexing problems: the thirst for oil, high gas pump costs and global warming,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the Center for Biological Diversity.",

The Biden administration also increased fuel-economy requirements by 2% each year for light-duty vehicles in every model year from 2027 to 2031, and 2% per year for SUVs and other light trucks from 2029 to 2031. At the same time, it called for stringent tailpipe rules meant to encourage EV adoption.",

      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into events like weddings and birthdays, some are growing their own bouquets or picking wildflowers straight from local fields",
      "Instead of hiring a florist for her October wedding, Emily Day decided to grow her own flowers in her front yard in Calgary, Canada \u2014 a creative challenge that turned into a lesson on the hidden climate costs of the global flower industry. She said her homegrown arrangements were just as beautiful as store-bought ones and cost a fraction of the price.",
      "Day and her fiance built garden boxes out of wooden shipping containers in March and filled them with blooms like yarrow, feverfew, strawflowers and statice. They harvested and dried them in midsummer ahead of fall frosts. On her wedding day, her bouquets featured autumn shades accented by blue echinops from a local farmer and tansy she foraged from roadside ditches.",
      "Because her flowers were dried, they\u2019ll last far longer than a typical wedding arrangement. In total, she spent about 1,300 Canadian dollars ($925), a fraction of what many couples pay florists. Day said growing her own flowers made her think more about the environmental costs behind imported blooms \u2014 from the plastic packaging they arrive in, to the fuel used to fly them across continents.",
      "As Generation Z and millennials incorporate sustainability into weddings and other special events, some are growing their own bouquets, picking wildflowers or using potted plants. Businesses are sourcing their flowers locally and collecting and repurposing flowers when the event\u2019s done.",
      "The path many imported fresh flowers take to North America often begins in South America and involves a supply chain full of carbon emissions, said Kai Chan, professor of sustainability science at the University of British Columbia.",
      "Flowers perish quickly when they are cut, so they are refrigerated and transported on planes, both of which require energy and release planet-warming gases. Growing massive fields of roses, or any other single plant, typically requires clearing trees and other natural vegetation. This practice, known as monoculture, harms the environment by depleting soil nutrients and making the area more vulnerable to pests.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of antithetical to the way that ecosystems work \u2026 you\u2019re fighting against nature at every turn,\u201d Chan said.",
      "He said buying flowers from local, small-scale farmers is generally favorable because the blooms don't travel as far and the farmers typically follow practices attuned to the local environment.",
      "Holly Lukasiewicz, who owns District 2 Florals in Omaha, Nebraska, incorporates sustainable practices such as sourcing locally and avoiding the green foam blocks that are used to anchor arrangements but typically aren't biodegradable. For an extra fee, she\u2019ll pick up the flowers and compost them. She also presses and preserves flowers for clients.",
      "\u201cWhen I started my business, I knew that I wanted to recycle everything that I could, compost what I could, repurpose what I could,\u201d Lukasiewicz said.",
      "Lukasiewicz hopes more clients will embrace seasonal and local selections rather than expecting any flower, any time of the year.",
      "For decades, much of the flower industry moved abroad because of trade policies and lower costs. Imported flowers are often cheaper, especially when customers want something that can't be grown locally.",

      "The Ministry of Communications on Monday asked smartphone makers to install the government\u2019s \u201cSanchar Saathi\u201d app within 90 days and to prevent users from disabling it. It also required manufacturers to push the app onto older models through a software update.",
      "Monday\u2019s directive led to widespread criticism and concerns of violation of data privacy and user consent in one of the largest handset markets in the world. That order also clashed with policies of companies like U.S.-based Apple, which prohibits preinstalling third-party apps on its devices, including those developed by governments.",
      "The ministry said in a statement Wednesday that 600,000 new users had registered to download the app in the last day. While noting its increased acceptance, it said the government \u201chas decided not to make the preinstallation mandatory for mobile manufacturers.\u201d",

      "Students applying to college know they're not supposed to use AI chatbots to write their essays",
      "Students applying to college know they can\u2019t \u2014 or at least shouldn\u2019t \u2014 use AI chatbots to write their essays and personal statements. So it might come as a surprise that some schools are now using artificial intelligence to read them.",
      "AI tools are now being incorporated into how student applications are screened and analyzed, admissions directors say. It can be a delicate topic, and not all colleges are eager to talk about it, but higher education is among the many industries where artificial intelligence is rapidly taking on tasks once reserved for humans.",
      "In some cases, schools are quietly slipping AI into their evaluation process, experts say. Others are touting the technology\u2019s potential to speed up their review of applications, cut processing times and even perform some tasks better than humans.",
      "\u201cHumans get tired; some days are better than others. The AI does not get tired. It doesn\u2019t get grumpy. It doesn\u2019t have a bad day. The AI is consistent,\u201d says Juan Espinoza, vice provost for enrollment management at Virginia Tech.",
      "This fall, Virginia Tech is debuting an AI-powered essay reader. The college expects it will be able to inform students of admissions decisions a month sooner than usual, in late January, because of the tool's help sorting tens of thousands of applications.",
      "Colleges stress they are not relying on AI to make admissions decisions, using it primarily to review transcripts and eliminate data-entry tasks. But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said. Students upload their research to an AI chatbot that interviews them about it on video, which is then reviewed by Caltech faculty.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gauge of authenticity. Can you claim this research intellectually? Is there a level of joy around your project? That passion is important to us,\u201d Pallie said.",
      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faced a barrage of negative feedback from applicants, parents and students after its student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, reported in January the school was using AI to evaluate the grammar and writing style of applicants' essays.",
      "The university declined to comment for this article and referred to its admissions website, which it updated after the criticism. \u201cUNC uses AI programs to provide data points about students\u2019 common application essay and their school transcripts,\u201d the website says. Every application \u201cis evaluated comprehensively by extensively trained human application evaluators.\u201d",
      "At Virginia Tech, Espinoza said he has been contacted by several colleges that are interested in the new technology but wary of backlash. \u201cThe feedback from a lot of colleagues is, \u2018You roll this out, we\u2019re watching you, and we\u2019ll see how everyone\u2019s reacting,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He stressed the AI reader his school spent three years developing is being used only to confirm human readers' essay scores.",
      "Until this fall, each of the four short-answer essays Virginia Tech applicants submit was read and scored by two people. Under the new system, one of those readers is the AI model, which has been trained on past applicant essays and the rubric for scoring, Espinoza said.",

      "The messaging is sensitive for colleges, many of which now have students certify that they have not used AI unethically for essays and other parts of the application. But schools say AI tools can help admissions offices eliminate errors in tasks like uploading transcripts and can simplify the process for students.",
      "Georgia Tech this fall is rolling out an AI tool to review the college transcripts of transfer students, replacing the need for staff to enter each course manually into a database. It will allow the school to inform applicants more quickly how many transfer credits they'll receive, cutting down on uncertainty and wait times, said Richard Clark, the school's executive director of enrollment management.",

Georgia Tech also is testing out AI tools for other uses, including one that would identify low-income students who are eligible for federal Pell Grants but may not have realized it.",

      "\u201cMaybe a student was fighting a disease sophomore year. Or maybe a parent passed away, or they\u2019re taking care of siblings at home. All these things matter, and it allows the counselors to look at the transcript differently,\u201d Beatty said.",
      "Colleges are interested in AI summaries of transcripts, extracurricular activities and letters of recommendation that tell human readers the students\u2019 story in a more digestible way, said Emily Pacheco, founder of NACAC\u2019s special interest group for AI and admission.",
      "\u201cHumans and AI working together \u2014 that is the key right now. Every step along the way can be greatly improved: transcript reading, essay reviews, telling us things we might be missing about the students,\u201d said Pacheco, a former assistant director of admission at Loyola University Chicago. \u201cTen years from now, all bets are off. I\u2019m guessing AI will be admitting students.\u201d",

      "Set yourself up for success as the year winds down",
      "As 2025 winds down, here are some moves to help you finish the year strong financially. Morningstar\u2019s director of personal finance and retirement planning, Christine Benz, discusses strategies.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Q: What are the benefits of portfolio rebalancing, and who most needs to do it?",
      "A: The main benefit of rebalancing is risk reduction. You trim securities that have performed really well, presumably ones with higher valuations today. And you redirect the money into securities where returns have lagged, but valuations might be more attractive. It\u2019s also important to rebalance on an ongoing basis as you get closer to your spending target.",
      "As retirement approaches, we need to spend that money, so you want to de-risk your portfolio and build safer asset reserves. Investors age 50 and above really need to take notice of rebalancing. It\u2019s time to take some winnings and build safer assets that you could access if you needed to spend from your portfolio. Moving money into high-quality bonds removes risk and takes advantage of current attractive yields.",
      "Q: What do you recommend for people who are still working and saving for retirement?",
      "A: They should rebalance as well, but their main consideration should be their U.S. versus non-U.S. exposure. Most investors are underallocated in international stocks. Consider your style diversification as well, paying attention to underperforming areas.",
      "Review your retirement contributions, to see if you can boost or even max out your company retirement plan for the year. People over 50 can make catch-up contributions, and there are special catch-up contributions this year for people between 60 and 63. You can contribute to IRAs and HSAs until the tax filing deadline.",
      "Q: How can people over 73 connect their RMDs with portfolio rebalancing?",
      "A: Required minimum distributions must be taken on time, but they can also help meet your rebalancing. By using appreciated securities to meet your RMD, you de-risk your portfolio, satisfy the IRS\u2019 obligations, and may free up assets to supply your cash flow needs for next year.",
      "Q: Is it also a good time to look at your insurance coverage?",
      "A: Whether you are doing open enrollment for employer-provided health care or for Medicare, it\u2019s important to shop around. Take stock of what has changed in your situation, and in the plans on offer. This is particularly important for employer-provided plans, which change frequently. Married couples often select whichever spouse\u2019s plan looks better and most affordable, but sometimes it\u2019s more cost-effective for each partner to be covered by their own company\u2019s plan.",
      "Q: How can charitable donations connect with RMDs and lessen your portfolio risk?",
      "A: Investors with highly appreciated holdings in taxable accounts should consider giving appreciated assets directly to charity or sending them to a donor-advised fund. You can disburse from the donor-advised fund to charities over multiple years. Donating removes a highly appreciated asset from your portfolio, which can lessen risk, and removes the tax liability associated with that holding. You won\u2019t owe taxes on donated funds, and you could get a tax deduction.",

      "San Francisco has filed a lawsuit against major food manufacturers like Coca-Cola and Nestle, claiming ultraprocessed foods are causing a public health crisis",
      "The city of San Francisco filed a lawsuit against some of the nation's top food manufacturers on Tuesday, arguing that ultraprocessed food from the likes of Coca-Cola and Nestle are responsible for a public health crisis.",
      "City Attorney David Chiu named 10 companies in the lawsuit, including the makers of such popular foods as Oreo cookies, Sour Patch Kids, Kit Kat, Cheerios and Lunchables. The lawsuit argues that ultraprocessed foods are linked to diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and cancer.",
      "\u201cThey took food and made it unrecognizable and harmful to the human body,\u201d Chiu said in a news release. \"These companies engineered a public health crisis, they profited handsomely, and now they need to take responsibility for the harm they have caused.\u201d",
      "Ultraprocessed foods include candy, chips, processed meats, sodas, energy drinks, breakfast cereals and other foods that are designed to \u201cstimulate cravings and encourage overconsumption,\u201d Chiu's office said in the release. Such foods are \u201cformulations of often chemically manipulated cheap ingredients with little if any whole food added,\u201d Chiu wrote in the lawsuit.",
      "The other companies named in the lawsuit are PepsiCo; Kraft Heinz Company; Post Holdings; Mondelez International; General Mills; Kellogg; Mars Incorporated; and ConAgra Brands.",
      "None of the companies named in the suit immediately responded to emailed requests for comment.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the negative impact of ultraprocessed foods and their links to chronic disease and has targeted them in his Make America Healthy Again campaign. Kennedy has pushed to ban such foods from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for low-income families.",

      "Everything the Trump administration has done this year to strengthen and enforce the standards for truck drivers and the schools that train them after several deadly crashes may cause problems for some companies if immigrants continue to flee the profe...",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s latest move to enforce standards for commercial truck drivers, by flagging nearly half of the driving schools as noncompliant, doesn\u2019t figure to disrupt the industry, experts say. But the heavy scrutiny on immigrant drivers might.",
      "The bigger, more reputable schools were not included in the list and many of the schools that were appear to have already been idle, leading trucking industry officials to predict minimal turmoil. The self-certification process that has been in place since 2022 allowed questionable schools to gain recognition. Plus, these efforts to enforce training standards \u2014 and the previous moves to strengthen licensing particularly for immigrants \u2014 will take effect gradually over time as licenses come up for renewal and new drivers graduate from schools.",
      "The fact that there are probably more drivers than needed right now in the midst of a 10% drop in shipments since 2022 because of the economic uncertainty also helps, although trucking companies still struggle to find enough well-qualified drivers with clean records.",
      "Even before a truck driver that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people, the administration focused on making sure truck drivers meet English proficiency standards. The focus on immigrant drivers, who account for about 20% of all truckers, intensified after that August crash as the Transportation Department audited commercial driver's license programs and Duffy proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus.",
      "A court put the new rules on hold. But Duffy threatened to withhold millions from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after the audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired, That pressure prompted California to revoke 17,000 licenses.",
      "Trucking company owner Dave Atwal said that as a result many of his drivers at Diamond Transportation in Lodi, California, are \u201cjust afraid to go to some of these other states where they might get harassed.\u201d Atwal has been able to assign some drivers to in-state routes, but he has lost more than 40 drivers who either walked away from the job or were unable to renew their licenses even though they have several years of safe driving on their records.",
      "Dave Laut said he has had a hard time finding all the drivers he wants to have behind the wheels of his 300 or so trucks at FBT Inc. Immigrant drivers are bearing the brunt of the government enforcement, according to Laut who is Sikh like the driver in the Florida crash and the driver of another fatal crash in California this fall.",
      "\u201cA lot of (Sikhs) are quitting truck driving,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel people target them, and they feel insulted and they are quitting jobs. They are hardworking guys. They stand out more.\u201d",
      "Laut said his company underwent a Homeland Security audit of his drivers' immigration statuses about two weeks ago. It passed that review, which many trucking firms in California are undergoing.",
      "But Duffy's announcement Monday that as many as 7,500 trucking programs could soon be decertified will threaten the ongoing effort to attract and train new drivers \u2014 particularly if any schools doing things the right way get caught up with schools not playing by the rules.",
      "But many of the schools that would be forced out of business were already idle before the Transportation Department took action, so decertifying them may not have a dramatic impact. The vast majority of the schools at risk either failed to submit a required biannual report or hadn't submitted any certificates verifying that a student had completed their course in the past year.",
      "Logan Cooper, who arranges for trucks to deliver containers of imported goods from ports and rail yards for OEC Group, said \u201cthere\u2019s some room to absorb this in the industry\u201d but there will likely be some impact over time.",
      "But Blair Robbins, who advises companies about their transportation needs as a partner with EisnerAmper, said that even if all these efforts do lead to higher rates, they would be increasing off the current lower shipping rates that are depressed because of the decline in the number of shipments in recent years. Robbins said he has seen estimates that only about 5% to 10% of the workforce might be affected, and that will happen gradually over time.",

Rogers\u2019 school, which trains hundreds of drivers every year, was not found out of compliance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been highlighting this for years,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many truck schools that just pop up, and they don\u2019t adhere to the rigorous standards set forth by either California or the FMCSA \u2013 Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\u201d",
      "Jeffery Burkhardt, who is chair of the national trucking schools group, said established schools don't have any problem complying with the standards. Burkhardt is also is senior director of operations at Ancora, which provides CDL training at colleges, community colleges and companies.",
      "\u201cFor the legitimate schools it\u2019s not a problem. We welcome it. For the illegitimate schools, it\u2019s a bad thing for them,\u201d Burkhardt said.",
      "Decertifying nearly half of all trucking schools could limit the number of new drivers and create monthslong waiting lists at the remaining schools. But Rogers and major trucking groups, including the American Trucking Association and the Owner Operator Independent Drivers Association, think it is a good idea to ensure schools are meeting the standards to prepare drivers to handle 80,000-pound trucks on highways across the country.",
      "\u201cDo you want more truck drivers that are dangerous, or do you want less truck drivers that are more competent?\u201d Rogers said. \u201cI would go with the latter.\u201d",
      "Antonio Yates said classes at the 100 Placement Truck Driving School he works at in Detroit are already full for the next two to three months, and he expects the wait time will get worse if all these schools close. He said the number of immigrants willing to pay $5,000 to learn how to operate a semitrailer truck or $3,000 to learn to drive a bus has increased over the past year or so.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re from all over, South America, Africa. They\u2019re from everywhere,\u201d said Yates, who added that most are paying for the training themselves.",
      "Yates acknowledged that understanding the English language can be tough for some.",
      "\u201cIf I can\u2019t communicate with you, I can\u2019t even train you properly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe turn people away all of the time.\u201d",

      "Cooper Flagg didn't wilt in the month the Dallas Mavericks were without injured forward Anthony Davis",
      "DALLAS -- Cooper Flagg followed Anthony Davis' bank shot with a jumper of his own, then blocked a jump hook from Anthony Wiggins at the other end before scoring a contested layup on an assist from Davis.",
      "Just like that, the rookie No. 1 overall pick and the 10-time All-Star combined to seal Dallas' 118-108 victory over the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, extending the first winning streak of the season for the Mavericks to three games.",
      "Flagg knew his NBA career would start without help on the court from star guard Kyrie Irving, who is recovering from an ACL tear last March. The 18-year-old former Duke standout also had to persevere for a month without Davis, who was sidelined with a left calf strain.",
      "A loss in Davis' return at the Los Angeles Lakers last week dropped the Mavericks to 5-15, but they won a night later without him before consecutive victories over Denver and the Heat, two teams that should be playoff contenders.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk about the stars, he didn\u2019t have the two stars on the floor, so he had to endure the best wing defender, and I thought he did an incredible job,\" coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cWhen you look at the clutch situations, he responded in a positive way. For an 18-year-old to be leaned on without AD or Kai out there, I thought he responded in a positive way.\u201d",
      "While Davis was out, Flagg found himself in the company of LeBron James a couple of times.",
      "In a 118-115 victory over New Orleans last month, Flagg had 29 points, seven rebounds and five assists. James is the only other player with at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists in a game as an 18-year-old.",
      "With Davis resting on the second night of a back-to-back in a 114-110 victory at the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday, Flagg became the youngest player in NBA history to score 35 points. He and James are the only 18-year-olds with 30-point games.",
      "\u201cI think I learned a lot throughout that period, and as a team I think we learned a lot as well,\u201d Flagg said. \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t the start we were looking for or hoping to have, but I think it\u2019ll give us a lot of gratitude moving forward. If we can find success and we can think back to a really rocky start, I think I grew a lot in that time period as well.\u201d",
      "Flagg was 9 of 13 from the field and led Dallas with 22 points against the Heat, and is shooting 57% in the four games since Davis returned. They did get five games together to start the season, but Flagg wasn't quite as assertive then.",
      "Four-time champion and 13-year veteran Klay Thompson has come out of a shooting slump recently, which also has helped ease the burden on Flagg.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much better for us when he\u2019s out there,\u201d Flagg said about Davis. \u201cI think just between him and Klay on the court at the same time, the amount of gravity that those two guys have of just pulling defenses toward them and just creating space out there, it\u2019s huge for me.\u201d",
      "It's far from a guarantee that Davis can stay healthy, with him missing more games than he has played since the oft-injured forward was acquired in the much-criticized trade that sent superstar Luka Doncic to the Lakers last February.",
      "If Davis stays on the court, Flagg will have part of the formula the Mavs envisioned with title-winning vets easing his transition to the NBA after he essentially turned pro a year earlier than other one-and-done college stars. And that's not even including Irving, who presumably could return sometime after Jan. 1.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to put your best defender on someone and so most of the time that\u2019s AD,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cSo he gets the secondary defender and for him, it\u2019s his ability to get to the paint, but also to be able to play off AD, where he doesn\u2019t have to do everything like he did here early on, where we were asking him to be the point guard, score, defend, do everything, which he\u2019s not afraid of doing, but now he has some help.\u201d",
      "Davis illustrated it by combining with Flagg to score the final eight Dallas points to stop a Miami rally close out the Heat.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met separately with President Donald Trump and Republican senators Wednesday as tech executives work to secure favorable federal policies for the artificial intelligence industry, including the limited sale of Nvidia's highly valued computer chips to U.S. rivals like China.",
      "Huang's closed-door meeting with Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee came at a moment of intensifying lobbying, soaring investments and audacious forecasts by major tech companies about AI\u2019s potential transformative effects.",
      "Huang is among the Silicon Valley executives who warn that any restrictions on the technology will halt its advancement despite mounting concerns among policymakers and the public about AI's potential pitfalls or the ways foreign rivals like China may use American hardware.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\u201d Huang told reporters before his meeting on Capitol Hill.",
      "He added that he shared concerns about selling AI chips to China but believed that restrictions haven't slowed Chinese advancement in the AI race.",
      "\u201cWe need to be able to compete around the world. The one thing we can\u2019t do is we can\u2019t degrade the chips that we sell to China. They won\u2019t accept that. There\u2019s a reason why they wouldn\u2019t accept that, and so we should offer the most competitive chips we can to the Chinese market,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang also said he\u2019d met with Trump earlier Wednesday and discussed export controls for Nvidia\u2019s chips. Huang added that he wished the president \u201ca happy holidays.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration in May reversed Biden-era restrictions that had prevented Nvidia and other chipmakers from exporting their chips to a wide range of countries. The White House in August also announced an unusual deal that would allow Nvidia and another U.S. chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices, to sell their chips in the Chinese market but would require the U.S. government to take a 15% cut of the sales.",
      "The deal divided lawmakers on Capitol Hill, where there is broad support for controls on AI exports.",
      "Members of Congress have generally considered the sale of high-end AI chips to China to be a national security risk. China is the main competitor to the U.S. in the race to develop artificial superintelligence. Lawmakers have also proposed a flurry of bills this year to regulate AI's impact on dozens of industries, though none have become law.",
      "Most Republican senators who attended the meeting with Huang declined to discuss their conversations. But a handful described the meeting as positive and productive.",

      "Asked whether he believed Nvidia's interests and goals were fully aligned with U.S. national security, Rounds replied: \u201cThey currently do not sell chips in China. And they understand that they\u2019re an American company. They want to be able to compete around the rest of the world. They\u2019d love to some time be able to compete in China again, but they recognize that export controls are important as well for our own national security.\"",

      "Conservationists are hoping to strengthen regulations at a wildlife trade conference on birds, reptiles and other animals that are seeing their numbers decline due to the exotic pet trade",
      "A growing exotic pet trade has conservationists calling for stronger regulations to protect the reptiles, birds and other animals in the wild that are increasingly showing up for sale on internet marketplaces and becoming popular on social media.",
      "The two-week Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is scheduled to run through Friday in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. Several proposals related to the pet trade will be considered Tuesday.",
      "Participants have proposed tighter regulations or complete bans on the trade of several species including iguanas from the Galapagos Islands, more than a dozen species of Latin America tarantulas and an odd-looking turtle from Africa.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is the pet trade much more looking at reptiles, amphibians. People want rare species and they don\u2019t have to go into a pet shop,\u201d said Susan Lieberman, vice president for international policy at the nonprofit Wildlife Conservation Society. \u201cThey go online and there are thousands of animals, including endangered species, illegally obtained species, all available on the internet.\u201d",
      "In the past, the trade was dominated by sales in animal parts like elephant ivory and tiger bones. But Matt Collis, the senior director of international policy at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said live animals for the pet trade are increasingly turning up on the internet.",
      "\u201cThe dramatic growth in online marketplaces has put consumers directly in touch with wildlife traders and criminals around the world,\u201d Collis said. \u201cIn today\u2019s society where pretty much anything can be bought with a click of a button and shipped anywhere in the world in a matter of days, no wildlife is safe.\u201d",
      "Social media influencers, who have made owned exotic pets cool, are also contributing to the problem, Collis said.",
      "Several of the species proposed for greater protection at the CITES conference are in Latin America, where an IFAW report last year found illegal trade is on the rise. The report, covering 18 Spanish speaking Latin American countries, says there were more than 100,000 animals seized or poached from 2017 to 2022, with seizures increasing every year.",
      "The report found the live pet trade accounted for a growing piece of the trade, with reptiles representing about 60% of the animals, while nearly 30% were birds and more than 10% were amphibians. Many animals were traded locally or regionally but there also was evidence of animals shipped to collectors in Europe, Asia and the United States.",
      "More than 90% of the seized wildlife destined for Europe were live animals, confirming the demand for pets was a key driver of the illegal trade, the report said.",
      "Among the reptile species up for tighter trade controls is Home\u2019s Hinged-back Tortoise, a critically endangered turtle found in West Africa that has a unique hinge on its back allowing it to close off its back legs and tail.",
      "There are proposals to regulate the trade in two vipers species endemic to Ethiopia, two species of rattlesnake found mostly in Mexico, the leaf-tailed gecko from Australia and two species of sloths from South America, which are increasingly turning up in sloth-themed cafes in Asia.",
      "A proposal from Ecuador would ban the trade in marine and land iguanas from the Galapagos, which are listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as critically endangered or vulnerable. There are concerns that the illegal trade could further destabilize the population, which already faces threats from invasive species, rising tourism and fluctuations in weather associated with the El Nino.",
      "In its CITES proposal, Ecuador said it doesn't permit commercial export of iguanas and collecting them from the Galapagos has been prohibited for decades. But Ecuador raised concerns that traders are capturing and transporting young iguanas by boat or overland to ports and evading authorities by mislabeling them as captive bred. Most of the iguanas are destined for Japan and other Asia countries and can sell for as much $25,000 on the black market.",

      "A species can be banned for trade in its home range but sold online by traders who abuse the CITES permitting process and captive breeding rules and then take advantage of importing countries that don't bother to check if the animals come from the wild, Collis said.",
      "\u201cIn theory, under CITES rules, the countries issuing those export permits should be checking that these animals, and crucially their parentage all the way back to the founder stock, were legally acquired in order for an export permit to be granted,\u201d Collis said. \u201cBut that is not happening.\"",
      "Countries issue permits without verifying animal origins, which helps traffickers launder animals from illegal sources, \u201cundermining the very framework meant to protect these species,\u201d he said.",
      "The CITES proposals draw attention to a long-running problem with captive breeding of exotic species, according to Lieberman of the Wildlife Conservation Society.",
      "\u201cWhen the treaty was drafted in the early 1970s, there wasn't a lot of captive breeding and people thought, 'Well, if they\u2019re bred in captivity, it\u2019ll take pressure off the wild,\u201d she said. \u201cSounds good, except it doesn\u2019t work that way. Breeding in captivity also creates a market, but they\u2019re cheaper from the wild. And also it\u2019s a great way to launder.\u201d",
      "A proposal has also been submitted at the convention to regulate the trade in more than a dozen species of tarantulas. Bolivia, Argentina and Panama note they are \u201camong the most heavily traded groups of invertebrates\u201d with more than half all species available online. The proposal would permit the trade in the spiders as long as there is proof the sources are legal, sustainable and traceable.",
      "\u201cSome tarantula species are particularly vulnerable to overexploitation due to their long life span, limited geographic range and low reproductive rate,\u201d according to the proposal. \u201cAlarmingly, most of them are not regulated internationally, despite the high availability of hundreds of species in international trade.\u201d",
      "The United States Association of Reptile Keepers opposes the tarantula listing, which it called \u201cincongruous\u201d for rolling many species into a single proposal.",
      "The association, which advocates for responsible private ownership and trade in reptiles and amphibians, suggested other reptile proposals reflect government overreach, noting the proffered changes to iguana sales are unnecessary since current regulations \u201cprovide adequate protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost species have limited trade in captive bred specimens which is not a threat to wild populations,\u201d David Garcia, the organization's legal counsel and its delegate at the CITES conference, said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately, many countries, groups, and individuals take the nonsensical position that the way to limit threats to wild populations is to make the captive reproduction of those species more difficult.",
      "But a report from the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, shared with The Associated Press and due to be released Dec. 8, found that the United States was among the biggest markets for the pet trade, importing on average 90 million live amphibians, arachnids, birds, aquarium fish, mammals and reptiles each year.",
      "\u201cWildlife exploitation, including for the pet trade, is a major driver of the global extinction crisis,\u201d the report said. \u201cOne million species are on track to face extinction in coming decades unless action is taken to address species loss. Addressing the United States\u2019 role in the exotic pet trade must be a top priority to stem this crisis and protect biodiversity for future generations.\u201d",

      "The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.",
      "The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.",

      "Here\u2019s a rundown of existing and newly released AI services that can help with your search for the perfect gift in the run-up to Christmas:",
      "Amazon led the way by rolling out its Rufus chatbot in 2024. Other ecommerce websites followed with their own AI assistants to enhance the online shopping experience.",
      "Walmart's Sparky chatbot is available on the retail giant\u2019s app and can synthesize reviews or offer product recommendations based on occasions, such as Christmas. Target recently unveiled a gift finder chatbot on its app, but it's only available for the holiday season. Ralph Lauren partnered with Microsoft on the \u201cAsk Ralph\u201d chatbot to provide style recommendations.",
      "The aim of deploying chatbots is to make it easier for people to find what they\u2019re looking for. Instead of entering search terms and keywords, you can type or use voice dictation for a conversational back-and-forth.",
      "The results, in my experience, can be mixed.",

In both cases, the results weren\u2019t quite right and didn\u2019t seem to capture the wide range of products available. Sometimes the results were completely unsuitable.",
      "I ended up doing a more painstaking search of product listings\u2019 pictures and specifications to find the right items. The problem, I suspect, is partly because I was looking for generic products. Searches for name-brand products may produce better results.",

OpenAI says it can go beyond simple questions, such as checking a price or feature that regular ChatGPT can easily answer.",
      "Google users can get a similar experience when they use its search engine in AI Mode, which recently got a big update for shopping searches. The company says users can describe what they\u2019re looking for as if talking to a friend and get an \u201cintelligently organized response\u201d based on 50 billion product listings, with pictures alongside prices, reviews and inventory info.",

      "I asked all three to find a soft cotton flannel shirt. Both ChatGPT and Perplexity asked me for specific requirements, such as budget and must-have features. ChatGPT's response was the most detailed, with options from six brands including its top pick, and included pictures, prices and point-form summaries for each shirt. It also compiled the results into a comparison table.",

      "The ministry said the app, which is available to India\u2019s 1.2 billion smartphone users, was essential in \u201ccurbing misuse of telecom resources for cyber frauds and ensuring telecom cyber security.\u201d But privacy advocates say the order marks an effort to erode user privacy and consent.",

Lamar's nod to the console \u2014 which Sony had nothing to do with \u2014 was another sign of how far the brand has penetrated the culture, in ways big and small.",

Chandler Bing on \u201cFriends\u201d played a PlayStation 1 and the title character fired at PlayStation zombies in the cult movie \u201cShaun of the Dead.\u201d",

When we came out we were a little edgy, we were a different, but it was really about being disruptive,\u201d says Eric Lempel, senior vice president for marketing, sales and business operations at Sony Interactive Entertainment. \u201cWe feel we are a premier entertainment brand, not just a gaming brand.\u201d",
      "Part of the enduring popularity of the PlayStation has been its ability to evolve with the technology, starting in 1995 by picking CD-ROMs that opened the door to 3D gaming. At the time, clunky cartridges were king.",
      "The PlayStation \u2014 sparked by a failed partnership between Nintendo and Sony \u2014 entered a marketplace dominated by Sega and Nintendo. Sony wanted to bring the arcade experience home and a crucial decision was to consult with game developers first, before building their system.",
      "\u201cSony realized they needed developers in place from the get-go before they even started designing it,\u201d says Anthony Caulfield, who with his wife, Nicola, run Gracious Films and made the independent documentary \u201cThe PlayStation Revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cHardware manufacturers up to that point basically didn\u2019t care what the developers wanted. They just made what they thought was the best piece of hardware,\u201d he says.",
      "Some critical steps helped right from the launch. Sony had a number of games ready to go, a development pipeline in place and a killer retail price \u2014 $299 \u2014 that was less expensive than the rival Sega Saturn.",
      "Sony also picked its market carefully, Caulfield says. With Sega and Nintendo largely targeting children, Sony aimed the PlayStation at teens and young adults \u2014 catnip for their younger brothers and sisters.",

The 2011 PlayStation network hack that shut down the network for 24 days didn't help. \u201cIf they got the PS4 wrong it could have been the end.\u201d",

It includes: \u201cUncharted\u201d starring Tom Holland on the big screen, \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d with Pedro Pascal on HBO, \u201cTwisted Metal\u201d on Peacock and \u201cGran Turismo\u201d with Orlando Bloom from Columbia Pictures.",

      "\u201cThey do really lend themselves to movies because they definitely led that charge of making more cinematic video game experiences,\u201d he says. It also doesn't help that Sony Pictures is nearby.",
      "Lempel says PlayStation franchises are finding new audiences in other media because, at base, they're good entertainment. \u201cWe have great stories, we\u2019ve got great IP, and it transcends the category.\u201d",
      "That has even spilled out into fashion \u2014 British Nigerian multidisciplinary artist and designer Yinka Ilori has a line of PlayStation-inspired loungewear \u2014 and footwear, thanks to rapper Travis Scott's Nike Dunk Low Cactus Jack X PlayStation sneakers.",
      "\u201cWe know that we\u2019ve struck a chord that goes just well beyond a consumer product,\u201d says Lempel. \u201cThis is something that people love. It\u2019s a big part of people\u2019s lives and they love to talk about it. They love to express it in different ways.\u201d",
      "Lempel recently got a taste of that expression firsthand. He was at a restaurant in Manhattan when he spotted the PlayStation symbols tattooed on someone\u2019s arm. \u201cThese are permanent markings on someone\u2019s body,\u201d he says in wonder. \u201cThat\u2019s the passion people have.\u201d",

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert is one of the darkest spots on Earth, a crown jewel for astronomers who flock to study the origins of the universe in this inhospitable desert along the Pacific coast.",
      "A rare confluence of factors makes the Atacama an ideal home for some of the world\u2019s biggest ground-based astronomical projects \u2014 dry climate, high altitude and, crucially, isolation from the light pollution of civilization.",
      "\u201cIt's a perfect cocktail for astronomy,\u201d said Daniela Gonz\u00e1lez, executive director of the Skies of Chile Foundation, a nonprofit that defends the quality of the country\u2019s night skies.",
      "But that may not be the case for much longer, a group of leading scientists warned in an open letter to Chile\u2019s government released Tuesday.",
      "A private company is pressing ahead with plans to construct a giant renewable energy complex in sight of one of Earth\u2019s most productive astronomical facilities \u2014 the Paranal Observatory, operated by an international consortium known as the European Southern Observatory, or ESO.",
      "In the letter, 30 renowned international astronomers, including Reinhard Genzel, a 2020 Nobel laureate in astrophysics who conducted much of his prize-winning research on black holes with the ESO-operated telescopes in the Atacama Desert, describe the project as \u201can imminent threat\u201d to humanity's ability to study the cosmos, and unlock more of its unknowns.",
      "\u201cThe damage would extend beyond Chile\u2019s borders, affecting a worldwide scientific community that relies on observations made at Paranal to study everything from the formation of planets to the early universe,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that economic development and scientific progress can and must coexist to the benefit of all people in Chile, but not at the irreversible expense of one of Earth\u2019s unique and irreplaceable windows to the universe.\u201d",
      "The scientists join a chorus of voices that have been urging the Chilean government to relocate the hydrogen-based fuel production plant since the plan was unveiled a year ago by AES Andes, an offshoot of the American-based multinational AES Corp.",
      "In response to a request for comment, AES Corp. said that its own technical studies showed the project would be fully compatible with astronomical observations and compliant with the Chilean government's strict regulations on light pollution.",
      "\"We encourage trust in the country\u2019s institutional strength, which for decades has guaranteed certainty and environmental protection for multiple productive sectors,\" the company said.",

      "The plan, which is still under environmental review, calls for 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres) of wind and solar energy farms, a desalination plant and a new port.",
      "That means not only a major increase in light pollution but also new dust, ground vibrations and heightened atmospheric turbulence that blurs stars and makes them twinkle. All of that \u2014 just 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the Paranal Observatory\u2019s high-powered telescopes \u2014 will mess the view of key astronomical targets and could obstruct scientific advances, experts say.",
      "\u201cAt the best sites in the world for astronomy, stars don't twinkle. They are very stable, and even the smallest artificial turbulence would destroy these characteristics,\u201d said Andreas Kaufer, the director of operations at ESO, which assesses that the AES project would increase light pollution by 35%.",
      "\u201cIf the sky is becoming brighter from artificial light around us, we cannot do these observations anymore. They're lost. And, since we have the biggest and most sensitive telescopes at the best spot in the world, if they're lost for us, they're lost for everyone.\"",
      "Although this controversy might be specific to Chile, home to 40% of the world\u2019s astronomy infrastructure, the project reflects the wider tension between natural darkness and industrialization tearing at countless countries as light pollution makes the night sky about 10% brighter each year.",
      "\u201cMajor observatories have been chased out to remote locations, and essentially now they\u2019re chased out to some of the last remaining dark sky locations on Earth, like the Atacama Desert, the mountain peaks of Hawaii, areas around Tucson, Arizona,\u201d said Ruskin Hartley, the executive director of DarkSky International, a Tuscon-based nonprofit founded by astronomers.",

      "\u201cWe tend to overemphasize the role of technology,\u201d said Michael Muthukrishna of the London School of Economics, the report's main author, told reporters. \u201cWe need to ensure it\u2019s not technology first, but it\u2019s people first,\u201d he said, speaking by video at the report\u2019s launch in Bangkok.",
      "The risk of exclusion is an issue for communities where most people are still struggling to access skills, electric power and internet connectivity, for older people, for people displaced by war, civil conflict and climate disasters. At the same time, such people may be \u201cinvisible\u201d in data that will not take them into account, the report said.",
      "\u201cAs a general-purpose technology, AI can lift productivity, spark new industries, and help latecomers catch up,\u201d the report says.",

      "Still, even in wealthy nations like the United States, the potential for data centers to devour too large a share of electricity and water has raised concerns. Ramping up power generation to meet higher demand may hinder progress in limiting the emissions of carbon from burning fossil fuels that contribute to global warming, while also causing health hazards.",

But artificial intelligence also is playing a role in evaluating students. Some highly selective schools are adopting AI tools to vet the increasingly curated application packages that some students develop with the help of high-priced admissions consultants.",
      "The California Institute of Technology is launching an AI tool this fall to look for \u201cauthenticity\u201d in students who submit research projects with their applications, admissions director Ashley Pallie said.

      "The prevalence of AI usage is difficult to gauge because it is such a new trend, said Ruby Bhattacharya, chair of the admission practices committee at the National Association for College Admission Counseling. NACAC updated its ethics guide this fall to add a section on artificial intelligence. It urges colleges to ensure the way they use it \u201caligns with our shared values of transparency, integrity, fairness and respect for student dignity.\u201d",

      "Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season",
      "NEW YORK -- Major retail chains and tech companies are offering new or updated artificial intelligence tools in time for the holiday shopping season, hoping to give consumers an easier gift-buying experience and themselves an augmented share of online spending.",
      "Although AI-powered purchases are in early stages, the shopping assistants and agents rolled out by the likes of Walmart, Amazon and Google can do more than the chatbots of holidays past. The latest versions were designed to provide personalized product recommendations, track prices and to place some orders through unscripted \u201cconversations\u201d with customers.",
      "Those features are on top of shopping updates from AI platforms like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google Gemini. In one of the season's most talked-about launches, Google this month introduced an AI agent that can be instructed to call local stores to ask if a desired product is in stock.",
      "San Francisco software company Salesforce estimated that AI would influence $73 billion, or 22%, of all global sales in one way or another from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving through Monday after the holiday, according to Caila Schwartz, Salesforce\u2019s director of consumer insights.",
      "The figure, which stood at $60 billion a year ago, encompasses everything from a ChatGPT query to AI-supplied gift suggestions on a retailer\u2019s website, Schwartz said.",
      "Despite the advancements, AI\u2019s impact on holiday shopping will be \u201crelatively limited\u201d this year since not every shopping site has useful tools and not every shopper is willing to try them, said Brad Jashinsky, a senior retail industry analyst at information technology research and consulting firm Gartner.",
      "\u201cThe more retailers that launch these tools, the better they get, and the more that consumers get comfortable and start to seek them out,\u201d Jashinsky said. \"But customer behavior takes a long time to change.\u201d",
      "Here are three ways the technology is poised to influence holiday shopping habits in 2025:",
      "AI's potential to simplify the search for the perfect present is most apparent so far in tools that promise to give shoppers faster and more detailed results than a web browser with a lot fewer clicks.",
      "OpenAI upgraded ChatGPT with a shopping research feature that provides personalized buyers' guides. The information comes from product pages, reviews. prices and a user's previous interactions with the chatbot. The tool works best for complicated products like electronics and appliances, or for \u201cdetail-heavy\u201d items like beauty or sporting goods, OpenAI said.",
      "Then there's Rufus, the shopping assistant that Amazon rolled out last year. It now remembers information customers previously fed it, like having four children that all like board games, for example. A user's browsing and purchase history and reviews are used to personalize recommendations.",
      "Google upgraded its AI Mode search tool to provide answers to detailed questions composed in natural language. For example, users can tell the agent they want to buy a casual sweater to wear with skirt or jeans in New York in January that goes with a skirt or jeans,",
      "Responses are pulled from Google's 50 billion product listings. The tool can also produce charts with side-by-side comparisons of prices, features, reviews and other factors. Previously, shoppers had to use keywords, filters and product links to find the information they needed.",
      "\u201cThis is an expansionary moment, I think, for all of technology and for commerce,\u201d Lilian Rincon, vice president of product, consumer shopping at Google, recently told The Associated Press.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart\u2019s AI shopping assistant, Sparky, offers occasion-based recommendations and synthesizes reviews. An AI-powered gift finder on Target's app exclusively for the holidays responds to prompts such as the age and special hobbies of the recipient.",
      "Tools for tracking online prices have been around for years, including CamelCamelCamel, a third-party service for Amazon prices, as well as Paypal\u2019s Honey browser extension for monitoring thousands of online shops.",

      "Google, which for years had a basic price tracker, launched a more advanced version that lets users refine their requests with details like a garment's size and color. Microsoft's Copilot also launched a price tracker this year.",
      "Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, said he thinks the new pricing tools will add more pressure on retailers to make sure their prices are competitive.",
      "\u201cA lot of consumers that weren\u2019t even looking for price alerts are going to discover price alerts for the first time,\u201d Goldberg predicted.",
      "Amazon, OpenAI and Google are racing to create tools that would allow for seamless AI-powered shopping by taking consumers from browsing to buying within the same program instead of having to go to a retailer's website to complete a purchase.",
      "OpenAI launched a new instant checkout feature that lets users buy products suggested by ChatGPT without leaving the app. Users can order merchandise from Etsy sellers and from some brands that use Shopify, including Glossier, Skims and Spanx.",
      "OpenAI and Walmart announced a similar deal in October, saying the partnership would allow ChatGPT members to use the instant checkout feature to shop for nearly everything available on Walmart\u2019s website except for fresh food. For now, however, the feature only supports buying one item at a time.",
      "A different deal Target struck with OpenAI lets shoppers put multiple items in a cart on ChatGPT, including fresh food products. But when customers are ready to pay for their orders, they are directed away from the chatbot to the Target app.",
      "New tools from Amazon and Google will give shoppers a taste of having autonomous AI assistants do the buying for them. While the services still are limited, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is intended to be more independent and advanced than the generative AI chatbots that excel at research and writing, experts say.",
      "Amazon is now letting Rufus automatically purchase items for customers who click an \u201cauto buy\u201d button while setting up price alerts. Once a product's price drops to the desired level, customers receive notice of their completed orders and have a limited window to cancel, the company said.",
      "The e-commerce giant also started allowing shoppers to use Rufus searches for brand-name products on the Amazon app as a gateway to other retailers. If Amazon doesn't carry a desired item in its store, a \u201cShop Direct\u201d button will take them to the website of a place that does.",
      "Google's AI Mode price tracker also includes a \u201cbuy for me\u201d option that automatically makes a customer's purchase through Google Pay when the price is right. The feature is available for products sold by Wayfair, Chewy, Quince and some Shopify merchants, and Google expects to keep adding more stores, the company said. sellers.",
      "Google also expanded its web browser with an automated AI call feature that phones local businesses on behalf of customers looking for information or specific products. Google's program discloses to the store that it's an AI caller, and stores can choose not to participate, the company said.",
      "Google said it's applying the feature initially to specific product categories: toys, health and beauty, and electronics. Target and Walmart declined to comment on whether this type of service would be part of their future plans.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida\u2019s Republican-controlled House is holding the first meeting of its select committee on congressional redistricting Thursday, as the state becomes the latest to consider redrawing electoral maps amid a partisan battle for every edge in next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "The national wave of redistricting efforts was instigated by President Donald Trump, who hopes to buck the historical trend of the president\u2019s party losing seats in midterms, and his allies are wagering that his adopted home state could yield three to five more seats for Republicans. Each seat is crucial, because Democrats need a net gain of just three to control the chamber.",
      "But the push for redistricting faces major challenges in Florida due to bitter infighting between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and leaders in the GOP-dominated Legislature, along with a provision in the state Constitution that explicitly bars redrawing maps with the intent to \u201cfavor or disfavor a political party or an incumbent.\u201d",
      "DeSantis has voiced support for redistricting and even called for a redo of the 2020 U.S. census, claiming that Florida was shortchanged in the count, which determines how many congressional seats each state gets.",
      "\u201cWe are going to press this issue,\u201d DeSantis said in August.",
      "This week, in an interview with online outlet The Floridian, DeSantis floated the possibility of calling lawmakers back in a special session if they do not get redistricting done in the regular session, which is scheduled for Jan. 13 to March 13.",

      "CARROLLTON, Ga. -- Republican Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is allowed to loan $10 million to his campaign for governor, Georgia's ethics panel said Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Chris Carr, who is running against Jones, alleged it evaded campaign finance restrictions. But Georgia Ethics Commission decided in a meeting in Carrollton, Georgia, that a loan to a leadership committee counts as a contribution under state law, adopting a legal opinion that there is \u201cnothing in the current statute which prohibits such a loan of personal funds.\u201d",
      "The opinion clears Jones to keep spending his family fortune to pursue the Republican nomination. Carr and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger are the other two top candidates in the GOP governor's primary. They're vying to succeed Gov. Brian Kemp, who legally can\u2019t run again after two terms, along with numerous Democrats.",
      "Republican and Democratic primaries are in May, followed by the general election in November 2026.",

But candidates can't establish leadership committees until they win their party\u2019s nomination for governor or lieutenant governor.",
      "Instead, they are limited to candidate committees, which can raise a maximum of $8,400 from each donor. As the incumbent lieutenant governor, Jones controls a leadership committee, as does Kemp.",

      "Jones filed documents showing he made loans of $7.5 million and $2.5 million to the WBJ Leadership Committee when he announced his run for governor on July 8.",

      "Carr announced his run for governor last year, saying he needed to raise money because he isn\u2019t personally wealthy. Like Jones, Raffensperger has substantial personal wealth. Supporters of Carr have established an independent committee, but it can't coordinate with Carr's campaign.",
      "Carr also sued in federal court to try to block Jones\u2019 use his leadership committee. But in August, U.S. District Judge Victoria Marie Calvert dismissed the lawsuit, ruling that Carr should have challenged the constitutionality of the law. She said it was wrong to sue Jones and his campaign for \u201cdoing exactly what Georgia law allows them to do.\u201d",

      "As part of a broader initiative to control the entry of foreigners into the U.S., the State Department has said all those who require visas to enter the country would need to submit to an in-person interview and screening to vet them for potential national security risks.",
      "This has led to lengthy wait times at many embassies and consulates for interviews to apply for what are known as \u201cB1\u201d and \u201cB2\u201d visas despite a surge in consular staffing.",
      "Last month, Trump announced a new initiative, dubbed \u201cFIFA Pass,\u201d for foreigners traveling to the U.S. for the World Cup that will allow them to get interviews for visas more quickly. Nonetheless, he still encouraged them to apply for their visas \u201cright away.\u201d",

      "The University of Arizona Wild Cat Research and Conservation Center says it's the fifth big cat over the last 15 years to be spotted in the area after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The animal was captured by the camera as it visited a watering hole in November, its distinctive spots setting it apart from previous sightings.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very excited. It signifies this edge population of jaguars continues to come here because they\u2019re finding what they need,\" Susan Malusa, director of the center's jaguar and ocelot project, said during an interview Thursday.",
      "The team is now working to collect scat samples to conduct genetic analysis and determine the sex and other details about the new jaguar, including what it likes to eat. The menu can include everything from skunks and javelina to small deer.",
      "As an indicator species, Malusa said the continued presence of big cats in the region suggests a healthy landscape but that climate change and border barriers can threaten migratory corridors. She explained that warming temperatures and significant drought increase the urgency to ensure connectivity for jaguars with their historic range in Arizona.",
      "More than 99% of the jaguar\u2019s range is found in Central and South America, and the few male jaguars that have been spotted in the U.S. are believed to have dispersed from core populations in Mexico, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Officials have said that jaguar breeding in the U.S. has not been documented in more than 100 years.",

      "Recent detection data supports findings that a jaguar appears every few years, Malusa said, with movement often tied to the availability of water. When food and water are plentiful, there's less movement.",
      "In the case of Jaguar #5, she said it was remarkable that the cat kept returning to the area over a 10-day period. Otherwise, she described the animals as quite elusive.",

      "MORRO BAY, Calif. -- On a jagged coastline in Central California, brown pelicans gather on rock promontories, packed in like edgy commuters as they take flight to feed on a vast school of fish just offshore. The water churns in whitecaps as the big-billed birds plunge beneath the surface in search of northern anchovies, Pacific sardines and mackerel.",
      "If awkward and wobbly in appearance on land, they are graceful once airborne. The signature pouch dangling beneath the lower bill can scoop up to 3 gallons of water with every dip into the ocean \u2014 the largest pouch of any bird in the world.",
      "It is what scientists call a \u201cfeeding frenzy.\u201d And it is an encouraging sign for a bird that has struggled in recent years with a warming ocean, inconsistent breeding patterns and toxic algae blooms in Southern California.",
      "\u201cI would say the populations are somewhat stable, but some events are concerning,\u201d says marine ornithologist Tammy Russell, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego, Scripps Institution of Oceanography.",
      "The gorging seabirds are a \u201cgood sign for the marine environment,\u201d Russell said.",
      "On this warm, clear day, thousands of birds have populated the nearby beaches and cliffs, drawn by the abundant food. Cormorants and gulls mix with the pelicans. The incessant roar of the waves and the chorus of bird cries are all that can be heard on this jutting jawbone of coast.",
      "The bird\u2019s range along the Pacific coast extends from British Columbia, Canada, into Mexico. In their struggle for survival, Russell notes that the California brown pelican was once on the federal endangered species list, after a sharp population decline was attributed to the pesticide DDT, which causes eggshell thinning. The population recovered, and the bird was removed from the list in 2009, though it still faces multiple challenges.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Navy admiral who reportedly issued orders for the U.S. military to fire upon survivors of an attack on an alleged drug boat is expected Thursday on Capitol Hill to provide a classified briefing to top congressional lawmakers overseeing national security.",
      "The information from Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, who is now the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, comes at a potentially crucial moment in the unfolding congressional investigation into how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth handled the military operation in international waters near Venezuela. There are mounting questions over whether the strike may have violated the law.",
      "Lawmakers are seeking a full accounting of the strikes after The Washington Post reported that Bradley on Sept. 2 ordered an attack on two survivors to comply with Hegseth's directive to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d Legal experts say the attack amounts to a crime if the survivors were targeted, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are demanding accountability.",
      "Bradley will speak to a handful of top congressional leaders, including the Republican chairs and ranking Democrats of the House and Senate committees on Armed Services, and separately to the GOP chairman and Democratic vice chairman on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly serious matter. This is about the safety of our troops. This is an incident that could expose members of our armed services to legal consequences,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a floor speech Wednesday. \u201cAnd yet the American public and the Congress are still not hearing basic facts.\u201d",
      "As Bradley appears for questions in the classified setting, lawmakers will be seeking answers to key questions: What orders did Hegseth give regarding the operations? And what was the reasoning for the second strike?",
      "Democratic lawmakers are also demanding that the Trump administration release the full video of the Sept. 2 attack, as well as written records of the orders and any directives from Hegseth. While Republicans, who control the national security committees, have not publicly called for those documents, they have pledged a thorough review.",
      "\u201cThe investigation is going to be done by the numbers,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out the ground truth.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has stood behind Hegseth as he defends his handling of the attack, but pressure is mounting on the defense secretary.",
      "Hegseth has said the aftermath of an initial strike on the boat was clouded in the \u201cfog of war.\u201d He has also said he \u201cdidn\u2019t stick around\u201d for the second strike, but said Bradley \u201cmade the right call\u201d and \u201chad complete authority\u201d to do it.",
      "Also on Thursday, the Defense Department inspector general was expected to release a partially redacted report into Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app in March to share information about a military strike against Yemen\u2019s Houthi militants.",
      "The report found that Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk by using Signal, according to two people familiar with the findings. The Pentagon, however, has cast the report as an exoneration of Hegseth.",
      "At the time of the attack, Bradley was the commander of Joint Special Operations Command, overseeing coordinated operations between the military's elite special operations units out of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. About a month after the strike, he was promoted to commander of U.S. Special Operations Command.",

      "Ana Walshe, a real estate agent who immigrated from Serbia, was last seen early on Jan. 1, 2023, following a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner at her Massachusetts home. Her body has never been found. Her husband, Brian Walshe faces a first-degree murder charge, after agreeing to plead guilty last month to lesser charges of misleading police and willfully disposing of a human body in violation of state law.",
      "William Fastow told the court on the fourth day of the trial that he met Ana Walshe in March 2022 when he sold her a townhouse in Washington, D.C. He said the relationship quickly intensified as they became close friends and confidants and eventually had an \"intimate relationship.\u201d They went out to dinner and to bars together, he said, and she would spend time on his sailboat and stay overnight at his home. They also took a Thanksgiving trip to Ireland.",
      "Fastow testified he never tried to keep their relationship secret and told others about their relationship, though he admitted they never socialized with her friends. They did, however, discuss telling Brian Walshe about it.",
      "\u201cAna felt it was really important that when Brian was to find about relationship that he would hear it from her,\u201d Fastow said. \u201cShe had expressed great concern and I think she felt it would be a strike against her integrity if he found out a different way.\u201d",
      "Fastow said the pair spent Christmas Eve together with friends and had planned to celebrate New Year's together on Jan. 4, when they would discuss their plans for the future.",
      "\u201cWe'd had a number of conversations about what a life together might look like, what merging two families would look like,\u201d he testified. \u201cBut I'd always said to Ana that she needed to figure out how she wanted things with Brian and what she wanted that to look for her life before we could make any commitments or decisions.\u201d",
      "Fastow said his last contact with Ana Walshe was a text message from her on New Year's Eve. The following day he sent her a photo of Fastow showing his son how to ski, a waving hand emoji, question mark query and a few more text messages the following days that got no response. He tried calling her several times on Jan. 2 but the calls went straight to voicemail. Then, on Jan. 4, he got a call from Brian Walshe, but let it go to voicemail because he was in an \u201cintimate relationship with his wife.\u201d",

      "Trump hasn't nominated anyone to serve as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in March. When his 120-day term elapsed, judges in the district declined to keep him in the post.",

      "Justice Department lawyers argued in court papers that the U.S. attorney general has \u201cunquestioned authority\u201d to appoint attorneys within her department and to delegate her functions to those attorneys. And they argue that even if Sarcone is not properly holding the office of acting U.S. attorney, he can still conduct grand jury investigations as a special attorney.",

      "A similar dynamic is playing out in Nevada, where a federal judge disqualified the Trump administration\u2019s pick to be U.S. attorney there. And a federal judge in Los Angeles disqualified the acting U.S. attorney in Southern California from several cases after concluding he had stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law.",

      "NEW YORK -- A high-stakes hearing in the New York murder case against Luigi Mangione continues Thursday, a year to the day after prosecutors say he gunned down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to both state and federal charges. Before any trials get scheduled, his lawyers are trying to preclude the eventual jurors from hearing about his alleged statements to law enforcement officers and items \u2014 including a gun and a notebook \u2014 allegedly seized from his backpack.",
      "The evidence is key to prosecutors' case. They have said that the 9 mm handgun matches the firearm used in the killing, that writings in the notebook laid out Mangione's disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference, and that he gave Pennsylvania police the same fake name that the alleged gunman used at a New York hostel days before the shooting.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot from behind as he walked to an investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. He became UnitedHealthcare's CEO in 2021 and had worked within parent UnitedHealth Group Inc. for 20 years.",
      "The hearing, which started Monday and could extend to next week, applies only to the state case. But it is giving the public an extensive preview of some testimony, video, 911 audio and other records relevant to both cases.",
      "It's not immediately clear what witnesses or evidence are expected Thursday.",
      "Tuesday's court session displayed police body-camera video of officers confronting Mangione at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and concluding \u2014 to their amazement \u2014 that he was the much-publicized suspect in Thompson's killing five days earlier.",
      "They interacted with Mangione for roughly 20 minutes before telling him he had the right to remain silent. The officers asked his name, whether he\u2019d been in New York recently and other questions, including: \u201cWhy are you nervous?\u201d",

About 15 minutes in, they warned him that he was being investigated and would be arrested if he repeated what they'd determined was a fake name.",

      "Mangione's lawyers argue that his statements shouldn't be allowed as trial evidence because officers started questioning him before reading his rights. The defense contends the backpack items should be excluded because police didn\u2019t get a warrant before searching his bag.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors haven't yet detailed their arguments for allowing the disputed evidence. Federal prosecutors have maintained that police were justified in searching the backpack to ensure there was nothing dangerous inside and that Mangione's statements to officers were voluntary and made before he was under arrest.",

The U.S. leader hasn't been shy about his desire to receive the honor.",

      "\u201cWe want these kids to know that not only do their families care, but their communities care, their government, their country cares about them,\u201d said Susan Dell. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all rooting for them to have a wonderful future, a bright future, and that that\u2019s available to them.\u201d",
      "Under the new law, \u201cTrump Accounts\u201d are available to any American child under 18 with a Social Security number and their families can fund the accounts, which must be invested in an index fund that tracks the overall stock market. When the children turn 18, they can withdraw the funds to put toward their education, to buy a home or to start a business.",
      "The Dells will put money into the accounts of children 10 and younger who live in ZIP codes with a median family income of $150,000 or less and who won't get the $1,000 seed money from the Treasury. The Dells hope their gift will encourage families to claim the accounts and deposit more money into it, even small amounts, so it will grow over time along with the stock market.",
      "President Trump plans to celebrate the commitment later on Tuesday and a White House spokesperson Kush Desai said the Dell's gift will be the first of many new pledges to fund the accounts.",
      "\u201cThe One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s Trump Accounts are a revolutionary investment by the federal government into the next generation of American children,\u201d Desai said. \u201cIt\u2019s also President Trump\u2019s call to action for American businesses and philanthropists to do their part, too.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to give effective dollars away at scale, particularly to the country\u2019s neediest kids in a way that you have confidence that those dollars are going to compound with the upside of the U.S. economy,\" Brad Gerstner, a venture capitalist, who advocated for the passage of this legislation. \"And so, this is a unique platform that\u2019s being created by the government that I think can unlock major giving.\u201d",
      "Gerstner is also the founder of Invest America Charitable Foundation, which is supporting the Treasury in launching the accounts. He said the goal of the accounts is to give young people funds to jump start their lives but also to help them benefit from the growth of the U.S. economy through investing in stocks.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, we need to include everybody in the upside of the American experiment. Otherwise, it won\u2019t last. And so, at its core, we think it can re-energize people\u2019s belief in free market, capitalist democracy,\u201d\u2033 Gerstner said of the accounts.",

      "President Donald Trump has long praised tariffs as key to increasing wealth in the United States, idealizing Gilded Age policies that preceded the implementation of a modern federal income tax.",
      "Among the potential benefits, Trump claims, is the ability to replace revenue from federal income taxes with money the U.S. is taking in from tariffs \u2014 a concept he has touted since his 2024 presidential campaign, most recently at a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.",
      "But tariff revenue doesn't even come close to where it would need to be if federal income taxes were eliminated, and experts say such a plan isn't at all feasible.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The U.S. is earning enough revenue from tariffs to eventually eliminate federal income taxes.",
      "THE FACTS: This is false. Individual income taxes brought in trillions more dollars than tariffs did in the last fiscal year, accounting for more than 50% of total U.S. revenue, according to Treasury Department data. Tariffs made up only 3.7% of the total. In the first month of the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, individual income taxes accounted for 54% of total revenue. Tariffs made up 7.75%.",
      "Trump's proposal wouldn't work regardless, according to experts, given the unreliability of tariff revenue as well as the harmful effects of tariffs on economic growth and their outsize impact on lower earners.",
      "\u201cIt's not possible. It's not feasible mathematically or economically,\u201d said Brandon DeBot, senior attorney adviser and policy director at New York University's Tax Law Center. \u201cAnd analysts from a range of different perspectives agree with that conclusion. Even the very substantial tariffs imposed this year, which are at the highest levels in the postwar era, raise nowhere near the revenue that income tax does.\u201d",
      "Steve Wamhoff, federal policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, called the idea \u201cnonsensical.\u201d",
      "But Trump has floated it twice in the last week \u2014 first during remarks on Thanksgiving at Mar-a-Lago and then again at Tuesday's Cabinet meeting.",
      "\u201cAnd I believe that at some point in the not too distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay. Because the money we're taking in is so great, it's so enormous, that you're not going to have income tax to pay,\u201d he said at the meeting, which lasted more than two hours.",
      "In the last fiscal year, Treasury Department data shows that revenue from individual income taxes was approximately $2.66 trillion out of about $5.23 trillion in total revenue. Corporation income taxes added approximately $452 billion. Customs duties earned nearly $195 billion. That's a difference of around $2.8 trillion.",
      "The current fiscal year is shaping up in a similar fashion. Individual income taxes took in about $217 billion out of approximately $404 billion in total revenue the first month, with about $15 billion in additional funds from corporation taxes. Tariffs, meanwhile, earned around $31 billion.",

      "Trump has boasted of additional income from investments in the U.S. by other countries and international companies. But the precise terms of these investments have yet to be fully codified and released to the public, and some numbers are under dispute or involve potentially fuzzy math.",
      "The modern federal income tax was created with the ratification of 16th Amendment in 1913, ending the 43-year era when Trump says the country was wealthiest. He has not expressly detailed plans to end a national income tax since retaking the White House, and he can\u2019t do so without an act of Congress and upending the federal budget.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\u201d said White House spokesman Kush Desai. He also cited \u201ctrillions in historic investment commitments to make and hire in America\u201d that have been fueled by tariffs.",
      "It is actually importers \u2014 American companies \u2014 that pay tariffs. Those companies typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Foreign companies might have to cut prices \u2014 and sacrifice profits \u2014 to offset the tariffs and try to maintain their market share in the United States.",
      "Even if the numbers were made to add up, replacing revenue from federal income taxes with that of tariffs \u2014 a Republican talking point since the 1990s \u2014 poses many risks. Tariffs, especially at rates needed to make up for a loss in federal income taxes, could lead to retaliation from other countries and a lack of imports. In fact, revenue could start going down the more tariffs go up. There is also a lot of uncertainty about how much revenue tariffs will actually take in, given periodic changes to Trump's policies.",
      "\u201cWe would be talking about living in a completely different world than the one we live in now,\u201d said Wamhoff. \u201cThere was a time when the government's finances were provided through tariffs. But I believe people were getting around with a horse and buggy back then and not cars. I mean, that was a completely different time.\u201d",
      "Another reality is currently playing out. Trump's tariffs are the subject of a Supreme Court case and could be struck down if the justices decide he does not have the authority to implement them. However, the president will still have plenty of options to keep taxing imports aggressively even if the courts rule against him. For example, he can reuse tariff powers he deployed in his first term and can reach for others, including one that dates back to the Great Depression. Many companies \u2014 including Costco \u2014 aren't waiting for a decision from the Supreme Court. Instead, they're filing suits against the Trump administration demanding refunds on the tariffs they've paid.",
      "Experts say there is also an issue of fairness, noting that tariffs would shift the tax burden to lower-income households given their propensity to increase costs on consumer goods. Plus, they lack the flexibility of income taxes, which can be set at any desired rate, and they wouldn't allow for incentives such as charitable donations or child tax credits.",
      "\u201cInequality is very highly skewed toward the top,\u201d said Michael Graetz, a professor of tax law at Yale University. \u201cWe've got more billionaires than we've ever had. We've got more millionaires than we've ever had. So it's a strange time to be reducing the tax burden on the top and increasing it on the middle. It's a proposal that is very effective for fundraising for Republicans and it always has been.\u201d",

      "Billionaire spacewalker Jared Isaacman is back before the Senate after being yanked and then renominated by President Donald Trump for NASA's top job",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Billionaire spacewalker Jared Isaacman urged senators on Wednesday to take swift action on his bid to lead NASA, after being yanked and then renominated by President Donald Trump.",
      "Isaacman appeared before the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee in Washington eight months after his first nomination hearing. The tech entrepreneur who's rocketed into orbit twice with SpaceX stressed the need for \u201cfull-time leadership\u201d at NASA as the space agency prepares to send astronauts back to the moon early next year.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been filling in as NASA's acting administrator since summer.",
      "Returning astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years will be \u201ca challenging endeavor to say the least,\u201d Isaacman told the committee led by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.",
      "NASA is targeting early next year for a lunar flyaround by four astronauts. They won't land on the moon; that would happen in another mission. The goal is to beat the Chinese there by the end of the decade.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time for delay but a time for action because if we fall behind -- if we make a mistake -- we may never catch up, and the consequences could shift the balance of power here on Earth,\u201d Isaacman told the committee.",
      "Cruz agreed. \u201cNASA cannot take its eyes off the ball,\u201d he said, referring to China's looming moon plans. \u201cThe United States must remain the unquestioned leader in space exploration.\"",

      "President Donald Trump's administration says it will withhold money to help manage SNAP food aid from states that don't give the federal government information on individual recipients",
      "U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said this week that the federal government would start withholding money to help run the SNAP food aid program from states that don't provide data on participants, including their immigration status.",
      "The department said the government needs the data to spot fraud in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which helps 42 million Americans, or about 1 in 8, buy groceries.",
      "The plan to withhold the administrative funds is an escalation of a legal battle that's been going on since shortly after President Donald Trump took office. It's decidedly partisan. Only states led by Democrats have failed to provide the information the administration seeks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "SNAP costs federal taxpayers about $100 billion a year. Of that, about $94 billion goes to benefits and the rest to administrative costs.",
      "The federal government currently reimburses about half the states\u2019 cost to manage SNAP, though that\u2019s scheduled to drop to 25% next October.",
      "The amount states receive varies widely, as does the portion of state SNAP funding that goes to administrative costs. When excluding bonus funds for the coronavirus pandemic, Wyoming, for example, got less than $9 million for administering SNAP during the 2023 fiscal year, the most recent time frame for which data is available. That represented 12% of its SNAP funding. California, the most populous state, received more than $1.2 billion for SNAP administration, nearly 10% of its total SNAP allocation. Florida received $84 million for administration, a little over 1% of its overall federal SNAP funding.",
      "Some experts have warned that shifting costs to states \u2014 even short of withholding them entirely \u2014 could be such a major expense that some could drop SNAP.",
      "Some states already are bracing to take on more of the costs. Connecticut recently set aside $500 million to offset potential federal funding cuts to states. It\u2019s up to Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, to decide whether to tap that for SNAP costs.",
      "USDA plans to notify states that have not provided the requested information that they're not in compliance as soon as next week. The states would have more time to comply.",
      "And after that, they could appeal.",

      "One state \u2014 Nevada, which has a Republican governor and Democratic attorney general \u2014 has both complied and sued. Kansas, with a Democratic governor and Republican attorney general, has neither complied nor sued.",
      "Whether the administration's latest effort will be allowed is another question likely to be resolved by courts, too.",
      "Rollins has said findings from the states that complied with the request have shed a new light on fraud.",
      "She has said that it revealed 186,000 deceased people receiving benefits and about 500,000 getting them in more than one place. It's not clear just how many of those instances represent fraud versus people dying or moving and the systems not catching up immediately \u2014 or how many are cases involving fictitious people created by criminal operations to receive benefits illegally.",

      "Pat Mitchell Worley, president and CEO of the Soulsville Foundation, confirmed Cropper's death to CBS News. The foundation operates the Stax Museum of American Soul Music in Memphis, located at the site of the former Stax Records, where Cropper worked for years.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately known. Longtime associate Eddie Gore told The Associated Press he was with Cropper on Tuesday at a rehabilitation facility in Nashville, where Cropper had been after a recent fall. Cropper had been working on new music when Gore visited, he said.",
      "\"He's such a good human,\" Gore said. \"We were blessed to have him, for sure.\"",
      "\"Steve was a beloved musician, songwriter, and producer whose extraordinary talent touched the lives of millions worldwide,\" Cropper's family said in a statement released through the foundation, describing his \"influence on American music is immeasurable.\"",
      "\"Every note he played, every song he wrote, and every artist he inspired ensure that his spirit and artistry will continue to move people for generations to come,\" the family wrote.",
      "The guitarist, songwriter and record producer was not known for flashy playing, but his spare, catchy licks and solid rhythm chops helped define Memphis soul music. At a time when it was common for White musicians to co-opt the work of Black artists and make more money from their songs, Cropper was that rare White artist willing to keep a lower profile and collaborate.",
      "Cropper was celebrated, respected by fellow guitarists",
      "Cropper's very name was immortalized in the 1967 smash \"Soul Man,\" recorded by Sam & Dave. Midway, singer Sam Moore calls out \"Play it, Steve!\" as Cropper pulls off a tight, ringing riff, a slide sound that Cropper used a Zippo lighter to create. The exchange was reenacted in the late 1970s when Cropper joined the John Belushi-Dan Aykroyd act \"The Blues Brothers\" and played on their hit cover of \"Soul Man.\"",
      "In a 2020 interview with AP, Cropper discussed his career and how he mastered the art of filling gaps with an essential lick or two.",
      "\"I listen to the other musicians and the singer,\" Cropper said. \"I'm not listening to just me. I make sure I'm sounding OK before we start the session. Once we've presented the song, then I listen to the song and the way they interpret it. And I play around all that stuff. That's what I do. That's my style.\"",
      "Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, asked once about Cropper, said simply, \"Perfect, man.\" On a YouTube instructional video, guitar virtuoso Joe Bonamassa says Cropper's moves are often copied.",
      "\"If you haven't heard the name Steve Cropper, you've heard him in song,\" Bonamassa said.",
      "Cropper was born near Dora, Missouri, but moved with his family to Memphis when he was 9 and got his first mail-order guitar at age 14, according to his website, playitsteve.com. Chuck Berry, Jimmy Reed and Chet Atkins were among his early influences.",
      "Cropper was a Stax artist before the label was even called Stax, which Jim Stewart and Estelle Axton had founded as Satellite Records in 1957. In the early 1960s, Satellite signed up Cropper and his instrumental band the Royals Spades. The band soon changed its name to the Mar-Keys and had a hit with \"Last Night.\"",
      "Satellite was later renamed Stax, where some of the Mar-Keys became the label's horn section while Cropper and other Mar-Keys formed Booker T. and the M.G.'s. Featuring Cropper, keyboard player Booker T. Jones, bassist Donald \"Duck\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, they were known for their hit instrumentals \"Green Onions,\" \"Hang 'Em High\" and \"Time Is Tight,\" and backed Otis Redding, Sam & Dave and others.",
      "Cropper co-wrote \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\" weeks before Redding's death",
      "In a 2017 interview with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Cropper recounted playing guitar behind Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival in a legendary 1967 performance that helped put Redding on the map.",
      "\"We had no idea what the reaction was gonna be. And it was unbelievable,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "In late November of 1967, Cropper said Redding brought him a song the now-legendary singer had started writing on a houseboat overlooking San Francisco Bay that would become \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay.\"",
      "\"That afternoon, it was done,\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"We went and cut it the next day. I think there's three takes of it.\"",
      "A few weeks later, on Dec. 10, 1967, Redding died in a small plane crash near Madison, Wisconsin, at the age of 26.",
      "\"And I said, 'I just lost my best friend,'\" Cropper told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Cropper returned to the studio to put the finishing touches on the song, and \"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay,\" released in January 1968, became the first posthumous No. 1 record on the Billboard charts. It won Redding and Cropper the Grammy for Best R&B song, with Redding also winning Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. broke barriers",
      "Booker T. and the M.G.'s. was a racially integrated band, a rarity in its day. It was so admired that even non-Stax artists recorded with them, notably Wilson Pickett. Jones, who is the only surviving member of the band, and Jackson are Black. Dunn and Cropper are white.",
      "\"When you walked in the door at Stax, there was absolutely no color,\" Cropper said in the AP interview. \"We were all there for the same reason \u2014 to get a hit record.\"",
      "In the mid-1960s, Atlantic Records executive Jerry Wexler brought Pickett to work with the Stax musicians. During a 2015 gathering with the National Music Publishers Association, Cropper acknowledged he had never heard of Pickett before working with him. He found some gospel recordings by Pickett, was taken by the line \"I'll see my Jesus in the midnight hour\" and with a slight change helped write a secular standard.",
      "\"The man up there has been forgiving me for this ever since!\" he said.",
      "Cropper was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 as a member of Booker T. and the M.G.'s. That year, Cropper, Dunn and Jones played in an all-star tribute at Madison Square Garden to Bob Dylan. Al Jackson died in 1975, Dunn in 2012.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine ranked Cropper 39th on its 100 Greatest Guitarists list, calling him \"the secret ingredient in some of the greatest rock and soul songs.\"",
      "Cropper was in the 1980 movie \"The Blues Brothers\" and its follow-up, \"Blues Brothers 2000,\" portraying \"The Colonel\" in the Blues Brothers band. In real life, he toured with them.",
      "He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005, and two years later received a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement.",
      "Cropper continued recording into his later years, including 2024's \"Friendlytown,\" which was nominated for a Grammy. Earlier this year, Cropper received the Tennessee Governor's Arts Award, the state's highest honor in the arts.",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 13:44:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Avatar\" director, who uses performance capture to help create fantasy characters, has consistently raised the level of movie visual effects. But James Cameron believes using artificial intelligence to create a character and performance without an actor is \"horrifying.\"",
    "story": [
      "Much of what we see from the Earth-like moon of Pandora, the fantastical setting for the \"Avatar\" franchise, comes from a soundstage in Los Angeles, where scenes from the second and third movies were filmed. \"We had to build an ocean,\" director James Cameron said. \"We could make a two-meter swell. We could make a wave crash up on a shoreline if we built the shoreline.\"",
      "Sigourney Weaver, Zoe Salda\u00f1a  and other actors shot their underwater scenes in the nearly 250,000-gallon tank. Digital artists then took those shots, called performance captures, as a template to render the final versions of the characters we see on screen.",
      "\"So, performance capture, we use a whole bunch of cameras to capture the body performance of the actor,\" Cameron explained. \"And we use a single camera (or now we use actually two) to video their face. They're in a close-up 100% of the time. But there's a beautiful thing about being in a close-up 100% of the time. It's very much like theater rehearsal.\"",
      "\"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" is the third film in the series. It tells the story of the indigenous Na'vis' fight to defend their paradise from colonizing humans.",
      "Cameron created these stories and this world. He's always been a dreamer, even as a kid in rural Canada. \"I lived in a world of my imagination \u2013 it was comic books, it was science fiction. I read a lot. There were movies, TV shows,\" he said. \"I mean, I had a pretty fertile imagination.\"",
      "Cameron moved to Los Angeles with his parents as a teen. He briefly attended community college, where studies included marine biology, before dropping out and picking up odd jobs, including truck driving.",
      "So, how did he go from blue collar to Hollywood? \"Watching 'Star Wars,'\" he said. \"I used to put my headphones on and listen to fast electronic music and imagine space battles, hyperkinetic space battles with all kinds of maneuvers and energy weapons, and people going through debris fields and all that. If the things I'm seeing in my mind can be the same things that are in a movie that's the number one movie in movie history, then I've got a salable imagination.\"",
      "He returned to school, although not in an official capacity. \"I started to study visual effects, and the way I did it was, I didn't have the money to go to USC or anything like that. So what I used to do is, I'd go down to USC, I'd go bury myself on a Saturday, when I wasn't driving a truck, in the stacks. And I'd read everything I could find on optical printing and front-screen projection and, you know, sodium process traveling mattes. All self-taught. I'd Xerox all these scholarly papers, put them all in binders. And I had this shelf full of black binders that had essentially a graduate course in visual effects and cinematography.\"",
      "He found jobs in visual effects departments and production design, rising through the ranks quickly due to his technical knowledge.",
      "Then, in the early 1980s, Cameron, inspired by a literal dream about a robot exoskeleton, co-wrote and directed \"The Terminator.\" The movie put him on the map, and proved he could turn his imagination into reality.",
      "But CGI wasn't available at the time; the effects were done largely through puppeteering. \"We just figured out how to do it all practically,\" Cameron said.",
      "He showed us around his private museum in Los Angeles, full of movie props from his films, including \"Aliens,\" where puppeteers brought Sigourney Weaver's powerlifter - and the Alien Queen \u2013 to life. Of the Alien Queen, Cameron said, \"Her head had, I think, seven or eight different axes of movement that were controlled by cables that went basically out her butt. And we had to hide all that stuff, so there was a lotta steam and smoke and backlight and things like that.\"",
      "Cameron's first use of CGI came with the science fiction movie \"The Abyss,\" It was also his first cinematic foray into another one of his fascinations: the deep sea. His second venture into an oceanic film? \"Titanic.\" It became the then-highest-grossing movie of all time. Cameron took home three Oscars himself.",
      "But the film itself was never the priority for Cameron: He said he wrote the script in order to explore the wreck of the Titanic. \"It was a little bit of a means to an end, you know?\" he said. \"I thought, 'I can just go do this. All right, I need a story. Okay, 'Romeo and Juliet.' You know, young, doomed love on the Titanic.' Boom! Like, instantaneous.\"",
      "He found a way to use Hollywood to invest in his passion for scientific exploration. \"Yeah, exactly,\" he said. \"And then I had so much fun on my expedition that was to shoot Titanic for the movie, that I basically took an eight-year hiatus from Hollywood, an eight-year sabbatical. And I did subsequently six more expeditions for a total of seven, before I started 'Avatar.'\"",
      "Cameron wrote the treatment for \"Avatar\" before \"Titanic,\" but it wasn't until 2005 that he thought the current technology could support his vision. And even then, he wasn't sure the business of Hollywood would go along. \"For years, there was this sense that, 'Oh, they're doing something strange with computers and they're replacing actors,' when in fact, once you really drill down and you see what we're doing, it's a celebration of the actor-director moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Now, go to the other end of the spectrum, and you've got generative AI, where they can make up a character,\" he continued. \"They can make up an actor. They can make up a performance from scratch with a text prompt. It's like, no. That's horrifying to me. That's the opposite. That's exactly what we're not doing.\"",
      "Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" opens next months.",
      "So, how does he feel a few weeks from the premiere? \"Nervous!\" he laughed. \"Are you kidding? Always. Always.\"",
      "Despite the uncertainty, Cameron is still undaunted, and enamored by the unknown. \"I'm attracted, in case you haven't noticed, by things I don't know how to do,\" he said. \"Because you grow and you learn. If I'm still making movies when I got an oxygen tube up my nose and I'm 87 or whatever, should I be that lucky, I want to still be doing things I don't know how to do.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Nov 2025 10:03:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The heavy metal band has not only changed lives with their music; they've also changed lives with their philanthropy \u2013 from donations to food banks and disaster relief, to their charity, All Within My Hands, which has donated to workforce education and other critical services.",
    "story": [
      "Carmen DeBerry is a newly-minted commercial delivery driver in Baltimore, Maryland. She says having this new job has completely changed her life. \"It feels awesome,\" she said. \"You know, I take care of my daughter, and I also take care of my mother.\"",
      "The commercial driver's license, like the type DeBerry got at the Community College of Baltimore County, can cost up to $7,500, money she didn't have \u2013 which is where four kind of unlikely guys from the Bay Area stepped in.",
      "Yes, we are talking about the guys from the band Metallica, one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, with more than 180 million records sold. \"I mean, to be honest, I didn't know when I first signed up that it was through Metallica; they just called it a scholarship,\" DeBerry said.",
      "A Metallica Scholarship, to be precise, part of the more than $10 million the band's charity All Within My Hands has donated to workforce education, mostly in the form of grants through trade schools and community colleges.",
      "\"Not everyone is built for college, and not everyone needs college,\" said Metallica lead singer James Hetfield. And he should know; he himself is the son of a truck driver, something he's hasn't forgotten.",
      "\"It was very evident during COVID, you know, when we weren't able to go out and do our thing,\" said Hetfield. \"But the plumber, the electrician, the truck driver, the people that needed to help keep America running were there. And thank God for them. You know, my thought is that the next millionaires will be the tradesmen.\"",
      "\"We all came from, I mean, pretty humble beginnings,\" said Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, who worked in construction before he became a professional musician. \"At a certain point you realize, like, hey, you know, we're selling tickets, we're doing well, the ship's not sinking. What can we do to make people's lives better?\"",
      "The band's philanthropy actually began with the simple question of what to do with their leftover food backstage at the sports arenas and stadiums they'd been playing. They started donating it to local food banks; then, they starting donating sizable checks to those food banks as well, which turned into disaster relief.",
      "\"It was a bit profound for us because one of the first things that happened was in, maybe 2017, we had the Northern California fires that affected so many people in the Bay Area,\" said guitarist Kirk Hammett. When disaster struck in the band's backyard, that's when he says it hit home: \"And we were able to, like, jump in and, like, really help people right off the bat. And there's been other instances where there's been earthquakes, you know, disasters, people in need of food and medicine. And we've been able to step up and send money, and not just a pittance, but like enough money that makes a difference to, you know, a good group of people who need it.\"",
      "But actually talking about their charity work publicly? That didn't come as easily, says drummer Lars Ulrich. \"We had never screamed from the rooftops about it,\" he said. \"I think instinctively you just want to help. I mean, we all depend on each other \u2013 you know, if you really want to break it down, then you go, humans are herd animals and really thrive, you know, the flock does better when everybody is doing well.\"",
      "Now, if all this doesn't sound very Metallica-like, well, in a way neither does the annual fundraiser concert that they've been putting on in Los Angeles. Last year it raised $3.5 million and brought in some big Metallica admirers, like Aquaman himself Jason Momoa. \"They've kind of been the soundtrack of my life, man. I've kind of discovered them probably when I was ten years old. And I think these are your heroes. These are my heroes.\"",
      "It might come as a surprise to some that a band with songs like \"Nothing Else Matters\" and \"Seek and Destroy\" spends so much time thinking about how to better other people's lives. But for Hetfield, it's a thought process that comes with age.",
      "\"It seems clearer that we have a purpose,\" he said. \"And that purpose is to bring joy to people on this planet, and absolutely still blows my mind that there's three generations out there, you know, rocking out to 'Master of Puppets.' Like, really? You like this song? Okay! That was written when I was 22 years old, and I was pissed off. But beyond what we've done in the music thing, as you get older, you start to see the world in a different light, you know? My philosophy is, you're climbing to the next layer of the high rise. And the older you get, the better the view is of the world, and what you get to see, and where you can be of service. And this is certainly one of them.\"",
      "Up until now, Hetfield had never actually met a Metallica scholar, but that changed backstage before a show in Landover, Maryland, when a very appreciative Carmen DeBerry stopped by. \"I really think that your scholarship, me telling them about your scholarship, is what got me the job,\" she told Hetfield. \"Because once I told them that I got the Metallica scholarship, they were like, Whaaaaat? I got an entrance, and they took a chance with me. And I appreciate it.\"",
      "\"Right on!\" Hetfield replied.",
      "I asked, \"You're about to go out and play to thousands and thousands of people, and yet you just had a moment of getting to talk to somebody whose life has been significantly changed from All Within My Hands' charity work. What's that feel like?\"",
      "Hetfield replied, \"It is so amazing. We get to go make some people smile out there, deliver the goods by playing songs that saved us in our lives. And then to create a foundation that's giving back to, you know, the blue collar America? We get to go from thousands that are making big noise, that we know we're impacting, but to get a one-on-one, you know, heart-to-heart with somebody whose life you've changed, it changes mine.\"",

    "summary": "From living on her Upstate New York farm, to her roles in movies like the forthcoming \"The Testament of Ann Lee\" and \"The Housemaid,\" to her battling serious anxiety and OCD, the Oscar-nominee reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
    "story": [
      "Breakfast is served on Amanda Seyfried's Upstate New York farm, which means feeding the horses, the goats, and Cliff, a 35-year-old pony. \"I love it,\" Seyfried said, \"'cause nothing else matters, because they need to get fed. It's a responsibility that, like, keeps me focused on what's important.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it about this place that makes you feel whatever it is that it makes you feel?\"",
      "\"I don't know if you know this, but Hollywood is really \u2026 it's tricky, and it's got a lot of personalities,\" Seyfried replied. \"There are a lot of people that are working in a way that doesn't necessarily make it feel like a safe place. This is exactly what I have always wanted.\"",
      "And she's is not merely putting on a show for the cameras. \"Last night it was raining, it was pouring, and I was doing the same ****. I just didn't look this nice!\" she said.",
      "This is where Seyfried lives, but she goes where the work is, and there's been plenty of it \u2013 as Karen, memorably clueless in \"Mean Girls,\" later as Sophie in the mega-hit \"Mamma Mia!\"",
      "A big change of pace came in 2020, starring as early Hollywood actress Marion Davies in \"Mank.\" The film earned Seyfried an Oscar nomination.",
      "She agrees that she wants to be challenged, badly. \"Because here's the thing: the challenge is within a certain parameter. I have had enough therapy and enough insight and perspective to know what happens when I may fall too deep into something, and I have enough tools and support to not let that happen. So, every time I'd say it's a challenge, it's really hard, and I look back and I'm like, I wouldn't want to do that again! But when I'm in it, it's more than a challenge; it's a new life. I'm being born into something \u2013 a new version of myself.\"",
      "Her commitment is right there on the screen in two movies out next month: the psychological thriller \"The Housemaid,\" co-starring Sydney Sweeney; and the dramatic musical \"The Testament of Ann Lee.\"",
      "In that 18th century story, Seyfried plays Ann Lee, the founder of the Shakers, a religious sect that embraced equality and chastity, even inside of marriage.",
      "\"Her conviction was everything,\" Seyfried said of Lee. \"The coolest thing about her is that she created a utopia. The idea that we're better off working together as equals, it still rings true to this day. Like, if you take away power and control of each other, there's nothing we can't do.\"",
      "The cast received a long standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, while the role has made Seyfried an Oscar contender.",
      "\"It's like, I worked my ass off in this specific experience, and I worked my ass off throughout my career, and I've stayed true to who I am,\" she said. \"I've definitely changed, and evolved, and become a better person. Do I still make mistakes? Uh-huh, yeah. Do I still make bad choices? Yeah! But I'm human, and I'm, like, doing the best I can. And I'm nice. And I'm f****** nice!\" she laughed. \"'Cause there's no other reason not to be.\"",
      "I can testify, she is \u2026 nice! And refreshingly honest. Raised in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Seyfried studied acting and music as a kid, did some modeling, too. In high school, she was a regular on the soap opera \"All My Children.\" She was on the show for ten months.",
      "Why'd she leave it? \"Why did I leave? Why did Megan McTavish write me off? I don't know, ask her!\" she laughed.",
      "Getting fired, even at 17, hurt. She figured acting was over, so she enrolled at New York's Fordham University, sort of. \"I, like, took the elevator up, and then I stood there, looked at the elevators, and then I took the escalator down, and then I went home. That was my time at Fordham,\" she laughed.",
      "Immediately after \"college,\" Seyfried landed an audition for \"Mean Girls,\" her first big break. \"Mamma Mia!\" was her second. It led to a sequel, 2018's \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\" \u2026 and maybe a trilogy? Asked if there was going to be a third one, she replied, \"Yeah, absolutely.\"",
      "\"Do we know anything about the story?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I think if we all decided we'll do it for free, they'll be like, 'Cool. Let's do it tomorrow,'\" she replied. \"I know Judy Craymer, who created it, is working furiously on a script. I just assume it'll happen exactly ten years from when we shot the last one, which was '17. So, we'll shoot it in 2027, out in 2028. Every ten years! I just don't know how they get Meryl back.\"",
      "Well, that is the tricky part, as her character is (spoiler) dead. Evil twin? \"There it is!\" Seyfried smiled.",
      "Some character traits can stay with Seyfried, like the voice of Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder convicted of fraud in \"The Dropout\" (2022). The role won Seyfried an Emmy.",
      "Seyfried is candid about everything, including battling serious anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, obstacles she believes help her as an actor. \u00a0\"All the things that I have, I've been diagnosed with, I've been able to channel them in the right ways and take the right medication to use it to my advantage,\" she said, \"and to, like, shut it up when it's no longer helpful, for the most part. And that has helped me. Self-loathing, self-judgment, all that, at times helped me keep my s*** together.\"",
      "Seyfried, who turns 40 this week, is married to actor Thomas Sadowski. They have two children. Her daughter was close by during our conversation, as was a guitar. It's one of many instruments Seyfried  plays.",
      "She was looking right at her daughter as she sang.",
      "Seeing her in own house, this farm upstate, surrounded by family and animals, reveals a grounded movie star living a grounded life.",
      "\"It's my world now,\" she said. \"Like, I've been in it for 25 years or whatever. And I, like, totally feel at home in it. And people know me well enough, I don't feel like I have anything to prove. I'm nice to people. I'm not trying to cover up any scandals \u2013 yet! Wait! \u2013 and I'm not trying to, you know, hide or, like, run away from any bad press. So it's like, I've made it easy for myself. So far!\"",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Nov 2025 20:58:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation.",
    "story": [
      "British playwright Tom Stoppard, who won an Academy Award for the screenplay for 1998's \"Shakespeare In Love,\" has died. He was 88.",
      "United Agents said in a statement Saturday that Stoppard died \"peacefully\" at his home in Dorset in southern England, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"He will be remembered for his works, for their brilliance and humanity, and for his wit, his irreverence, his generosity of spirit and his profound love of the English language. It was an honour to work with Tom and to know him,\" the statement said.",
      "\"My wife and I are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of our greatest writers, Sir Tom Stoppard,\" King Charles said in a statement. \"A dear friend who wore his genius lightly, he could, and did, turn his pen to any subject, challenging, moving and inspiring his audiences, borne from his own personal history. We send our most heartfelt sympathy to his beloved family. Let us all take comfort in his immortal line: \"Look on every exit as being an entrance somewhere else.\"",
      "Stoppard was born in the Czech Republic in 1937. His family fled to Singapore after Nazi Germany's invasion in 1939. He, his brother and their mother fled again when Japanese forces closed in on the city in 1941. His father died trying to leave the city. His mother married an English officer in 1946, and the family moved to postwar Britain. The 8-year-old Tom \"put on Englishness like a coat,\" he later said, growing up to be a quintessential Englishman who loved cricket and Shakespeare.",
      "Stoppard first worked as a journalist before turning to theater in the 1960s. Stoppard was often hailed as the greatest British playwright of his generation and was garlanded with honors, including a shelf full of theater gongs.",
      "His brain-teasing plays ranged across Shakespeare, science, philosophy and the historic tragedies of the 20th century. Five of them won Tony Awards for best play: \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\" in 1968; \"Travesties\" in 1976; \"The Real Thing\" in 1984; \"The Coast of Utopia\" in 2007; and \"Leopoldstadt\" in 2023.",
      "He wrote plays for radio and television including \"A Walk on the Water,\" televised in 1963, and made his stage breakthrough with \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\" which reimagined Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" from the viewpoint of two hapless minor characters.",
      "Stoppard was a strong champion of free speech who worked with organizations including PEN\u00a0and Index on Censorship. He claimed not to have strong political views otherwise, writing in 1968: \"I burn with no causes. I cannot say that I write with any social objective. One writes because one loves writing, really.\"",
      "That was especially true of his late play \"Leopoldstadt,\" which drew on his own family's story for the tale of a Jewish Viennese family over the first half of the 20th century. Stoppard said he began thinking of his personal link to the Holocaust quite late in life, only discovering after his mother's death in 1996 that many members of his family, including all four grandparents, had died in concentration camps.",
      "\"Leopoldstadt\" premiered in London at the start of 2020 to rave reviews; weeks later all theaters were shut by the COVID-19 pandemic. It eventually opened on Broadway in late 2022, going on to win four Tonys.",
      "Dizzyingly prolific, Stoppard also wrote many radio plays, a novel, television series including \"Parade's End\" (2013) and many film screenplays. These included dystopian Terry Gilliam comedy \"Brazil\" (1985), Steven Spielberg-directed war drama \"Empire of the Sun\" (1987), Elizabethan romcom \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998) \u2014 for which he and Marc Norman shared a best adapted screenplay Oscar \u2014 code breaking thriller \"Enigma\" (2001) and Russian epic \"Anna Karenina\" (2012).",
      "He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1997 for his services to literature.",

      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "story": [
      "If buying a home today is\u00a0financially out of reach\u00a0for many Americans, affording the rent may also seem like an increasingly tall order.",
      "In the 50 largest U.S. cities, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment climbed an average of $457 per month, or 41%, to $1,578\u00a0between 2020 and 2025, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0from loan marketplace LendingTree. Two-bedroom rents have surged an average of $505, or 37%, to roughly $1,858 per month over the same period.",
      "Since 2019, rents nationally have risen\u00a01.5 times faster than wages on average, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from online real estate brokers Zillow and StreetEasy.",
      "\"If your income is rising at the same time your rent is, maybe that extra expense is no big deal,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in the report. \"However, so many Americans' financial wiggle room is tiny, even in the best of times, so having to carve out hundreds of extra dollars to pay rent each month can be a big deal.\"",
      "Several factors explain why rents have surged, said Rob Bhatt, a consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. Perhaps most importantly, during the pandemic legions of newly remote workers moved to new markets, driving up rent\u00a0and housing prices.",
      "\"All the things that we saw during the pandemic have created stresses on the system, including stresses in these markets that traditionally haven't been renters' markets, and so it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust,\" he told CBS News.",
      "High home prices and rising mortgage rates, which have kept a lid on the number of homes coming to market, have also left more renters competing for a limited stock of affordable housing. Rents are projected to ease nationally next year, but only by 1%, according to a recent study from Realtor.com.",
      "Where have rents risen the most?",
      "New York, San Diego and Miami have seen the largest monthly rental increases for both one-bedroom units \u2014 which rose $854, $817 and $764 in the three cities, respectively, since 2020 \u2014 and two-bedroom units, which have jumped $857, $877 and $885, respectively, over the last five years.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 cities where one-bedroom rents have risen the most over the last five years, according to LendingTree (see chart below for a listing of the change in rents for the top 50 cities):",

      "In New York and San Diego, the spike in rents is attributable mostly to the demand for housing exceeding supply, according to LendingTree. Renters in those metro areas face limited inventory and plenty of competition.",
      "LendingTree attributed the surge in rental prices in Miami to the local population boom, noting that strong domestic and international migration to the area has driven up demand.",
      "One high-priced city where rent increases have cooled is San Francisco. The cost of a one-bedroom unit in the city rose $54 a month, to an average of $2,977, over the last five years, while two-bedrooms rose $51 to $3,604, LendingTree found.",
      "Other cities where rents are growing more slowly are Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; San Antonio, Texas; and St. Louis, Mo.",
      "LendingTree's findings are based on an analysis of fair-market rents (FMR) from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The federal agency defines such rents as \"estimates of 40th percentile gross rents for standard-quality units within a metropolitan area or nonmetropolitan county.\" The firm's figures exclude rents for public housing and for units built within the past two years.",

DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year.",

      "Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor.",
      "Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New\u00a0data from payroll firm ADP\u00a0shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Zillow, another online real estate marketplace, also expects the housing market will ease for homebuyers as inventory grows and mortgage rates tick down. The company projects existing home sales will rise to nearly 4.3 million next year, up 4.3% from its projected total for 2025. Mortgage rates are likely to hover just above 6%, according to Zillow \u2014 higher than in recent years, but modest by historical standards.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Trump accounts are a new type of tax-deferred investment vehicle for U.S. children, created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill, which promises $1,000 seed contributions from the federal government for eligible kids.",

      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage",
      "Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17",
      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "The government's initial starter deposit is an appealing feature of Trump accounts, according to experts. Beyond the seed money, however, they offer fewer benefits than other savings plans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\"A simpler approach would consolidate today's patchwork of savings accounts into universal savings accounts that are flexible, tax-neutral and easier for families to use,\" the policy research group added in a report.",
      "To save money for college, a 529 plan, which lets families sock away money for education expenses tax-free, could be a better alternative, investment experts said. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering account holders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "summary": "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, tells \"CBS Mornings\" that parents have every right to select the qualities and traits they desire in their child.",
    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

The Dells said they are encouraging others to join in by contributing funds to the accounts, ranging from other philanthropists and businesses to childrens' families and friends.",
      "\"We believe the smartest investment we can make is the one in children,\" Michael Dell told \"CBS News 24/7 Mornings\" in a Tuesday interview. \"We know that when a child has an account like this, even a modest sum, it really improves their outlook on life, and they are more likely to graduate from high school and college, and buy a home, start a business, start a family, become productive members of society.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Anna Paulina Luna on Tuesday followed through on a monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bipartisan bill that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, introduced a discharge petition to circumvent House leaders and put the measure on the floor for a vote if it receives 218 signatures. The procedural maneuver has become a common tactic for rank-and-file lawmakers to try to force a vote on issues ignored by Republican leaders.",
      "The congresswoman had threatened to file a discharge petition if there wasn't movement on the Restore Trust in Congress Act by the end of September. But the push for a vote was stalled by the 43-day government shutdown that began on Oct. 1. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, kept the House out of session during the shutdown, putting all committee hearings and markups of legislation on hiatus.",
      "Dozens of House lawmakers across the political spectrum have coalesced behind the Restore Trust in Congress Act, which would prohibit members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The compromise bill was introduced by Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in September and has the support of more than 100 members, including progressives, conservatives and moderate Republicans and Democrats.",
      "But the bill is also facing bipartisan opposition, according to its cosponsors, who spoke to reporters ahead of a Nov. 19 hearing before the House Administration Committee about congressional stock trading.",
      "\"There are members in both parties who do not want this to happen, who are in the ear of leadership, who are trying to stop this from happening,\" Democratic Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island said.",
      "Under a 13-year-old law known as the STOCK Act, members of Congress, executive branch officials and other federal employees are prohibited from using nonpublic information for their financial benefit. The law also requires officials to disclose stock trades exceeding $1,000 within 45 days.",

    "summary": "Flyers without Real IDs, passports or other accepted forms of identification will need to pay a $45 fee starting Feb. 1.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. air travelers who haven't upgraded to a Real ID can still fly without one, but starting Feb. 1 they'll be charged a $45 fee, the Transportation Security Administration\u00a0said\u00a0Monday.",
      "Flyers without a Real ID, a passport or another acceptable form of ID will need to have their identities confirmed through a fee-based verification system called TSA Confirm.ID, the agency said.",
      "The announcement of a $45 fee for people without Real IDs comes after the TSA started requiring the identification or other approved documents in May. The Real ID is a federally compliant state driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card, identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner.",
      "Passengers without Real IDs \"will be referred to the optional TSA Confirm.ID process for identity verification upon TSA check-in and prior to entering the security line,\" the TSA said.",
      "The process will vary from airport to airport, according to the agency, which said it is working with private vendors to allow consumers to pay for the screening process before they arrive at the airport. The TSA warned that people without Real IDs could encounter increased wait times at airports while their identities are verified.",
      "The fee verifies passengers for a 10-day period, according to the TSA. The agency is still urging passengers without Real IDs to visit their local DMV to update their IDs.",
      "The $45 fee is designed to ensure that travelers, not taxpayers, foot the bill for the advanced verification system, said Adam Stahl, a TSA official, in the statement.",
      "Some travel experts said the new fee disadvantages lower-income Americans and that the 10-day verification window could cause confusion.",
      "The policy creates \"a bizarre situation where your identity expires like a carton of milk,\" travel expert Julian Kheel, founder of flight search engine Points Path, told CBS News. \"After those 10 days pass, you're back to square one, forced to pay another $45 even though nothing about your actual identity has changed.\"",
      "How does Confirm.ID work?",
      "Confirm.ID asks passengers without Real IDs to answer a series of questions about themselves to verify their identity.",
      "Once a passenger's identity is confirmed, they'll receive a receipt to show a screening agent at the TSA checkpoint, along with their form of ID. They will then continue through security like all other passengers.",
      "Passengers who don't have Real IDs and opt not to pay the $45 fee may be denied entry at checkpoints, the TSA said Monday during a press call describing the new fee-based program.",
      "What's an acceptable form of ID?",
      "Travelers with Real IDs or other accepted forms of identification don't have to pay the $45 fee to travel. Here are some of the documents the TSA says can substitute for a Real-ID-compliant driver's license:",

      "The TSA's website has a\u00a0complete list of compliant types of IDs.",
      "Who has a Real ID?",
      "The TSA noted that more than 94% of passengers currently use Real IDs or other acceptable forms of identification.",
      "The TSA had previously proposed a rule that would charge travelers without a Real ID an $18 fee at security checkpoints, according to a\u00a0notice\u00a0published in the Federal Register earlier this month.",
      "The cost of getting a Real ID varies by state. New York, for example, has no additional fee for a Real ID beyond the regular cost of getting a driver's license or renewing it, but\u00a0Pennsylvania\u00a0charges a \"one-time $30 Real ID fee\" on top of standard renewal fees.",

    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 14:08:34 -0500",
    "summary": "Personal finance is too complex for most people to navigate, two economists contend in a new book. Is there a better way to help people deal with money?",
    "story": [
      "Americans typically score poorly in financial literacy tests. Yet they're on their own when it comes to making major financial decisions, from funding their retirement to buying a home, two economists argue in a new book that critiques the personal finance system.",
      "Take the U.S. retirement system, which has shifted away from corporate-based pensions that guaranteed income in old age toward 401(k) plans, where workers must decide how to invest their savings.",
      "In theory, taking control of your investment decisions should be empowering, but the current U.S. retirement system \"appears too complex for many people to understand,\" write Harvard University economist John Campbell and Imperial College London economist Tarun Ramadorai in \"Fixed: Why Personal Finance Is Broken and How to Make It Work for Everyone,\" published by Princeton University Press.",
      "Despite some recent changes in how personal finance is practiced in the U.S., such as automatic enrollment in 401(k)s that were inspired by behavioral economist Richard Thaler's research about \"nudges\" \u2014 small changes that can steer people to make positive financial decisions \u2014 millions of Americans remain woefully unprepared to weather the financial strains of old age.",
      "Stronger medicine is needed, Campbell and Ramadorai say. Rather than a nudge, they call for a combination of regulatory and industry changes designed to overhaul the country's approach to personal finance \u2014 a broader shift they describe as a \"shove.\"",
      "\"We've learned that people make many mistakes, and particularly, sadly, less educated and poorer people tend to make worse mistakes,\" Campbell told CBS News.",
      "Their book proposes a \"starter kit\" of personal finance options, such as retirement accounts that automatically enroll people when they start their first job and stay with them throughout their careers, along with savings accounts that pay interest at the same rate and carry clear, transparent fees.",
      "CBS News spoke with Campbell and Ramdorai about their new book. It has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "CBS News: You write that most Americans are financially illiterate, according to one\u00a0basic assessment. Yet you say that introducing personal finance classes in high school isn't the solution. Why?",
      "Campbell: A simple way to put it is that you have a race between financial literacy and the complexity of the products people are offered, and the decisions they're asked to make. And complexity has been winning the race.",
      "Yes, young people in high school do have to make some big decisions \u2014 taking on student debt, going to college. They may also get a credit card, and then they have to manage their credit score. But there are a lot of other decisions they won't make until much later in life.",
      "It's as if we were trying to teach people to drive by just having the classroom component of driver's ed, without putting the kids behind the wheel.",
      "Ramadorai: All of us are also consumers in the personal finance system, and if you ask me what fraction of my daily time I spend thinking about my own personal finance situation, it's probably fairly small. But the financial sector is entirely focused \u2014 especially those on the personal finance side \u2014 on trying to get this right. So there's a sort of uneven competition between me, however educated I may be, and the financial sector, who is doing this on an industrial scale.",
      "For us to say, \"Oh, well, you know, if only you had taken the time and trouble to be educated, you wouldn't be in the situation you're in right now,\" that seems a bit glib. We're proposing not just putting all of the burden of responsibility on individuals.",
      "You advocate for \"shoves\" instead of \"nudges\" to ensure people are on the proper financial path. Can you elaborate?",
      "Ramadorai: We've seen lots of good examples of these nudges \u2014 for example, auto-enrollment into pension plans. That seems like it's a very well-functioning, effective policy until you start to look a little bit more closely at it. Research is starting to emerge that, in some cases, what happens is that the default contribution rate can actually either be too high or too low, depending on what kind of person you are.",
      "There's a kind of characterization or a caricature of academics as, \"All you want is, you just want the government to come in and fix everything.\" That's really not what we're about in this book.",
      "What we're trying to say is that we believe very strongly in the power of capitalism to produce products that are extremely high quality and are delivered at very low prices. But the energy of capitalism has been perverted.",
      "Campbell: We'd like to make personal finance shopping more like buying a painkiller when you have a headache. You know, you walk into the pharmacy, you go to the shelf. There's ibuprofen, there's Advil, there's the generic \u2014 it's all on the same shelf. The active ingredient is the same, the dosage is the same, and there's a little label on the shelf that shows you the price per unit.",
      "We think personal finance, unfortunately, is a long way away from that right now. It's more like the world of unregulated medicine 120 years ago, when people were selling legitimate medicines, but they were also selling snake oil, and it was very hard for individuals to tell the difference.",
      "You're suggesting that personal finance should be more tightly regulated. Critics of that idea might argue that this would chill innovation in personal finance. What's your view?",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0There are areas where even the most laissez-faire among us would agree that there's a role for government intervention. Think about civil aviation.",
      "Civil aviation transports very large numbers of people across vast distances at a relatively low cost, and what we don't necessarily want is for people to come in and innovate in that space in a way that introduces risks, because we're super averse to the fact that we don't want these things falling out of the sky.",
      "The other one, of course, is basic utilities. You want the lights to be on \u2014 electricity companies are regulated in a particular way, there's piping that goes to houses for running water. We think that there's a strong role for government to play in having regulation in those areas.",
      "Our argument is that there are vast areas of personal finance that are just as important as any of those basic utilities. It is the plumbing that makes our financial system work.",
      "Campbell: We instead propose a forward-looking, design-focused approach to regulation, where we ask the regulators to get very specific about what a basic financial product should look like. We call these \"starter kit products.\" They can offer a wide range of products. And the starter kit product should be designed so that it is simple, safe, cheap and easy.",
      "If you could redesign how personal finance works in the U.S. from the ground up, what would be the first feature you would build in?",
      "Campbell:\u00a0Number one, I would create a universal retirement account. I would give it a Roth structure that is open for people, automatically upon the date of first employment, and then you can carry it with you across all jobs that you have subsequently.",
      "That would fix the problem we have at the moment \u2014 we have this immense profusion of accounts, and as people change jobs, they very often end up with multiple 401(k)s. But at the same time, people who work for small businesses or who are self-employed \u2014 maybe they open an IRA, maybe they don't \u2014 but the contribution limits are much lower, and so we have an access problem.",
      "Ramadorai:\u00a0Right now in the United States, there's a lock-in problem [with mortgages], which is that interest rates have gone up so high that it's compromising mobility for most people in the U.S. So people are sitting on 2% mortgages, and they're absolutely reluctant to move, even if there's a great job opportunity somewhere else, because they would have to refinance into a much higher rate.",
      "There's a feature of mortgage markets that exists in other places, which is called portability, where you simply take your old mortgage with you to the new place \u2014 you then get the lender to reassess the collateral on the new place, and then you're able to take your mortgage with you. That increases mobility and keeps the labor market functioning well.",
      "You could also have a different feature, which is called assumability, where the buyer of your house actually is able to take on your cheap mortgage, assuming that they pass the appropriate credit checks and so on.",
      "Both of those features, portability and assumability, would be really good additions to the U.S. mortgage market.",

    "summary": "Relief will take time, because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
    "story": [
      "As one of America's coffee capitals, Portland, Oregon, has grounds for worry: coffee prices have soared to historic highs.",
      "\"We have bags of coffee on our menu that are $28.50. That's a lot of money for a bag of coffee,\" said Laila Ghambari, owner of Guilder Coffee Company, a caf\u00e9 that sells specialty coffee.",
      "Ghambari and her brothers practically grew up inside an espresso machine. Her father owned a coffee shop, and Ghambari became the U.S. barista champion in 2014. Now, she's a small business owner grappling with the expense of tariffs, which are still impacting her business even though coffee and other products were granted an exemption last month.",
      "\"Any coffee that's already landed in the United States is still subject to the tariff,\" Ghambari said.",
      "Coffee prices were already high due to supply and demand pressures for premium beans along with climate issues, especially crop-killing frost. The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee hit a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, according to\u00a0the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In December 2019, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic, one pound of ground coffee cost a little over $4. And in August, retail coffee prices in the U.S. had jumped 20.9% from the previous year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 the sharpest increase in nearly three decades.",
      "Then, back in April, the U.S. imposed a so-called reciprocal tariff of 10% on coffee-producing countries. Ghambari said it cost her roughly fifty cents a bag.",
      "Christopher Hendon, a chemistry professor at the University of Oregon   known as \"Dr. Coffee,\" studies the global industry and said the tariffs cost independent coffee operators more than consumers.",
      "\"[The consumer is] probably not feeling it,\" Hendon said. \"You might not care today, because the price didn't change all that much, but you might care if your local caf\u00e9 disappears.\"",
      "Charlie Wicker's company, Trailhead Coffee Roasters, roasts green beans into brown ones. Tariffs hit him hard.",
      "\"I had to lay off the two full-time employees. So now it's down to just myself and one part-time employee,\" Wicker said, adding, \"The fact that we're still standing is a function of having a little bit of savings to keep the lights on.\"",
      "Despite the reversal that lifted tariffs on coffee, relief will take time because coffee roasters and caf\u00e9s typically order beans months in advance.",
      "Ghambari said it won't be until February when the first import of tariff-free coffees will land in her warehouse.",
      "For Wicker, who delivers to caf\u00e9s, lifting those tariffs could be the coffee break he needs.",

      "Newell Brands, the maker of Sharpie and Yankee Candle, said Monday it is laying off more than 900 workers, or about 10% of its workforce, as the company seeks to cut costs.",
      "Newell also\u00a0said in a statement that it will close roughly 20 Yankee Candle stores across the U.S. and Canada early next year as part of its cost-cutting plan. The layoffs are set to begin this month, according to the Atlanta-based company. Newell's other brands include Mr. Coffee, Oster, Rubbermaid and Sunbeam.",
      "The publicly listed company, whose shares have fallen nearly 62% this year amid slowing growth, launched a turnaround plan in 2023 as it tries to boost sales. The company has also said it will increase its use of automation and artificial intelligence to boost productivity.",
      "\"We've made meaningful progress executing our strategy and strengthening Newell Brands, but there is more work to do,\" Newell Brands president and CEO Chris Peterson said in a statement. \"This productivity plan is about taking the next, disciplined step to enhance efficiency, sharpen our strategic focus, and deliver stronger, more consistent performance.\"",
      "In October, Newell reported third-quarter net sales of $1.8 billion, down 7.2% from the year-ago period. Net income for the quarter rose to $21 million, compared with a net loss of $198 million in the year-ago period.",
      "Newell did not disclose which Yankee Candle stores will close in January of 2026, but said the move \"aligns the brand's footprint with modern consumer shopping behaviors.\"",
      "The company expects to take a charge of up to $90 million to complete the layoffs and store closures, mostly for severance costs. Over the longer term, the plan is expected to generate cost savings of up to $130 million.",

    "published": "Mon, 01 Dec 2025 15:43:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Holiday spending is hitting new records, but some data shows that people are buying fewer items amid higher prices.",
    "story": [
      "Americans may not be feeling jolly about their economic prospects, but that didn't stop shoppers from opening their wallets on Black Friday and driving spending to new records. Despite record holiday sales, however, other signs suggest consumers are getting a smaller bang for their buck because of rising inflation and stingier seasonal discounts.",
      "Consumers spent a combined $11.8 billion online on Nov. 28 during the shopping blitz, a 9.1% jump from last year, Adobe Analytics said. Including in-store sales, Americans spent 4.1% more on Black Friday than a year earlier,\u00a0according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.",
      "Purchases on Cyber Monday are also expected to be strong, with Adobe forecasting shoppers will spend a record $14.2 billion online today, which would amount to a more than 6% jump from a year ago.",
      "The resilience of the American consumer has helped buoy the economy even as it faces headwinds ranging from higher costs from the Trump administration's tariffs to a spike in corporate layoffs amid a slowing labor market.",
      "Inflation remains a problem",
      "Yet while discounts dangled by retailers from Walmart to Amazon helped fuel spending, beneath the record sales are signs of weakness, according to online sales data from Salesforce.com. Discounts this year aren't as deep, with the average selling price of goods rising 7% from a year ago, while consumers bought 2% fewer items at checkout, Salesforce said.",
      "\"A lot of growth is being driven by higher prices, and this means the growth in the number of things that people buy is significantly less,\" Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"So far this year, we have retail volume growth running at about 0.3%, which is very low growth.\"",
      "He added, \"This is one of the reasons some consumers feel a little gloomy when they see their dollars don't stretch as far as they once did.\"",
      "Inflation ticked up to 3% in September on an annual basis, according to the latest available Consumer Price Index data. That's up from a low this year of 2.3% in April.",
      "Experts say tighter household budgets are causing many consumers to watch their spending, such as by focusing on a few \"big ticket\" purchases, or spreading out what they buy over days of promotions in hopes of getting the most bang for their buck.",
      "Affordability pinch",
      "Consumer spending is vital to the U.S. economy because it represents about 70 cents of every $1 of gross domestic product. With consumer confidence falling last month to its lowest point since April, there were questions about whether the holiday season would bring cheer or gloom to retailers.",
      "Some Americans are also facing an affordability pinch, with costs for everything from groceries to utility bills on the rise. According to Deloitte's 2025 holiday study, three-quarters of shoppers reported bracing for higher prices during the holidays.",
      "Consumer spending in 2025 has been largely driven by high-income households, with the top 10% accounting for nearly half of all spending in the second quarter, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of Federal Reserve data by Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Spending among the bottom 80% of households \u2014 or those earning less than $175,000 a year \u2014 has \"simply kept pace with inflation since the pandemic,\" Zandi wrote in a September social media post.",
      "That's creating a so-called\u00a0K-shaped economy, with high-earning Americans spending more, while middle- and low-income households are holding back due to rising costs.",
      "\"Virtually all major holiday outlooks point to a bifurcated consumer,\" Kent Smetters of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research project at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email. \"Widening behavioral gap \u2014 high-income households spending and staying online; lower-income households more selective, financed and volume-conscious.\"",
      "For now, both discount retailers and luxury stores appear to be outperforming this season, Saunders noted.",
      "\"So far, we're seeing value-focused retailers like Walmart and off-price do well,\" he said. \"Some of the accessible luxury brands, such as Coach and Ralph Lauren, are also doing really well. So there are winners out there, but the low-volume growth means that there are losers, too.\"",

    "story": [
      "A long-lost painting by Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens, which was hidden for more than four centuries, sold for $2.7 million at an auction Sunday in Versailles.",
      "The painting was recently found in a private townhouse in Paris. It depicts the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.",
      "It was part of a French collection and was initially thought to be from one of the many Rubens workshops that existed at the time. The artwork was rarely valued at more than $11,500.",
      "\"I immediately had a hunch about this painting, and I did everything I could to try to have it authenticated,\" auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat told The Associated Press. \"And finally, we managed to have it authenticated by the Rubenianum, which is the Rubens committee in Antwerp.\"",
      "Osenat told AFP earlier this year the picture was \"a masterpiece\" which was painted by Rubens when he was \"at the height of his talent.\"",
      "The painting was authenticated by German art historian Nils Buttner, known for his research on the master of the Flemish Baroque, Osenat said. Its provenance was certified through methods including X-ray imaging and pigment analysis, he added.",
      "B\u00fcttner explained before the auction that the master often painted crucifixions but rarely depicted \"the crucified Christ as a dead body on the cross.\"",
      "\"So this is the one and only painting showing blood and water coming out of the side wound of Christ, and this is something that Rubens only painted once.\"",
      "The Osenat auction house said the painting's authenticity and provenance were confirmed after scientific analysis. It said microscopic examination of the paint layers revealed not only white, black, and red pigments in the areas representing flesh, but also blue and green pigments Rubens typically used in painting human skin.",
      "Art expert Eric Turquin told a packed house the painting had virtually disappeared in the early 1600s. It is known to have belonged to 19th-century French classic painter William Bouguereau before it was passed down in the family.",

    "summary": "Texas approved a new congressional map this summer after Trump urged state GOP lawmakers to craft new House district lines to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the 2026 midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday restored for now Texas' newly redrawn congressional map that could give Republicans five additional House seats, after a lower court found that some of the new voting lines were racially discriminatory.",
      "The high court appeared to split 6-3. It said in an unsigned order that it \"has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election,\" and the district court \"violated that rule here.\"",
      "\"The District Court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections,\" the Supreme Court said.",
      "The court wrote that \"based on our preliminary evaluation of this case,\" Texas was likely to succeed on the merits of its arguments that the district court merits committed \"at least two serious errors\" when it found the new map to be an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented from the ruling and said that the lower court had sought to determine whether Texas had accomplished \"its partisan objectives by means of a racial gerrymander enacting an electoral map slanted toward Republicans\" and found that Texas \"largely divided its citizens along racial lines to create its new pro-Republican House map, in violation of the Constitution's Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\"",
      "\"The court issued a 160-page opinion recounting in detail its factual findings,\" Kagan added. \"Yet this Court reverses that judgment based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.\" Kagan was referring here to the Supreme Court's emergency docket, also known as the\u00a0shadow docket. The term refers to the orders and summary decisions issued by the Court without the full briefing and oral argument that accompanies cases on the regular docket.",
      "\"We are a higher court than the District Court, but we are not a better one when it comes to making such a fact-based decision,\" Kagan said.",
      "The decision from the high court is a boon to House Republicans and President Trump \u2014 who has pushed numerous GOP-led states to undertake a rare mid-decade redistricting in an effort to ensure his party holds onto its majority in the House.",
      "That plan was temporarily derailed last month when a divided panel of three judges blocked Texas from using its re-crafted House map for the 2026 election cycle and found that certain districts were racially gerrymandered.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, swiftly asked the Supreme Court to intervene, and Justice Samuel Alito temporarily reinstated the map while the full court considered the request. The high court has now agreed to block the lower court's decision, allowing Texas to use the new district lines for next year's House elections.",
      "Abbott celebrated the high court's decision in a statement, writing: \"We won! Texas is officially\u2014and legally\u2014more red.\"",
      "\"The new congressional districts better align our representation in Washington D.C. with the values of our state,\" the governor said. \"This is a victory for Texas voters, for common sense, and for the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "Texas state House Democratic Leader Rep. Gene Wu said in a statement, \"The Supreme Court failed Texas voters today, and they failed American democracy. This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won't protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face.\"",
      "The move by Texas Republicans to draw new House district lines over the summer kicked off a redistricting fight that has extended to numerous other states. Mr. Trump and White House aides had been pushing GOP lawmakers in Texas to create a new map to bolster Republicans' chances of maintaining their majority in the House, and Abbott called a special session to tackle the issue.",
      "In the wake of that decision, California swiftly moved to redraw its congressional map to net up to five seats for Democrats, offseting the new GOP-leaning seats in Texas. GOP state lawmakers in North Carolina and Missouri have also approved plans that each seek to shift a single Democratic-held seat to the right. Those efforts have also faced legal challenges.",
      "In Texas, six groups of plaintiffs challenged the redrawn House districts and asked a three-judge district court panel to prohibit the state from using the new boundaries in the 2026 elections. The district court divided 2-1 in concluding that Texas racially gerrymandered its map and ordered the state to use for next year's House elections voting boundaries that were enacted by the GOP-led state legislature in 2021.",
      "In an opinion authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that race predominated over politics in the map-making process and that the legislature set and followed a racial target.",
      "\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "Texas officials turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief, arguing that map-makers sought to achieve certain partisan goals to give Republicans a political advantage.",
      "\"This summer, the Texas Legislature did what legislatures do: politics,\" they wrote in a filing. \"It redistricted the State's 38 congressional districts mid-decade to secure five additional Republican seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\"",
      "Texas officials also argued that the district court's injunction came too late \u2014 the filing period for congressional candidates opened 10 days before its decision and ends Dec. 8 \u2014 and disrupted the state's election procedures, risking confusion for candidates and voters. The state invoked a legal principle that generally keeps courts from changing election rules too close to an election in order to avoid confusing voters and election officials.",
      "\"The injunction changes the boundaries of all but one of the State's 38 congressional districts, enjoining Texas from using its duly enacted 2025 map and resurrecting the repealed 2021 map,\" they wrote. \"The chaos caused by such an injunction is obvious: campaigning had already begun, candidates had already gathered signatures and filed applications to appear on the ballot under the 2025 map, and early voting for the March 3, 2026, primary was only 91 days away.\"",
      "The district court's order, Texas officials, said, has \"thrown the election into disarray.\"",
      "But lawyers for the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC, which is the lead plaintiff, said that maintaining the status quo, which is the 2021 map, will prevent voter confusion, while reinstating the latest redistricting plan will force more than 10 million Texas voters into new House districts.",
      "Additionally, they said that keeping the 2021 map in place will allow incumbent lawmakers to campaign in the same districts they were elected to represent in 2024.",
      "\"All candidates for Congress will run in the districts they thought they were running in until 13 weeks ago when the Texas Legislature enacted a new map,\" LULAC lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They argued that race was the predominant factor that drove the map-drawing process this summer, and the legislature targeted multi-racial districts specifically because of their racial composition. LULAC lawyers accused state lawmakers of \"purposefully\" sorting voters on the basis of race to meet racial targets.",
      "The Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to let Texas use its new congressional map for the 2026 election cycle because what's at issue is an \"openly avowed partisan gerrymander.\" The Supreme Court in 2019 said federal courts have no role to play in partisan gerrymandering.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing there is \"overwhelming evidence\" that Texas lawmakers were motivated by partisan objectives.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:25:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved more than one strike, including one that killed survivors of the initial attack.",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The new details about the strike on Sept. 2 have now led some lawmakers to openly question whether the attack on the survivors was a war crime.",
      "Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander who oversaw the Sept. 2 operation,\u00a0briefed small groups of lawmakers on the strikes on Thursday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the classified briefings that Bradley said he had not been ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"kill everybody,\" as was\u00a0reported\u00a0last week by the Washington Post.",
      "But Himes added that the lawmakers were shown video of the second strike, and said that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\" Cotton defended the attack, saying he \"saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "As lawmakers continue to pursue the facts of what occurred on Sept. 2, doubts about the legality of the ongoing campaign against the alleged drug boats persist, with experts and former officials saying the strikes were shaky ground even before the latest revelations.",
      "The boat strikes",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" President Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "Analysis from The Free Press:\u00a0Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in\u00a0a letter\u00a0last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services Committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the intentional killing of survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "The Post reported that a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, a detail that CBS News has not confirmed. Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "After Thursday's briefing, however, Cotton said there had been no change in how the military is treating survivors.",
      "\"There has been no change in the guidance or the order that the secretary has given to our troops,\" the Arkansas Republican said. \"In subsequent strikes, there is an example where survivors actually were shipwrecked and distressed and not trying to continue on their mission, and they were treated as they should be, as noncombatants.\"",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in an interview with CBS News\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",
      "On Thursday evening, U.S. Southern Command announced another strike had killed four in the Eastern Pacific.",

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors on Thursday presented an indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James to a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "Federal grand jurors declined to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James\u00a0on Thursday, a U.S. official said, marking another blow to the government's case after a judge tossed out the Justice Department's bank fraud charges against the Trump foe last week.",
      "The grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia, voted down an indictment after it was presented by federal prosecutors, the official said.",
      "Last week, a judge dismissed charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, was improperly appointed to her role. The judge gave the government the opportunity to re-charge them.",
      "It's extraordinarily rare for grand juries to decline to indict people.",
      "Federal prosecutors investigated more than 150,000 people in the 2016 fiscal year, and in only six cases reported not bringing charges because the grand jury voted down an indictment, according to Justice Department figures.",
      "James thanked the grand jury in a statement Thursday, writing: \"As I have said from the start, the charges against me are baseless. It is time for this unchecked weaponization of our justice system to stop.\"",
      "Her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said the case \"should never have existed in the first place,\" and warned that if the government continues to try to prosecute James, \"it will be a shocking assault on the rule of law and a devastating blow to the integrity of our justice system.\"",
      "The New York attorney general was initially charged in October with bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution. The Justice Department accused James of falsely claiming on mortgage documents that a house she bought in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia, would serve as her second home, when she actually rented it out and used it as an investment property. The government claims she was able to get a more favorable interest rate by calling it a second home.",
      "James has denied wrongdoing and argued the Trump administration is targeting her for political reasons. In between Mr. Trump's terms in the White House, James sued him in civil court for allegedly lying about the value of his real estate assets.",
      "In 2023, a judge ruled Mr. Trump, his family and his company \"repeatedly\" violated fraud law and imposed a nine-figure judgment against them in the case brought by James. An appeals court threw out the financial penalties earlier this year, calling them \"excessive.\" The appellate judges were divided on the merits of the case and did not strike down some non-financial penalties, including restrictions on the Trump Organization.",
      "James's attorneys have argued the case against her should be tossed out due to vindictive prosecution and \"outrageous government conduct.\" They've argued the charges stemmed from Mr. Trump's enmity toward James \u2014 pointing to a Truth Social post in which the president urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into her \u2014 and were the product of \"unethical behavior\" by several officials at the Justice Department and the Fair Housing Finance Authority.",
      "Halligan's office sought charges against Comey and James following upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Her predecessor as the office's top prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned in late September amid fears among staff that he would be forced out for refusing to charge James, CBS News has previously reported. Days later, Halligan \u2014 a former White House staffer and personal attorney to Mr. Trump \u2014 was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney. Comey was indicted less than a week after that, and James was indicted a few weeks later.",
      "Both Comey and James argued that Halligan was not legally appointed to her role, and asked for their charges to be tossed out. U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie dismissed their indictments without prejudice, meaning the government could attempt to indict them again.",
      "It's unclear whether the Justice Department will also try to re-indict Comey for allegedly lying to Congress in 2020 since the statute of limitations for those charges expired in late September. A federal law gives the government a six-month extension when indictments are dismissed after the statute of limitations for a case expires, but Currie wrote in her order that the law may not apply in Comey's case because the indictment may not have been valid to begin with.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Military officials showed lawmakers video of a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and testified that there was no order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to kill everyone on board, multiple lawmakers said.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, briefed the leaders of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees for both the House and the Senate. The classified briefings centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the\u00a0Sept. 2 follow-on strike\u00a0that has become a flashpoint in Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has been under fire since the Washington Post reported that a second missile killed two survivors of the initial strike. Hegseth has said the decision to strike the boat again was made by Bradley, who was leading the mission. The survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, spoke with reporters after the briefings. They both said Bradley told them that he had not been ordered to leave no survivors. The\u00a0initial Post report\u00a0quoted an anonymous source as saying that, before the first strike, Hegseth verbally ordered that everyone on the boat be taken out. \"The order was to kill everybody,\" the Post's story quoted the source as saying. Hegseth has denied the Post's account.",
      "The lawmakers also said they were shown the video of the second attack, which has not been made public. Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "\"You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States,\" Himes said.",
      "\"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors \u2014 bad guys, bad guys \u2014 but attacking shipwrecked sailors,\" Himes added. \"Now there's a whole set of contextual items that the admiral explained \u2014 yes, they were carrying drugs. They were not in the position to continue their mission in any way. People will someday see this video, and they will see that that video shows, if you don't have the broader context, an attack on shipwrecked sailors.\"",
      "President Trump said Wednesday that he would support releasing the footage.",
      "Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, refuted Himes' characterization of the video after his briefing, saying he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it.\"",
      "Cotton said the four strikes on Sept. 2 were \"entirely lawful and needful, and they were exactly what we'd expect our military commanders to do.\"",
      "\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight, and potentially, given all the context we've heard of other narco-terrorist boats in the area coming to their aid to recover the cargo and recover those narco-terrorists,\" Cotton said.",
      "Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee and was also briefed, told reporters, \"I think it'd be hard to watch this series of videos and not be troubled,\" and said he has \"more policy questions than ever\" about the mission.",
      "Coons said there were certain aspects of the briefing that he found more reassuring concerning process and intelligence, but \"more broadly, what we are asking the men and women of our armed forces, and particularly the special forces, to do, I think still lacks clear justification.\"",
      "\"The underlying judgment that frames this entire operation is that if there is a boat with narcotics and people who are affiliated with a narcotics trafficking organization, that that's a legitimate target,\" Coons said. \"I've still got questions about that.\"",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he was \"deeply disturbed by what I saw this morning,\" and called for the Pentagon to release the footage of the second strike.",
      "\"This briefing confirmed my worst fears about the nature of the Trump Administration's military activities, and demonstrates exactly why the Senate Armed Services Committee has repeatedly requested\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and been denied\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fundamental information, documents, and facts about this operation. This must and will be the only beginning of our investigation into this incident.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also called the video \"very disturbing\" and said all members of Congress should see it. But Warner declined to weigh in on the legality or morality of it.",
      "GOP Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement after the briefings that there is \"no doubt in my mind about the highly professional manner in which the Department of War conducted, and is conducting the operations our nation has called them to do to protect the homeland.\"",
      "\"I am deeply concerned by the public statements made by others that seek to ignore the realities of targeting terrorists to score political points,\" he added.",
      "The strike has sparked bipartisan concern from lawmakers and vows to investigate. Though the administration has argued the follow-on strike was legal and justified, members of Congress and experts have questioned its legality, with accusations from some Democrats that it would constitute a war crime if the second strike targeted survivors.",
      "The strike was the first of the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere, which has now grown to more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. The attacks attracted scrutiny from lawmakers even before the Post's report, since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. The administration has argued it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes because it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations and U.S. troops are not in harm's way.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Authorities say the FBI has arrested a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside RNC and DNC headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
    "story": [
      "A northern Virginia man was arrested and accused of placing two pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal authorities announced Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi identified the suspect as Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old from Woodbridge, Virginia, located just outside Washington, D.C. Cole was charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said, adding that more charges were possible in the investigation, which was still active and ongoing. He's the first suspect arrested in the yearslong pipe bomb investigation.",
      "Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge and works in a bail bondsman's office, an FBI agent said in court documents. The school district for Prince William County, Virginia, which includes Woodbridge, confirmed to CBS News that Cole graduated from high school in 2013.",
      "Cole was arrested early Thursday morning and investigators were still executing search warrants in the afternoon, Bondi told reporters during a news conference.",
      "An unidentified FBI agent said in a probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday that Cole allegedly bought multiple items in 2019 and 2020 that were consistent with the components used to make the pipe bombs.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone provider records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states.",
      "The court documents don't make any references to the Capitol riot that took place the following day. During Thursday's news conference, Bondi didn't provide details about the suspect's possible motive.",
      "\"Right now, it's ongoing,\" she said. \"Again, we just executed the search warrant early, early this morning. It's ongoing, but America's safer, D.C.'s safer because he's in custody.\"",
      "Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to Thursday's arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a team of experts reevaluated the evidence, describing them as \"the best at what they do in their specific fields.\"",
      "\"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant, and when you get a search warrant, you get an address, and when you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did,\" Patel said.",
      "The arrest marks a major step forward in a case that has vexed the FBI for nearly five years.  The pipe bombs were placed outside DNC and RNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, federal investigators have said.",
      "The devices \u2014 made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder \u2014 did not detonate, but the FBI has called them viable and warned they could have killed or injured people.",
      "The bombs were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as police in the area were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol building nearby. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the DNC headquarters shortly after the devices were found.",
      "\"We are grateful to the law enforcement officers who have dedicated years to investigating the pipe bombs planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6th insurrection,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said following the arrest. \"Those responsible for this horrific act must be brought to justice, and political violence should never be accepted in America.\"",
      "Over the subsequent months and years, federal law enforcement scoured the country for alleged Capitol riot participants, tracking down and charging more than 1,500 people.",
      "But the pipe bomb case had remained a lingering mystery amid the events of that week. The FBI had not made an arrest or identified a suspect before Thursday, though it has periodically released footage of a potential suspect \u2014 grainy security camera images of a shadowy figure in a hoodie \u2014 and offered $500,000 for information.",
      "In May, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X the pipe bomb investigation was one of several unsolved cases that had drawn \"additional resources and investigative attention.\" He said he had received weekly briefings on the case and the FBI was \"making progress.\"",
      "Nick  Kurtz and \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:49:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The Pentagon watchdog released its report on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of Signal to share details about operations in Yemen.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth jeopardized sensitive military information that could have endangered American service members when he shared certain details about U.S. military operations in Yemen in a private Signal group chat earlier this year, according to a report\u00a0the Pentagon's inspector general released Thursday morning.",
      "The report found the former Fox News host-turned-defense secretary violated Defense Department policies when he used his personal device for official business to transmit sensitive U.S. military information to other top Trump officials and the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine. CBS News reported the key findings of the report ahead of its release based on multiple sources.",
      "\"Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,\" the report said.",
      "The report also said Hegseth's \"actions created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.\"",
      "A classified version of the inspector general's report was sent to Congress on Tuesday. An unredacted version was released Thursday.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the review \"is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along - no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.\"",
      "Hegseth also called the review a \"total exoneration,\" writing on X: \"No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission. Thank you for your attention to this IG report.\"",
      "The report said that while Hegseth has the authority to declassify information as secretary, \"based on our review, we concluded that some information from the secretary sent from his personal cell phone on Signal on March 15, 2025, matched the operational information USCENTCOM sent and classified as SECRET/NOFORN.\" CBS News previously\u00a0reported\u00a0on the classified source of information and that it had been shared by Army Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, who at the time was the commander of U.S. Central Command, the primary combatant unit overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia.",
      "According to U.S. Central Command's Security Classification Guide, the operational movement of aircraft should be classified as SECRET, the report found. However, the secretary of defense is authorized to declassify information as appropriate.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means the information was classified, and the disclosure of the information without proper declassification could potentially cause serious damage to national security and jeopardize the safety of service members, according to the U.S. government.",
      "The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "Hegseth declined to be interviewed for the report, the inspector general said, opting instead to respond to questions in writing.",
      "The secretary did not provide his personal cell phone to the IG, according to the report. His office did provide some messages that matched those published in the Atlantic, but excluded \"a number of messages that had auto-deleted by the time the information was captured from the Secretary's phone because of settings in the chat.\"",
      "The IG was told Hegseth posted the same information in separate Signal chats, so the IG requested copies of messages from other group chats. Because the IG did not have access to Hegseth's phone, he was not \"able to verify whether any of the additionally identified Signal chats also contained sensitive, classified, or other nonpublic DoD information.\"",
      "The sources familiar with the inspector general's investigation said the report found that if the information had been intercepted by a foreign adversary, it would have clearly endangered U.S. service members and the mission.",
      "A day after the Signal chat story was published by The Atlantic, U.S. Africa Command, in coordination with the government of Somalia, conducted multiple airstrikes against affiliates of the Islamic State terrorist organization. A press release said the airstrikes occurred near the Golis Mountains in Somalia and that multiple \"ISIS-Somalia operatives were killed.\"",
      "After multiple Trump administration officials claimed the information in the Signal chat group was unclassified, CBS News filed a request in March under the Freedom of Information Act to U.S. Africa Command to see if similar information deemed unclassified by Hegseth from the Yemen airstrike could be released regarding the March 25 airstrike on the ISIS operatives in Somalia.",
      "CBS News requested information about the airstrike that was similar to the information appearing in the Signal chat group about the strikes and that Trump intelligence officials had said was unclassified.",
      "In early September, CBS News received a response from U.S. Africa Command, which arrived at the same conclusion as the Pentagon inspector general about the Somalia airstrike \u2014 that the material if released could jeopardize national security.",
      "\"[The] information that is currently and properly classified pursuant to Executive Order 13526. \u2026 In this case, I have determined that the release of the documents would foreseeably harm national security,\" Marine Maj. Gen. Matthew Trollinger, the chief of staff to Air Force Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, wrote in his letter to CBS News.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the IG's review \"affirms what the Administration has said from the beginning \u2014 no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.\"",
      "She went on to say, \"The President's entire national security team is doing great work advancing American interests while protecting sensitive information,\" adding, \"President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth.\"",
      "In separate statements on Wednesday, the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees called for Hegseth to resign.",
      "Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said the report \"notes that the IG is aware of several other Signal chats Hegseth used for official business, underscoring that this was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head.\"",
      "\"Pete Hegseth's behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,\" Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said. \"What's more, his refusal to sit for an interview with the Inspector General or submit his device for examination is yet another example of his failure to take responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS News in an interview that the report showed \"a jaw-dropping breach of our national security, and Hegseth needs to resign immediately.\"",
      "\"When you tell somebody that 30 minutes after the drone strikes, our aircraft will be on position at this location, that's classified information in the f---ing middle of an operation. You're telling the enemy, 'hey, by the way, 30 minutes after the drones hit, be ready to shoot our aircraft out of the sky, because they're going to be there.' That's classified operational information,\" Duckworth said. \"And this argument that Hegseth has the authority just by sharing it, he declassified, it doesn't make it right. It just means that they're trying to cover their asses.\"",
      "Last month, Hegseth joked about the \"Signalgate\" scandal while speaking at Fox Nation's Patriot Awards after spotting United Nations Ambassador Mike Waltz in the audience.",
      "\"I see Mike Waltz \u2014 Mike, I'll hit you up on Signal later.\"",
      "Kaia  Hubbard and \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The overhaul also applies to immigrants with pending applications for asylum or permanent U.S. residency, known as green cards. Those processes that usually take years to complete, mainly because of a massive backlog of unresolved cases.",
      "Under the new rules, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will issue work permits to these populations that last for a maximum of 18 months, instead of the current 5-year period.",

      "\"Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorization will ensure that those seeking to work in the United States do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,\" USCIS Director Joseph Edlow said in a statement.",

      "In the wake of last week's shooting in D.C., which killed one National Guard member and left another in critical condition, the Trump administration has dramatically expanded its immigration crackdown, curtailing pathways for certain immigrants to enter or stay in the U.S. legally.",

      "Two people who survived the U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. They appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up, the head of Special Operations Command Admiral Mitch Bradley was expected to tell lawmakers on Thursday, the source said.",
      "ABC News was first to report the additional details on the strike. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video of ABC News' report on X.",
      "The Sept. 2 mission \u2014 the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug boats by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 has drawn bipartisan scrutiny since last week, when The Washington Post reported that the military carried out at least two strikes on the same boat in the Caribbean, killing a pair of survivors from the initial hit. The newspaper alleged in its report that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth had said that everybody on board the boat should be killed.",
      "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it. Hegseth has said the decision was made by Bradley, the mission's commander, and argued the follow-up strike was legal and justified.",
      "Bradley and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked lawmakers through a video of the second strike in classified testimony on Thursday before the House and Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees. Bradley testified that Hegseth didn't issue an order for everybody to be killed, multiple lawmakers later told reporters.",
      "Members of Congress offered divergent views on the video. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut called it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" describing the two survivors as people \"in clear distress\" who were \"not in the position to continue their mission in any way.\" But Republican Sen.

      "Even before the recent revelations, the campaign of boat strikes had drawn broader legal questions, with critics arguing the president doesn't have the authority to order military operations against alleged traffickers without congressional approval. In the past, the U.S. has typically sought to interdict drug smugglers at sea, essentially treating them like criminals rather than combatants. The Trump administration has argued the strikes are lawful because the U.S. is engaged in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels that it views as terrorist organizations.",

    "title": "Trump thinks tariff revenue could replace income taxes. Is that possible?",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-cutting-income-tax-tariff-revenue/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

      "Democrats had the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice. Some moderates sought a compromise position that would stand a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance. Schumer's decision to seek a clean extension means the bill is highly unlikely to pick up support from Republicans, although the move so will force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Republicans rejected Schumer's offer of a clean extension toward the end of the government shutdown.",

    "summary": "Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform released \"never-before-seen\" images of Jeffrey Epstein's private island.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Wednesday that the committee has received financial records related to Jeffrey Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, while releasing what they said were \"never-before-seen\" photos and videos of Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "The financial documents could offer a window into Epstein's extensive business dealings and connections. Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018. He died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Both banks reached legal settlements in 2023 over their involvement with Epstein. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit from his accusers claiming the bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking. JPMorgan settled its own suit for $290 million, CBS News reported at the time. Both banks have said they regret their association with Epstein.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said Democrats plan to make the financial records public \"in the days ahead.\"",
      "New photos and videos of Epstein's island",
      "The committee also released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island, known as Little St. James, that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "\"These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island,\" Garcia said in a statement. \"We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes. We won't stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors. It's time for President Trump to release all the files, now.\"",
      "Some of the images and footage, including unredacted versions of several photos, were previously published by O'Keefe Media Group, a conservative outlet.",
      "The photos released by the committee show what appear to be various rooms in the estate, including bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens. One photo shows partially redacted handwriting on a blackboard in an office. Another shows what appears to be a medical office with masks of men's faces hanging from the walls. Others show various views from outside the buildings:",
      "One of the photos shows a dentist's chair, which a source tell CBS News was put in for one of Epstein's girlfriend, a European woman who was studying to be a dentist.",
      "The Oversight Committee sent a request to the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general on Nov. 18 for all documents, communications and other information about investigations or potential criminal investigations related to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell, according to Garcia. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for \"conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors,\" as the Justice Department put it in 2022 when she was sentenced.",
      "Separate from the records the Oversight Committee has released, Congress passed and President Trump signed a law giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. That 30-day countdown began after the law was signed on Nov. 19. It's not yet clear how much information will be redacted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 06:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Democrats are looking to win back the Georgia governor's office after decades of GOP control.",
    "story": [
      "Former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has won the support of an influential national political organization whose help could prove critical as she tries to become the next governor of Georgia.",
      "EMILYs List \u2014 which focuses on supporting Democratic women in favor of abortion rights \u2014\u00a0 is endorsing Bottoms on Thursday as she faces a competitive primary field on the left, CBS News has learned. Georgia Republicans have held the governor's office for most of the 21st century, even as Democrats have succeeded in winning both of the state's Senate seats in recent years. But some Democrats are hopeful that dissatisfaction with President Trump could help the party across the board in midterm races.",
      "\"Donald Trump, he very proudly wears the crown of chaos. So this time around, it's going to be about having this battle-tested leadership, being willing and able to stand up to Donald Trump and the chaos that he's bringing to our communities, but also leading and being innovative in figuring out how we weather this storm,\" said Bottoms, whose tenure as mayor largely played out during Mr. Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "When Bottoms announced her statewide campaign earlier this year, a spokeswoman for the Republican Governors Association greeted her run with a statement saying that \"the gubernatorial primary is shaping up to be nothing but disappointing for Georgia Democrats.\" The group added that \"the last thing Georgians want is to bring her policies to the entire state. Bottoms is a risk Georgians cannot afford.\"",
      "After a tenure that included leading her city during the coronavirus pandemic and through the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd, Bottoms announced in 2021 she would not run for another term as mayor.",
      "Bottoms later worked as a senior adviser for former President Joe Biden's White House. She announced her run for governor in May, and is now part of a contested primary field on the Democratic side. Former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who switched parties after serving statewide as a Republican and opposing Mr. Trump, is running against Bottoms to try to be the party's pick for governor. The field also includes former Democratic state Sen. Jason Esteves.",
      "If Bottoms wins in the general election, she would become the first Black woman to be elected governor in United States history.",
      "\"She's led Georgians through some of the toughest challenges that people can face in office, and she is the right person to stand up right now and fight back against the chaos that is making lives harder for people in Georgia and deliver that more stable, affordable, everyday life for working families,\" EMILYs List President Jessica Mackler said.",
      "Democrats are eying a potentially advantageous political environment in next year's midterms as they try to win back power in Washington and in state capitol's around the country. Back in 2018, during Mr. Trump's first midterm cycle as president, Democrat Stacey Abrams fell short against Republican Brian Kemp in the race for governor, even as Democrats in other races were able to take advantage of concerns about the incumbent president's party.",
      "But in the years that followed, Democrats saw a series of breakthroughs in Georgia, starting with Biden's narrow victory over Mr. Trump in the state in the 2020 presidential election. Weeks later, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock defeated Republicans in run-off elections for the state's pair of seats in the Senate. During the 2022 midterm cycle, Warnock won a full term in the Senate even though Abrams' repeat challenge against Kemp failed.",
      "Then in the 2024 presidential election, Mr. Trump carried Georgia on his way to a second term in the White House, setting up the state to once again be a crucial political attention point in next year's midterms as both parties look to build momentum heading into the 2028 presidential election.",
      "\"We know what's possible in this state, but it's going to require us to keep our heads down and stay focused, to keep running hard, and most importantly, to keep listening to people,\" Bottoms said.",

    "story": [
      "A series of multimillion-dollar alleged fraud schemes in Minnesota has drawn the Trump administration's attention in recent weeks, vaulting an issue that has brewed in state politics for years into the national conversation.",
      "President Trump has attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz over the fraud cases, calling Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and lashing out against the state's Somali community. And Walz is facing an investigation by U.S. House Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, federal prosecutors have continued to bring new charges against alleged fraudsters in the midwestern state in recent months. And this week, the U.S. Treasury said it will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia, bringing the fraud cases back into the spotlight.",
      "Here's what to know about the cases:",
      "What was the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme?",
      "Three years ago, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed the first charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States.\"",
      "The $250 million scheme \u2014 which now includes upward of 75 defendants \u2014 revolved around a nonprofit group called Feeding Our Future that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecutors say, Feeding Our Future and its affiliated food distribution sites submitted fake meal count sheets and invoices to trick state and federal officials into thinking they had helped serve food to thousands of children. The group allegedly raked in millions in administrative fees for the fake meal distributions, and got kickbacks from people who ran their distribution sites, according to federal charging documents.",
      "Feeding Our Future's founder, Aimee Bock, was convicted at trial earlier this year. Several other defendants, including distribution site operators, have pleaded guilty or been convicted, in some cases receiving multiyear prison sentences and being ordered to pay millions in restitution. One defendant also pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror, after a member of the jury in his fraud trial found a bag with $120,000 in cash at her home.",
      "Bock has long denied wrongdoing. At various points before charges were filed, Minnesota officials questioned some of the group's filings and slowed approvals of distribution sites, leading Feeding Our Future to file a lawsuit accusing the state of discrimination.",
      "The case was part of a trend of large-scale fraud across the U.S. during the pandemic, as the federal government poured money into assistance programs at a rapid clip. One former federal watchdog estimated to \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that COVID-19 fraud may have cost taxpayers some $1 trillion.",
      "Prosecutors said the program that was allegedly co-opted by Feeding Our Future \u2014 the Federal Child Nutrition Program \u2014 became more vulnerable to fraud during the pandemic. Oversight was more difficult because of the health crisis, and federal officials waived some of the program's rules to let restaurants participate and allow off-site meal distribution.",
      "State officials have also faced scrutiny. A probe last year by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor found the Minnesota Department of Education \"created opportunities for fraud\" by failing to act on warning signs with Feeding Our Future or investigate complaints about the group.",
      "What other fraud allegations have circulated in Minnesota?",
      "The Feeding Our Future scheme isn't the only fraud case to rattle Minnesota politics.",
      "In August, state officials shut down a fairly new program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing after discovering \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "A month later, federal prosecutors charged eight people with allegedly defrauding the program, which was run through the state's Medicaid service, by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Prosecutors said the housing stabilization program was susceptible to fraud because it intentionally had \"low barriers to entry\" and few recordkeeping requirements. They also noted that spending on the program had ballooned to more than $100 million last year, despite initial estimates that it would cost around $2.6 million a year.",
      "And in late September, a person was charged with defrauding a third state program \u2014 in this case, one that provides services to children with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program.",
      "She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program, in some cases sending them as much as $1,500, prosecutors said.",
      "The same person, Asha Farhan Hassan, was also charged in September with running a fraudulent food distribution site as part of the Feeding Our Future scheme.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said the case \"is not an isolated scheme.\"",
      "\"From Feeding Our Future to Housing Stabilization Services and now Autism Services, these massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,\" the federal prosecutor wrote in a statement.",
      "Kelly Loeffler, who leads the U.S. Small Business Administration, also alleged Tuesday that some of the groups linked to the Feeding Our Future scheme received COVID-era emergency loans. She said she has ordered an \"investigation into the network of Somali organizations and executives implicated in these schemes.\" She did not provide details on the probe.",
      "What is the connection to Minnesota's Somali community?",
      "Most of the people charged in the Feeding Our Future case are of Somali descent, though Bock, the group's founder and the scheme's alleged \"mastermind,\" is White.",
      "Prosecutors in the alleged autism services fraud scheme said the defendant \"approached parents in the Somali community to recruit their children.\"",
      "The named fraud defendants appear to represent a small percentage of Minnesota's Somali American community, which is among the largest in the nation.",
      "Some 76,000 people of Somali descent live in the state, more than half of whom were born in the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures from last year. The vast majority of the state's foreign-born Somali population has U.S. citizenship, and most entered the U.S. before 2010.",
      "Around 65% of Somali people in Minnesota ages 16 and over were employed as of last year, according to the Census Bureau, roughly equivalent to the state population as a whole.",
      "Last year, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office, Kayseh Magan, wrote about what he called an \"uncomfortable and true\" reality that many people who have been charged with fraud in the state are of Somali descent.",
      "He wrote that \"fraud occurs when desire meets opportunity,\" noting that many Somali Americans are \"poor, desperate and seek shortcuts,\" and their families in the impoverished East African country frequently rely on money from their U.S.-based relatives. He said Somali service providers often leverage trust within the community to recruit friends and relatives into their programs. Many victims of these fraud schemes are Somali, too, he added.",
      "Has Minnesota taxpayer money made its way to the terror group al Shabaab?",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that his department will investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to al Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda and a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization based in Somalia.",
      "Bessent appeared to be responding to a report in the conservative magazine City Journal that alleged millions from state programs \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources.",
      "Those allegations have circulated for years. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found its way to terrorists.",
      "Multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",
      "What has President Trump said?",
      "Mr. Trump has blamed the fraud schemes on Somali people, whom he has attacked in often incendiary terms in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the president called immigrants from Somalia \"garbage,\" and claimed they \"destroyed Minnesota\" and \"contribute nothing.\"",

      "Somalia is also one of 19 countries that have faced near-total travel bans and a halt to immigration applications. And Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations are underway this week in the Minneapolis area, CBS News has reported.",

      "Minnesota lawmakers and members of the state's Somali community have castigated Mr. Trump for the comments. In an interview with \"Meet The Press\" last weekend, Walz said the fraud issue \"is totally disconnected with demonizing an entire group of people who came here, fleeing civil war, and created a vibrant community that makes Minnesota and this country better.\"",
      "What has Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said about the fraud schemes?",
      "Walz, who has served as Minnesota's governor since 2019, told NBC's \"Meet The Press\" on Sunday that his state has sought to crack down on fraud. He also pointed to the state's generosity.",
      "\"Minnesota is a generous state. Minnesota is a prosperous state, a well-run state. We're AAA-bond rated,\" said the governor and 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee. \"But that attracts criminals. Those people are going to jail. We're doing everything we can.\"",
      "Asked this week about the U.S. Treasury's investigation into claims that tax money may have gone to al Shabaab, Walz said the state welcomes federal help and wants to crack down on fraud, but added: \"I don't think anybody in here really believes their motive and their timing,\" referring to the Trump administration and congressional Republicans.",
      "Meanwhile, the governor and his administration have faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud, dating back to the Feeding Our Future scheme's emergence in 2022. Republican officials have long argued the state failed to carry out due diligence and was slow to act in that scheme \u2014 though Walz has insisted the state caught the fraud early but was stymied by court battles and asked by the FBI not to cut off payments during its investigation.",
      "That scrutiny has resurged in recent weeks. Earlier Wednesday, Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, opened an investigation into fraud in Minnesota's public assistance programs.",
      "\"The Committee has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" Comer said in a letter requesting documents from Walz. \"The Committee also has concerns that you and your administration were fully aware of this fraud and chose not to act for fear of political retaliation.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 21:49:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The former officials said the FDA's plans to revamp how certain life-saving vaccines are handled would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
    "story": [
      "A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \u2014 appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike \u2014 issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.",
      "The former officials said the agency's plans to revamp how life-saving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled \u2014 outlined in an internal FDA memo last week \u2014 would \"disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.\"",
      "\"The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA's understanding of its job,\" the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The internal memo by FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad hasn't been publicly released. The memo said a review \"found that at least 10 children have died after and because of receiving COVID-19 vaccination,\" multiple sources familiar with it told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "Prasad suggested that the deaths were related to myocarditis, or the inflammation of the heart muscle, the sources said. Prasad did not share any data used in the review, including the children's ages, whether they had existing health conditions, or how the FDA determined there was a link between their death and the vaccine. The findings were not published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.",
      "It went on to outline planned agency changes in handling those and certain other vaccines and said that FDA staff who disagreed should resign.",
      "Among Prasad's plans were revising how yearly flu shot updates are handled and focusing more on \"the benefits and harms of giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" A common message of vaccine skeptics is that too many shots may overwhelm kids' immune systems or that ingredients may build up to cause harm, although scientists say repeated research into those claims has turned up no concerns.",
      "On Wednesday, the former FDA leaders wrote that Prasad's claim about child deaths related to COVID-19 vaccines had been reported to a surveillance system that doesn't contain medical records or other information sufficient to prove a link \u2014 and that government scientists had carefully combed through those reports in previous years, reaching different conclusions. They also noted that \"substantial evidence\" shows COVID-19 vaccines reduce children's risk of severe disease and hospitalization.",
      "\"The memo asserts, incorrectly, that 'we do not have reliable data' on the benefits of Covid vaccination in children,\" the former FDA officials wrote. \"Reasonable scientists should engage in open debate about how best to shape recommendations for children at lower risk for Covid-19, but substantial evidence shows that vaccination can reduce the risk of severe disease and hospitalization in many children and adolescents.\"",
      "But the bigger picture, the former FDA leaders argued, is that the new proposals would reject long-standing science about how to evaluate vaccines being updated to better match virus strains, slow innovation to replace older vaccines with newer, potentially better ones, and make the process less transparent to the public.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Wednesday night, \"The fact these criticisms are coming from former FDA officials who opposed raising the bar for vaccine science confirms we are on the right track.\"",
      "Many doctors and public health experts have also expressed alarm about the memo.",
      "\"Vaccines save lives, period,\" Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a statement. \"It is a sad day when FDA creates confusion and mistrust without supplying evidence, spreading propaganda that makes lifesaving vaccines harder to access and that creates additional confusion and mistrust for the public.\"",
      "The FDA's planned vaccine changes come at a time when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years \u2014 is seeking to broadly remake federal policies on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy already ousted a committee that advised the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine recommendations and replaced it with handpicked members. And in August, he fired Susan Monarez 29 days into her tenure as CDC chief over vaccine policy disagreements. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss hepatitis B vaccinations in newborns and other vaccine topics.",

      "The Trump administration is looking into whether Minnesota tax money found its way to al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Monday. And on Wednesday, House Oversight committee chairman Rep. James Comer announced he is launching an investigation into the widespread fraud allegations.",
      "Bessent wrote on X that the Treasury is \"investigating allegations that under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden Administration and Governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans' tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.\"",
      "The Treasury secretary shared a Nov. 19 report in the conservative publication City Journal that alleged millions of dollars from Minnesota state welfare programs had \"ultimately landed in the hands of the terror group Al-Shabaab,\" citing law enforcement sources. Several Minnesota Republicans, including Rep. Tom Emmer, pushed federal prosecutors to look into the allegations.",
      "Walz's office pointed CBS News to remarks last week in which the governor said he welcomes an investigation into where defrauded welfare money went and would work with investigators.",
      "Comer, a Republican from Kentucky, released an excerpt from a letter he sent Walz, saying the Oversight Committee \"has serious concerns about how you as the Governor, and the Democrat-controlled administration, allowed millions of dollars to be stolen,\" and requesting \"documents and communications showing what your administration knew about this fraud and whether you took action to limit or halt the investigation.\"",
      "Minnesota has been racked by allegations of large-scale fraud in the state's public assistance programs. Dozens of people have been charged in a $250 million scheme involving the nonprofit group Feeding Our Future and its partners, which federal prosecutors say stole federal nutrition aid by falsely claiming to help distribute meals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials have also brought fraud charges involving housing aid and autism programs in the state.",
      "Many of the defendants in these alleged fraud schemes are members of Minnesota's large Somali community, a Somali American former investigator in the Minnesota attorney general's office wrote in an opinion piece last year. The former investigator, Kayseh Magan, added that community members are also frequently victims of the schemes.",
      "President Trump has repeatedly lashed out against Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" and announcing an end to temporary deportation protections for Somali people in the midwestern state. Last week, the president alleged, without evidence, that \"hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state.\"",
      "Walz and other Minnesota Democrats have defended the state's Somali community. The governor told reporters last month, in response to the claims about al Shabaab: \"Do not paint an entire group of people with that same brush, demonizing them, putting them at risk, when there is no proof of that.\"",
      "Claims that state money could be flowing to al Shabaab and other terror groups have circulated for years in Minnesota. A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that Child Care Assistance Program funding is going to terrorist groups, though the organization didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have been sent overseas and eventually found its way to terrorists.",
      "Andy Lugar, a Biden- and Obama-era U.S. attorney for Minnesota, told The Minnesota Star Tribune last month that those charged in the Feeding Our Future fraud scheme \"were looking to get rich, not fund overseas terrorism.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday formally announced a new immigration enforcement crackdown in New Orleans, the latest city led by Democrats to see a surge in Border Patrol agents tasked with carrying out President Trump's mass deportation campaign.",
      "DHS said it dubbed the operation \"Catahoula Crunch,\" confirming plans\u00a0reported by CBS News in mid-November. At the time, CBS News reported that Border Patrol was planning to dispatch roughly 200 agents to New Orleans, to oversee operations there targeting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. Internal agency documents showed officials requested armored vehicles for the operation.",
      "CBS News spoke Wednesday with Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino outside U.S. Customs and Border Protection's office in the city. Bovino said they'd be in the Big Easy \"until the mission is accomplished,\" and that so far they've arrested \"a lot, and still counting.\" There are \"several hundred agents\" spread across the New Orleans area, Bovino said.",
      "In a statement earlier Wednesday, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the administration targeted New Orleans because of local policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement officials and federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto, and rape,\" McLaughlin added. \"Under President Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are restoring law and order for the American people.\"",
      "Catahoulas are the official state dogs of Louisiana.",
      "Two U.S. officials told CBS News that DHS has asked the Department of Defense for permission to use Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans as a staging area for immigration operations.",
      "Coinciding with the DHS announcement, the FBI's field office in New Orleans said it was partnering with the Louisiana State Police to protect the federal immigration agents deployed to the area and to curtail \"attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said he was planning to deploy National Guard troops to New Orleans for a separate anti-crime operation \"in a couple of weeks,\" though the administration has not announced an exact date. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has welcomed the plan to dispatch National Guard members, saying the deployment is needed to curb violent crime.",
      "The Border Patrol crackdown in New Orleans is the most recent immigration enforcement operation launched by the second Trump administration in a Democratic-controlled city. The administration has deployed hundreds of Border Patrol agents to cities far away from a U.S. border, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Border Patrol's operations, led by controversial commander Bovino, have been met with harsh criticism from some local residents and elected officials, who have accused Bovino and his agents of inflaming tensions through aggressive arrests and heavy-handed tactics against protesters and other civilians. A federal judge in the Chicago area ruled that Border Patrol's use of force had been excessive.",
      "But Bovino has also been praised by supporters as a no-nonsense enforcer of Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. He has defended his agents' actions, including their use of force against protesters, as justified given violent acts by some individuals.",
      "Who Border Patrol has been arresting in these operations has also garnered controversy. In Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, Border Patrol agents have been depicted on video smashing car windows and arresting day laborers and other workers during \"roving patrols\" at Home Depot parking lots and other locations.",
      "While Bovino and other Trump administration officials have said Border Patrol is primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed serious crimes, CBS News reported last month that out of roughly 270 arrests in the Charlotte area, fewer than 90 detainees \u2014 roughly one third \u2014 were classified as criminals.",

    "summary": "The U.S. has increased its reward to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "The United States government on Wednesday increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano, an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Through an organized crime rewards program operated by the Department of State, officials are now offering up to $5 million for tips that could bring Serrano into custody and potentially convict him on myriad drug charges.",
      "Mosquera Serrano was the first alleged member of Tren de Aragua to be added to the FBI's \"most wanted\" list, according to the State Department. He was initially indicted in Texas district court in January and charged with international cocaine trafficking conspiracy, then recharged in a second indictment in April that additionally accused him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, when he retook office in January. His administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the strikes are legal, and the first in that string of attacks, a deadly strike in early September, has prompted new concerns from Congress\u00a0that a follow-on strike despite there apparently being survivors in the water may constitute a war crime.",
      "Tren de Aragua's members are accused of a lengthy record of violent crimes, including murder, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, bribery and racketeering. Originally formed inside Venezuela's Tocor\u00f3n prison, Tren de Aragua expanded during the incarceration of Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the alleged head of the gang known as Ni\u00f1o Guerrero. U.S. authorities have said Guerrero came to control the prison in addition to a series of gold mines and border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, before eventually escaping custody.",
      "Mosquera Serrano is among the alleged members of Tren de Aragua who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which sanctioned 11 more alleged affiliates of the gang on Wednesday, according to the State Department.",
      "One of the latest rounds of sanctions also targeted Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, a Venezuelan entertainer known as \"Rosita,\" the U.S. Treasury announced, claiming she is a Tren de Aragua affiliate. Rosita is allegedly part of a group of five people in the entertainment industry who are accused of providing \"material support\" to the gang, according to the Treasury. She has also been accused of helping Guerrero escape from prison in 2012, while the group of five allegedly helped launder money for some of the gang's leaders, the department said.",
      "\"Under President Trump, barbaric terrorist cartels can no longer operate with impunity across our borders,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release. \"At the direction of President Trump, we will continue to use every tool to cut off these terrorists from the U.S. and global financial system and keep American citizens safe.\"",

      "Mr. Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somali descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they \"have caused a lot of trouble,\" which is rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.",
      "On Monday evening, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also announced his department is investigating whether Minnesota tax money found its way to al Shabaab, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and al Qaeda affiliate based in Somalia.",

      "In a joint news conference on Tuesday afternoon, the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, along with Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara and Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, said they are standing in solidarity with the metro's Somali community.",
      "\"To our Somali community, I love you, and we stand with you. That commitment is rock solid,\" said Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. \"Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the entire country. They've been here for decades, in many instances. Entrepreneurs and fathers, they benefit both the cultures and the economic resilience of our city.\"",
      "Frey said the targeting of Minnesota's Somali population \"means due process will be violated.\"",
      "\"Mistakes will be made, and let's be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained, for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,\" Frey said. \"That is not now and will never be a legitimate reason.\"",
      "St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter said the actions of the Trump administration are \"un-American.\"",
      "\"I grew up in an America that prided itself on being a country of immigrants, that prided itself on the fact that people from other countries would look across a whole ocean and say that's where I want to be. It seems that what we learned was that we've prided ourselves and we have decades and generations of priding ourselves on being a beacon for immigration from Europe,\" Carter said. \"I mean, it seems to many of us, like, the darker-skinned the immigrants who come to our country are, the more our posture on immigration as a country has shifted. That's un-American. That's concerning.\"",
      "Carter said the Twin Cities need to unite to stand up for immigrants and refugees.",
      "\"The last thing that we need is federal agents coming to town attempting to turn us against each other, to turn us against ourselves. The last thing we need is federal agents coming in town to create chaos and challenge for us, and so we stand together,\" Carter said. \"We encourage folks to look to the organizations that serve immigrants and refugees across our community because we have constant reminders out there about what your rights are. You have rights, that's an American thing.\"",
      "Minneapolis City Council member Jamal Osman, who was born in Somalia, pulled no punches in his assessment of the president.",
      "\"One of the things I do want to say, and obviously everyone knows that our president is racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and we're going to fight that,\" Osman said. \"America has a history of fighting and stopping those kind of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.\"",
      "Osman said his community will remain firm amid the current climate of danger.",
      "\"Our community has lived through fear in the past, and we're not gonna let them divide that,\" Osman said.",
      "As head of the Minneapolis police, O'Hara reiterated that his police officers do not work with federal law enforcement who are conducting immigration enforcement.",
      "\"We don't provide information to federal immigration authorities,\" he said. \"We don't ask people about their immigration status. Our mission is clear: to protect life, to uphold the law and to maintain safety for all people in our communities.\"",
      "O'Hara added that officers will receive additional guidance later this week regarding the department's immigration policy.",
      "Many Somali Americans in Minnesota say they've felt a growing sense of uneasiness after Mr. Trump's continued rhetoric against Somalis, which has sparked frustration and fear.",
      "\"I was only 3 years old when I came and this is my home,\" Madino Mudey said. \"This has to stop.\"",
      "A few people at Minneapolis' busiest Somali mall say they noticed what they believe to be federal agents circling the property Tuesday, but authorities haven't confirmed that.",
      "Gov. Walz calls reports of ICE operation \"PR stunt\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, Walz responded to the reports that ICE would target undocumented Somalis in the Twin Cities, calling it \"a PR stunt.\"",
      "\"We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime,\" Walz added. \"Indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.\"",
      "Minnesota has the largest Somali population in the U.S., with the latest census data showing about 80,000 (83,445) living in the Twin Cities metro area. More than 100,000 (107,087) total reside in Minnesota, according to the CBS News Data Team.  Many fled the long civil war in their East African country and were drawn to the state's welcoming social programs.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of \"less than a dozen\" immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.",
      "But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the number of those at earlier stages of the immigration process is a \"pretty small\" proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.",
      "The history behind Minnesota's Somali-American community",
      "Dr. Ahmed Samatar, the founding dean of the Kofi Annan Institute for Global Citizenship at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, spoke with WCCO in 2019 about why so many Somali-Americans have made \"the Land of 10,000 Lakes\" home.",
      "Samatar said it all began in 1991 with Somalia's civil war.",
      "\"Somalis, everyone, they have to flee,\" Samatar said. \"Whoever will take them in, they have to flee.\"",
      "Some stayed in Somalia but were internally displaced. Others went to refugee camps in neighboring countries. Many were sent to other countries all over the world.",
      "According to the Minnesota Department of Human Services, 13,582 Somali refugees came to Minnesota between 2005 and 2018.",
      "\"Of course, when some came, they will tell others about the good news of Minnesota,\" Samatar said. \"I call that the 'call of kinship.'\"",
      "He thinks there are a variety of reasons for what are called \"secondary arrivals,\" but there are a few that stand out. One is the support from local, volunteer resettlement agencies that work with governments to help refugees find housing, schooling and jobs.",
      "Samatar also cited Minnesota's strong economy, which gave Somali-Americans job opportunities \u2014 many in western Minnesota \u2014 schooling options, health care and a safe place to live.",

    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Big leaps in science have made a once-impossible, much-debated question come to life: Would you design your unborn child?",
      "Kian Sadeghi, the 25-year-old founder and CEO at Nucleus Genomics, believes every parent has a right to do just that, selecting qualities they desire \u2013 from height to weight to intelligence. He calls it \"genetic optimization,\" and it's part of a Silicon Valley push to breed \"super-babies.\"",
      "Sadeghi dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania and started the company in 2021, inspired by a cousin who died of a rare genetic illness. Backed by investors and prominent tech entrepreneurs like Peter Thiel and Alexis Ohanian, Sadeghi says his company has already helped thousands of families.",
      "\"It's the parents' right to know\"",
      "\"We give you the full range of insights there is to know about your future child. We really think it's the parents' right to know,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Genetic testing companies like Nucleus say DNA screening of embryos can prevent disease, while also giving parents a unique ability to compare and choose traits that make up a healthier baby \u2013 and one that's more desirable in the eyes of mom and dad.",
      "\"They want us to, you know, play sports and they want us to go to the best school. They want us to be well educated. They want us to thrive. Life, I think, as a parent doesn't just stop at 'I want my child to be healthy,'\" Sadeghi said.",
      "For $30,000, Nucleus offers a program called IVF+, which includes full DNA scans of both parents and up to 20 embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. The results come back in the form of a sleek, user-friendly menu.",
      "Advanced DNA screenings",
      "The company screens embryo samples for more than 2,000 traits and conditions, including eye color, hair color, intelligence \u2013 even acne. It also can estimate genetic predisposition to medical conditions such as depression, autism and bipolar disorder.",
      "Sadeghi says this \"genetic optimization\" allows parents to minimize disease while maximizing traits they prefer. However, critics have drawn comparisons to a different term: \"eugenics.\"",
      "\"[It's not eugenics] by any stretch, because it's fundamentally about empowering people with information that they can use to give their child the best start in life,\" he said. \"And yes, if you want 2 inches taller for your child, 3 inches taller, right, if you want a couple IQ-point difference, absolutely, by all means, do that. But I'm saying, you're really asking me here, you're asking me, what is life about? That's what you're really getting at when you talk about height and IQ, right, they're abstractions of life.\"",
      "Ethical debate over reproductive genetics",
      "But while companies like Nucleus continue to grow, some medical experts point to the ethical dilemmas surrounding these types of new reproductive technologies. An article published in the MIT Technology Review in October argued the race to create the \"perfect baby\" is actually creating an \"ethical mess.\"",
      "In a\u00a0statement last year, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics said the practice of genetic screenings and use of polygenic risk scores for embryo selection has \"moved too fast with too little evidence.\"",
      "\"In this statement we do not address either individual or broader social, ethical, and regulatory issues this testing raises,\" the group noted.",
      "But Sadeghi said he remains confident in the data.",
      "\"Our predictors can better predict longevity from an embryo's DNA than any other genetic model ever built,\" he said.",
      "However, he pushes back on the criticism that he's creating a new class of \"superhumans.\"",
      "\"DNA is not destiny, the messiness of life, the nurture element of life, right, how hard your child works, you know, what school they go to, what resources they have, serendipity, all those factors are never, ever going to go away,\" Sadeghi said.",

    "summary": "Ant colonies act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, according to a team of scientists.",
    "story": [
      "Sick young ants release a smell to tell worker ants to destroy them to protect the colony from infection, scientists said Tuesday, adding that queens do not seem to commit this act of self-sacrifice.",
      "Many animals conceal illness for social reasons. For example, sick humans are known to risk infecting others so they can still go to the office \u2014 or the pub.",
      "Ant colonies, however, act as one \"super-organism\" which works to ensure the survival of all, similar to how infected cells in our bodies send out a \"find-me and eat-me\" signal, according to an Austria-led team of scientists.",
      "Ant nests are a \"perfect place for a disease outbreak to occur because there are thousands of ants crawling over each other,\" Erika Dawson, a behavioral ecologist at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria and lead author of a new study titled \"Altruistic disease signaling in ant colonies,\" told AFP.",
      "When adult worker ants get an illness that could spread through the colony, they leave the nest to die alone. Young ants, known as pupae, in contrast are still trapped inside a cocoon, making this kind of social distancing impossible.",
      "Scientists had already figured out that when these pupae are terminally ill, there is a chemical change that produces a particular smell. Adult worker ants then gather around, remove the cocoon, \"bite holes in the pupae and insert poison,\" Dawson said. The poison acts as a disinfectant, which kills both the colony-threatening pathogen and the pupae.",
      "For the new research, the scientists wanted to figure out whether the pupae \"were actively saying: 'hey, come and kill me,'\" Dawson said.",
      "\"Altruistic act\"",
      "First, the scientists extracted the smell from the sick pupae of a small black garden ant called Lasius neglectus. When they applied the smell to a healthy brood in the lab, the workers still destroyed them.",
      "Then, the team conducted an experiment showing that the sick pupae only produce the smell when worker ants are nearby, proving it is a deliberate signal for destruction.",
      "\"While it is a sacrifice \u2014 an altruistic act \u2014 it's also in their own interest, because it means that their genes are going to survive and be passed on to the next generation,\" Dawson said.",
      "However, there is one member of the nest that does not sacrifice itself. When queen pupae are infected inside their cocoons, they do not send out the smelly warning signal, the team found.",
      "\"Are they cheating the system?\" Dawson said the team asked themselves.",
      "However, they found that the \"queen pupae have much better immune systems than the worker pupae, and so they were able to fight off the infection \u2014 and that's why we think that they weren't signaling,\" she said.",
      "The study's authors note that sick queens face a conundrum.",
      "\"By alerting others to destroy them, queen pupae would risk losing potential future reproductive opportunities if they would survive infection,\" the authors write. \"On the other hand, by spreading their infection to their colony, they could incur high indirect fitness costs.\"",
      "Dawson hopes future research will investigate whether queen pupae sacrifice themselves when it becomes clear they will not beat their infection.",
      "The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "Scientists have previously studied\u00a0how ants communicate. A Stanford University study\u00a0published\u00a0in 2012 showed that harvester ants transmit information to determine how many ants to send to a particular food source.

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 14:20:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Samples collected from the asteroid Bennu are continuing the shed light on the origins of the solar system and how life developed on Earth, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Samples taken from\u00a0the asteroid Bennu\u00a0are continuing to shed light on the origins of the solar system.",
      "Scientists have been studying the samples since NASA's Osiris-REx spacecraft carried them back to Earth in 2020 and recently discovered that that they contain sugars and \"a gum-like substance not seen before in astromaterials,\" NASA said.",
      "The revelations \u2014 and how they can help answer big questions about the beginnings of life \u2014 are described in three new papers published Tuesday by the journals Nature Geosciences and Nature Astronomy.",
      "In the first paper, scientists led by Yoshihiro Furukawa of Japan's Tohoku University focus on sugars uncovered in the asteroid samples, which are characterized as essential building blocks for biology on Earth. The second, by Scott Sandford at NASA's Ames Research Center and Zack Gainsforth of the University of California at Berkeley, reveals that the ancient \"space gum\" also present in the samples could have played a foundational role in catalyzing early life on our planet.",
      "The third paper, led by Ann Nguyen of NASA's Johnson Space Center, analyzed dust from two different types of rock that Osiris-REx collected from Bennu, which initially came from stars that predate the solar system.",
      "Ingredients for existence",
      "Each of the three papers zeroes in on a clue from the Bennu asteroid as to how the solar system developed and how life on Earth eventually came to be.",
      "The sugars discovered in the asteroid samples, along with other molecules like amino acids previously detected in them, do not necessarily provide evidence of life, NASA said. But they do show that fundamental elements of the compounds that make up living organisms and allow biological processes to happen within individual cells were, at least at one time, widespread throughout the solar system. Some of the basic molecules used to construct DNA \u2014 and RNA, a vital messenger that codes and decodes genetic information \u2014 were found in the samples from Bennu, researchers said.",
      "Furukawa said the sugars found in the Bennu samples support a hypothesis about the survival mechanisms used by the first forms of earthly life, which may have relied primarily on the messenger molecule rather than the complicated biological processes that ground it today.",
      "\"Present day life is based on a complex system,\" he said. \"However, early life may have been simpler.\"",
      "The mysterious \"space gum\" never seen in cosmic rocks before its discovery in the Bennu samples likely formed in the solar system's infancy, NASA said. According to the agency, the molecules it contains \"could have provided some of the chemical precursors that helped trigger life on Earth.\"",
      "The gum is an important piece of the puzzle for scientists studying how life on the planet began and whether it exists elsewhere.",
      "\"With this strange substance, we're looking at, quite possibly, one of the earliest alterations of materials that occurred in this rock,\" said Sandford, who co-led the paper on Bennu's surprising gum. \"On this primitive asteroid that formed in the early days of the solar system, we're looking at events near the beginning of the beginning.\"",
      "Some of the new research also examines the formation of Bennu itself, which, like other asteroids in the solar system, is a rock left over from the system's nascent stage. The dust discovered in two samples from the asteroid is a substance that scientists believe was already well-mixed when the solar system formed, according to NASA. Because such high concentrations of it were detected in the samples, Bennu may have developed in a region \"enriched in the dust of dying stars,\" the agency said.",

      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued after a powerful solar flare over the weekend.",
      "The solar flare peaked at 9:49 p.m. EST on Sunday, November 30, said NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, which constantly monitors the sun. The flare was classified as X1.9 flare, the space agency said. X-classes are the most intense kind of flare. The eruption came from a newly emerging sunspot region.",
      "The flare briefly knocked out radio communications across Australia and parts of southeast Asia on Tuesday, Space.com reported.",
      "A coronal mass ejection, or CME, also occurred. During CMEs, solar material and magnetic fields erupt from the sun. CMEs and solar flares are similar, but they are distinct phenomena, NASA said.",
      "Flares and CMEs can impact radio communications, power grids and navigation signals, NASA said. They can also pose a risk to spacecraft and astronauts. When CMEs reach Earth, they can cause geomagnetic storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center.",
      "A geomagnetic storm watch has been issued for Thursday, December 4. The CME is not expected to reach Earth, but can still have minor impacts including \"manageable effects to some technological infrastructure,\" NOAA said. There is some unpredictability in the forecast, NOAA noted, so the storm could arrive as early as December 3.",
      "The Northern Lights may be visible in northern and upper states between New York and Idaho. Weather forecasts, including a powerful winter storm, may limit the chances of seeing the phenomenon.",
      "Scientists may see more space weather activity between December 1 and December 5, NOAA said, as the sun's newly emerging sunspot region rotates to face the Earth. The sunspot, labeled AR4299, is where the recent flare and CME originated from.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 06:44:21 -0500",
    "summary": "India's government, amid an uproar over privacy, has revoked an order quietly issued to smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run security app.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "summary": "Children and adolescents who own smartphones by age 12 have higher risks of depression, poor sleep and obesity, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Having a smartphone may be harmful for children younger than 12, according to a new study.",
      "The study published Monday in the peer-reviewed journal\u00a0Pediatrics\u00a0found that owning a smartphone during early adolescence is associated with increased risks of mental health issues and obesity. As far as psychological impacts, it pinpointed higher incidences of depression and insufficient sleep among children who owned smartphones by ages 12 or younger, compared with others kids without the devices.",
      "Researchers at Children's Hospital Philadelphia, the University of California at Berkeley, and Columbia University arrived at those conclusions after analyzing data from more than 10,000 adolescents around the United States who participated in the\u00a0Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study\u00a0(ABCD) between 2018 and 2020. That study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, describes itself as \"the largest long-term study of brain development and child health\" in the country.",
      "According to researchers, 63.6% of the ABCD study's participants owned a smartphone, and the median age they received them was at 11 years old. Using that data, the researchers determined that younger children had greater risks than older participants of poor sleep or obesity linked to smartphone ownership, with increasingly worse health outcomes reported for kids the younger they were when they received their first smartphone.",
      "\"We didn't even look at what the kids did on the phone,\" Ran Barzilay, the lead author of the study and a child psychiatrist with the Youth Suicide Prevention, Intervention and Research Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CBS News. \"We basically asked one simple question: does the mere factor of having one's own smartphone at this age range have anything to do with health outcomes?\"",
      "The Pediatrics study also compared children who had obtained a smartphone by age 12 and children who had not, and found that one year later, those without smartphones were experiencing better mental health than those who had them.",
      "\"We did account for the fact that the kids may have had other technological devices like tablets or iPads, and it did not change the results,\" Barzilay said in an interview on CBS News' \"The Daily Report.\"",
      "In a separate\u00a0statement, Barzilay said his study's findings suggest that parents should see smartphones as having \"a significant factor in teen health\" and approach the decision to give children a phone with care and consideration. He noted that smartphones \"can play a constructive role\" in teens' lives by strengthening their social connections and helping them learn, adding that some families see smartphones as necessary for their children's safety.",
      "Going forward, Barzilay said the researchers behind the study hope to investigate which aspects of smartphone use and ownership are connected with negative health effects for young people. Researchers intend to study younger children, who acquired smartphones before age 10, in an effort to understand who is most vulnerable to the detrimental impacts of smartphone use who and who could most benefit from it. Ultimately, Barzilay said the goal is to identify ways to protect children and adolescents who own smartphones from the consequences outlined in their findings.",
      "In recent years, a growing number of experts have sounded the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating\u00a0\"tech-free zones\"\u00a0and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile,\u00a0several states\u00a0have taken steps to\u00a0ban cellphones\u00a0in schools.",
      "According to\u00a0Pew Research Center, 95% of teens between the ages of 13 and 17 owned a smartphone in 2024. More than half of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 12 who were surveyed by the research center at that time said their kids also owned smartphones. The same survey found that nearly 30% of parents with children between 8 and 10 years old said their kids owned smartphones, as did 12% of parents with children between 5 and 7 years old, and 8% of parents with children younger than 5.",
      "\"Most probably, all teens will eventually have a smartphone,\" said Barzilay. \"Once this happens, it is advisable to monitor what our children do on their phones, ensuring they're not exposed to inappropriate content and that smartphones don't disrupt sleep.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:35:08 -0500",
    "summary": "Texas approved a new congressional map this summer after Trump urged state GOP lawmakers to craft new House district lines to help Republicans hold onto their majority in the 2026 midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday restored for now Texas' newly redrawn congressional map that could give Republicans five additional House seats, after a lower court found that some of the new voting lines were racially discriminatory.",
      "The high court appeared to split 6-3. It said in an unsigned order that it \"has repeatedly emphasized that lower federal courts should ordinarily not alter the election rules on the eve of an election,\" and the district court \"violated that rule here.\"",
      "\"The District Court improperly inserted itself into an active primary campaign, causing much confusion and upsetting the delicate federal-state balance in elections,\" the Supreme Court said.",
      "The court wrote that \"based on our preliminary evaluation of this case,\" Texas was likely to succeed on the merits of its arguments that the district court merits committed \"at least two serious errors\" when it found the new map to be an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented from the ruling and said that the lower court had sought to determine whether Texas had accomplished \"its partisan objectives by means of a racial gerrymander enacting an electoral map slanted toward Republicans\" and found that Texas \"largely divided its citizens along racial lines to create its new pro-Republican House map, in violation of the Constitution's Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\"",
      "\"The court issued a 160-page opinion recounting in detail its factual findings,\" Kagan added. \"Yet this Court reverses that judgment based on its perusal, over a holiday weekend, of a cold paper record.\" Kagan was referring here to the Supreme Court's emergency docket, also known as the\u00a0shadow docket. The term refers to the orders and summary decisions issued by the Court without the full briefing and oral argument that accompanies cases on the regular docket.",
      "\"We are a higher court than the District Court, but we are not a better one when it comes to making such a fact-based decision,\" Kagan said.",
      "The decision from the high court is a boon to House Republicans and President Trump \u2014 who has pushed numerous GOP-led states to undertake a rare mid-decade redistricting in an effort to ensure his party holds onto its majority in the House.",
      "That plan was temporarily derailed last month when a divided panel of three judges blocked Texas from using its re-crafted House map for the 2026 election cycle and found that certain districts were racially gerrymandered.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, swiftly asked the Supreme Court to intervene, and Justice Samuel Alito temporarily reinstated the map while the full court considered the request. The high court has now agreed to block the lower court's decision, allowing Texas to use the new district lines for next year's House elections.",
      "Abbott celebrated the high court's decision in a statement, writing: \"We won! Texas is officially\u2014and legally\u2014more red.\"",
      "\"The new congressional districts better align our representation in Washington D.C. with the values of our state,\" the governor said. \"This is a victory for Texas voters, for common sense, and for the U.S. Constitution.\"",
      "Texas state House Democratic Leader Rep. Gene Wu said in a statement, \"The Supreme Court failed Texas voters today, and they failed American democracy. This is what the end of the Voting Rights Act looks like: courts that won't protect minority communities even when the evidence is staring them in the face.\"",
      "The move by Texas Republicans to draw new House district lines over the summer kicked off a redistricting fight that has extended to numerous other states. Mr. Trump and White House aides had been pushing GOP lawmakers in Texas to create a new map to bolster Republicans' chances of maintaining their majority in the House, and Abbott called a special session to tackle the issue.",
      "In the wake of that decision, California swiftly moved to redraw its congressional map to net up to five seats for Democrats, offseting the new GOP-leaning seats in Texas. GOP state lawmakers in North Carolina and Missouri have also approved plans that each seek to shift a single Democratic-held seat to the right. Those efforts have also faced legal challenges.",
      "In Texas, six groups of plaintiffs challenged the redrawn House districts and asked a three-judge district court panel to prohibit the state from using the new boundaries in the 2026 elections. The district court divided 2-1 in concluding that Texas racially gerrymandered its map and ordered the state to use for next year's House elections voting boundaries that were enacted by the GOP-led state legislature in 2021.",
      "In an opinion authored by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in showing that race predominated over politics in the map-making process and that the legislature set and followed a racial target.",
      "\"The public perception of this case is that it's about politics. To be sure, politics played a role in drawing the 2025 Map,\" Brown, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump in 2019, wrote. \"But it was much more than just politics. Substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.\"",
      "Texas officials turned to the Supreme Court for emergency relief, arguing that map-makers sought to achieve certain partisan goals to give Republicans a political advantage.",
      "\"This summer, the Texas Legislature did what legislatures do: politics,\" they wrote in a filing. \"It redistricted the State's 38 congressional districts mid-decade to secure five additional Republican seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.\"",
      "Texas officials also argued that the district court's injunction came too late \u2014 the filing period for congressional candidates opened 10 days before its decision and ends Dec. 8 \u2014 and disrupted the state's election procedures, risking confusion for candidates and voters. The state invoked a legal principle that generally keeps courts from changing election rules too close to an election in order to avoid confusing voters and election officials.",
      "\"The injunction changes the boundaries of all but one of the State's 38 congressional districts, enjoining Texas from using its duly enacted 2025 map and resurrecting the repealed 2021 map,\" they wrote. \"The chaos caused by such an injunction is obvious: campaigning had already begun, candidates had already gathered signatures and filed applications to appear on the ballot under the 2025 map, and early voting for the March 3, 2026, primary was only 91 days away.\"",
      "The district court's order, Texas officials, said, has \"thrown the election into disarray.\"",
      "But lawyers for the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC, which is the lead plaintiff, said that maintaining the status quo, which is the 2021 map, will prevent voter confusion, while reinstating the latest redistricting plan will force more than 10 million Texas voters into new House districts.",
      "Additionally, they said that keeping the 2021 map in place will allow incumbent lawmakers to campaign in the same districts they were elected to represent in 2024.",
      "\"All candidates for Congress will run in the districts they thought they were running in until 13 weeks ago when the Texas Legislature enacted a new map,\" LULAC lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They argued that race was the predominant factor that drove the map-drawing process this summer, and the legislature targeted multi-racial districts specifically because of their racial composition. LULAC lawyers accused state lawmakers of \"purposefully\" sorting voters on the basis of race to meet racial targets.",
      "The Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to let Texas use its new congressional map for the 2026 election cycle because what's at issue is an \"openly avowed partisan gerrymander.\" The Supreme Court in 2019 said federal courts have no role to play in partisan gerrymandering.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing there is \"overwhelming evidence\" that Texas lawmakers were motivated by partisan objectives.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:15:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Federal prosecutors on Thursday presented an indictment of New York Attorney General Letitia James to a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "Federal grand jurors declined to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James\u00a0on Thursday, a U.S. official said, marking another blow to the government's case after a judge tossed out the Justice Department's bank fraud charges against the Trump foe last week.",
      "The grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia, voted down an indictment after it was presented by federal prosecutors, the official said.",
      "Last week, a judge dismissed charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, was improperly appointed to her role. The judge gave the government the opportunity to re-charge them.",
      "It's extraordinarily rare for grand juries to decline to indict people.",
      "Federal prosecutors investigated more than 150,000 people in the 2016 fiscal year, and in only six cases reported not bringing charges because the grand jury voted down an indictment, according to Justice Department figures.",
      "James thanked the grand jury in a statement Thursday, writing: \"As I have said from the start, the charges against me are baseless. It is time for this unchecked weaponization of our justice system to stop.\"",
      "Her attorney, Abbe Lowell, said the case \"should never have existed in the first place,\" and warned that if the government continues to try to prosecute James, \"it will be a shocking assault on the rule of law and a devastating blow to the integrity of our justice system.\"",
      "The New York attorney general was initially charged in October with bank fraud and making a false statement to a financial institution. The Justice Department accused James of falsely claiming on mortgage documents that a house she bought in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia, would serve as her second home, when she actually rented it out and used it as an investment property. The government claims she was able to get a more favorable interest rate by calling it a second home.",
      "James has denied wrongdoing and argued the Trump administration is targeting her for political reasons. In between Mr. Trump's terms in the White House, James sued him in civil court for allegedly lying about the value of his real estate assets.",
      "In 2023, a judge ruled Mr. Trump, his family and his company \"repeatedly\" violated fraud law and imposed a nine-figure judgment against them in the case brought by James. An appeals court threw out the financial penalties earlier this year, calling them \"excessive.\" The appellate judges were divided on the merits of the case and did not strike down some non-financial penalties, including restrictions on the Trump Organization.",
      "James's attorneys have argued the case against her should be tossed out due to vindictive prosecution and \"outrageous government conduct.\" They've argued the charges stemmed from Mr. Trump's enmity toward James \u2014 pointing to a Truth Social post in which the president urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into her \u2014 and were the product of \"unethical behavior\" by several officials at the Justice Department and the Fair Housing Finance Authority.",
      "Halligan's office sought charges against Comey and James following upheaval in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Her predecessor as the office's top prosecutor, Erik Siebert, resigned in late September amid fears among staff that he would be forced out for refusing to charge James, CBS News has previously reported. Days later, Halligan \u2014 a former White House staffer and personal attorney to Mr. Trump \u2014 was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney. Comey was indicted less than a week after that, and James was indicted a few weeks later.",
      "Both Comey and James argued that Halligan was not legally appointed to her role, and asked for their charges to be tossed out. U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie dismissed their indictments without prejudice, meaning the government could attempt to indict them again.",
      "It's unclear whether the Justice Department will also try to re-indict Comey for allegedly lying to Congress in 2020 since the statute of limitations for those charges expired in late September. A federal law gives the government a six-month extension when indictments are dismissed after the statute of limitations for a case expires, but Currie wrote in her order that the law may not apply in Comey's case because the indictment may not have been valid to begin with.",

    "summary": "Rents in the 50 largest cities have surged by hundreds of dollars per month over the last five years, a LendingTree analysis found.",
    "story": [
      "If buying a home today is\u00a0financially out of reach\u00a0for many Americans, affording the rent may also seem like an increasingly tall order.",
      "In the 50 largest U.S. cities, the rent for a one-bedroom apartment climbed an average of $457 per month, or 41%, to $1,578\u00a0between 2020 and 2025, according to a recent\u00a0study\u00a0from loan marketplace LendingTree. Two-bedroom rents have surged an average of $505, or 37%, to roughly $1,858 per month over the same period.",
      "Since 2019, rents nationally have risen\u00a01.5 times faster than wages on average, according to a 2024\u00a0report\u00a0from online real estate brokers Zillow and StreetEasy.",
      "\"If your income is rising at the same time your rent is, maybe that extra expense is no big deal,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in the report. \"However, so many Americans' financial wiggle room is tiny, even in the best of times, so having to carve out hundreds of extra dollars to pay rent each month can be a big deal.\"",
      "Several factors explain why rents have surged, said Rob Bhatt, a consumer finance analyst at LendingTree. Perhaps most importantly, during the pandemic legions of newly remote workers moved to new markets, driving up rent\u00a0and housing prices.",
      "\"All the things that we saw during the pandemic have created stresses on the system, including stresses in these markets that traditionally haven't been renters' markets, and so it's going to take a little bit of time to adjust,\" he told CBS News.",
      "High home prices and rising mortgage rates, which have kept a lid on the number of homes coming to market, have also left more renters competing for a limited stock of affordable housing. Rents are projected to ease nationally next year, but only by 1%, according to a recent study from Realtor.com.",
      "Where have rents risen the most?",
      "New York, San Diego and Miami have seen the largest monthly rental increases for both one-bedroom units \u2014 which rose $854, $817 and $764 in the three cities, respectively, since 2020 \u2014 and two-bedroom units, which have jumped $857, $877 and $885, respectively, over the last five years.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 cities where one-bedroom rents have risen the most over the last five years, according to LendingTree (see chart below for a listing of the change in rents for the top 50 cities):",
      "Riverside, Calif.Tampa, Fla.Sacramento, Calif.AtlantaOrlando, Fla.BostonPhoenix",
      "Riverside, Calif.",
      "Tampa, Fla.",
      "Sacramento, Calif.",
      "Atlanta",
      "Orlando, Fla.",
      "Boston",
      "Phoenix",
      "In New York and San Diego, the spike in rents is attributable mostly to the demand for housing exceeding supply, according to LendingTree. Renters in those metro areas face limited inventory and plenty of competition.",
      "LendingTree attributed the surge in rental prices in Miami to the local population boom, noting that strong domestic and international migration to the area has driven up demand.",
      "One high-priced city where rent increases have cooled is San Francisco. The cost of a one-bedroom unit in the city rose $54 a month, to an average of $2,977, over the last five years, while two-bedrooms rose $51 to $3,604, LendingTree found.",
      "Other cities where rents are growing more slowly are Birmingham, Ala.; Oklahoma City, Okla.; San Antonio, Texas; and St. Louis, Mo.",

    "summary": "\"What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" Democratic Rep. Jim Himes said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Military officials showed lawmakers video of a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and testified that there was no order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to kill everyone on board, multiple lawmakers said.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, briefed the leaders of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees for both the House and the Senate. The classified briefings centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the\u00a0Sept. 2 follow-on strike\u00a0that has become a flashpoint in Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has been under fire since the Washington Post reported that a second missile killed two survivors of the initial strike. Hegseth has said the decision to strike the boat again was made by Bradley, who was leading the mission. The survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, spoke with reporters after the briefings. They both said Bradley told them that he had not been ordered to leave no survivors. The\u00a0initial Post report\u00a0quoted an anonymous source as saying that, before the first strike, Hegseth verbally ordered that everyone on the boat be taken out. \"The order was to kill everybody,\" the Post's story quoted the source as saying. Hegseth has denied the Post's account.",
      "The lawmakers also said they were shown the video of the second attack, which has not been made public. Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "\"You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States,\" Himes said.",
      "\"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors \u2014 bad guys, bad guys \u2014 but attacking shipwrecked sailors,\" Himes added. \"Now there's a whole set of contextual items that the admiral explained \u2014 yes, they were carrying drugs. They were not in the position to continue their mission in any way. People will someday see this video, and they will see that that video shows, if you don't have the broader context, an attack on shipwrecked sailors.\"",
      "President Trump said Wednesday that he would support releasing the footage.",
      "Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, refuted Himes' characterization of the video after his briefing, saying he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it.\"",
      "Cotton said the four strikes on Sept. 2 were \"entirely lawful and needful, and they were exactly what we'd expect our military commanders to do.\"",
      "\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight, and potentially, given all the context we've heard of other narco-terrorist boats in the area coming to their aid to recover the cargo and recover those narco-terrorists,\" Cotton said.",
      "Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee and was also briefed, told reporters, \"I think it'd be hard to watch this series of videos and not be troubled,\" and said he has \"more policy questions than ever\" about the mission.",
      "Coons said there were certain aspects of the briefing that he found more reassuring concerning process and intelligence, but \"more broadly, what we are asking the men and women of our armed forces, and particularly the special forces, to do, I think still lacks clear justification.\"",
      "\"The underlying judgment that frames this entire operation is that if there is a boat with narcotics and people who are affiliated with a narcotics trafficking organization, that that's a legitimate target,\" Coons said. \"I've still got questions about that.\"",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he was \"deeply disturbed by what I saw this morning,\" and called for the Pentagon to release the footage of the second strike.",
      "\"This briefing confirmed my worst fears about the nature of the Trump Administration's military activities, and demonstrates exactly why the Senate Armed Services Committee has repeatedly requested\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and been denied\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fundamental information, documents, and facts about this operation. This must and will be the only beginning of our investigation into this incident.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also called the video \"very disturbing\" and said all members of Congress should see it. But Warner declined to weigh in on the legality or morality of it.",
      "GOP Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement after the briefings that there is \"no doubt in my mind about the highly professional manner in which the Department of War conducted, and is conducting the operations our nation has called them to do to protect the homeland.\"",
      "\"I am deeply concerned by the public statements made by others that seek to ignore the realities of targeting terrorists to score political points,\" he added.",
      "The strike has sparked bipartisan concern from lawmakers and vows to investigate. Though the administration has argued the follow-on strike was legal and justified, members of Congress and experts have questioned its legality, with accusations from some Democrats that it would constitute a war crime if the second strike targeted survivors.",
      "The strike was the first of the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere, which has now grown to more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. The attacks attracted scrutiny from lawmakers even before the Post's report, since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. The administration has argued it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes because it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations and U.S. troops are not in harm's way.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 16:35:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Authorities say the FBI has arrested a man suspected of placing pipe bombs outside RNC and DNC headquarters on the eve of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.",
    "story": [
      "A northern Virginia man was arrested and accused of placing two pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, federal authorities announced Thursday.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi identified the suspect as Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old from Woodbridge, Virginia, located just outside Washington, D.C. Cole was charged with use of an explosive device, Bondi said, adding that more charges were possible in the investigation, which was still active and ongoing. He's the first suspect arrested in the yearslong pipe bomb investigation.",
      "Cole lives with his mother and other family members in Woodbridge and works in a bail bondsman's office, an FBI agent said in court documents. The school district for Prince William County, Virginia, which includes Woodbridge, confirmed to CBS News that Cole graduated from high school in 2013.",
      "Cole was arrested early Thursday morning and investigators were still executing search warrants in the afternoon, Bondi told reporters during a news conference.",
      "An unidentified FBI agent said in a probable cause affidavit filed Wednesday that Cole allegedly bought multiple items in 2019 and 2020 that were consistent with the components used to make the pipe bombs.",
      "According to the affidavit, cellphone provider records show that Cole's phone was located in the vicinity of the DNC and RNC headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021, when the person who planted the bombs was seen on surveillance footage. Cole's car was also spotted by a license plate reader less than half a mile from where the person was seen on the footage, the document states.",
      "The court documents don't make any references to the Capitol riot that took place the following day. During Thursday's news conference, Bondi didn't provide details about the suspect's possible motive.",
      "\"Right now, it's ongoing,\" she said. \"Again, we just executed the search warrant early, early this morning. It's ongoing, but America's safer, D.C.'s safer because he's in custody.\"",
      "Bondi told reporters no new tip or witness emerged that led to Thursday's arrest and that the development was the result of going over evidence that was already in the FBI's possession.",
      "\"Today's arrest happened because the Trump administration has made this case a priority,\" Bondi said. \"The total lack of movement on this case in our nation's capital undermined the public trust of our enforcement agencies.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said a team of experts reevaluated the evidence, describing them as \"the best at what they do in their specific fields.\"",
      "\"When you develop evidence, you get a search warrant, and when you get a search warrant, you get an address, and when you get an address, you hit the house, and that's what we did,\" Patel said.",
      "The arrest marks a major step forward in a case that has vexed the FBI for nearly five years.  The pipe bombs were placed outside DNC and RNC headquarters on the evening of Jan. 5, federal investigators have said.",
      "The devices \u2014 made out of 1x8-inch pipes, kitchen timers and homemade black powder \u2014 did not detonate, but the FBI has called them viable and warned they could have killed or injured people.",
      "The bombs were not discovered until the afternoon of Jan. 6, as police in the area were overwhelmed by rioting at the Capitol building nearby. Former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the vice president-elect at the time, was evacuated from the DNC headquarters shortly after the devices were found.",
      "\"We are grateful to the law enforcement officers who have dedicated years to investigating the pipe bombs planted at the Democratic and Republican National Committee headquarters on the eve of the January 6th insurrection,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said following the arrest. \"Those responsible for this horrific act must be brought to justice, and political violence should never be accepted in America.\"",
      "Over the subsequent months and years, federal law enforcement scoured the country for alleged Capitol riot participants, tracking down and charging more than 1,500 people.",
      "But the pipe bomb case had remained a lingering mystery amid the events of that week. The FBI had not made an arrest or identified a suspect before Thursday, though it has periodically released footage of a potential suspect \u2014 grainy security camera images of a shadowy figure in a hoodie \u2014 and offered $500,000 for information.",
      "In May, Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino said on X the pipe bomb investigation was one of several unsolved cases that had drawn \"additional resources and investigative attention.\" He said he had received weekly briefings on the case and the FBI was \"making progress.\"",
      "Nick  Kurtz and \n                                                  \n                                  Kathryn  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The layoffs represent a 54% increase from the same period a year earlier, when employers cut 761,358 jobs, according to the firm. It's also only the sixth time since 1993 that job cuts during the first 11 months of the year have risen above 1.1 million.",
      "Here's what is driving the increase in 2025 layoffs, according to Challenger.",
      "Tech is driving the surge in job cuts",

      "Layoffs from the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were a primary driver of job cuts, leading to nearly 300,000 job losses this year, according to the Challenger report. DOGE, a cost-cutting effort, reduced both funding and employment at some federal agencies earlier this year.",
      "DOGE accounted for another 21,000 indirect job cuts at private and nonprofit entities that lost federal funding.",

      "Artificial intelligence advances accounted for 54,700 job cuts, while tariffs were cited for nearly 8,000. President Trump's levies on trade partners have raised costs for companies, prompting some to trim spending elsewhere, including on labor.",
      "Small businesses, which operate on thin margins, say the tariffs have hit them especially hard. New\u00a0data from payroll firm ADP\u00a0shows that private-sector employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, driven largely by firms with fewer than 50 employees. These smaller employers have borne the brunt of rising costs and ongoing policy uncertainty.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth jeopardized sensitive military information that could have endangered American service members when he shared certain details about U.S. military operations in Yemen in a private Signal group chat earlier this year, according to a report\u00a0the Pentagon's inspector general released Thursday morning.",
      "The report found the former Fox News host-turned-defense secretary violated Defense Department policies when he used his personal device for official business to transmit sensitive U.S. military information to other top Trump officials and the editor in chief of The Atlantic magazine. CBS News reported the key findings of the report ahead of its release based on multiple sources.",
      "\"Using a personal cell phone to conduct official business and send nonpublic DoD information through Signal risks potential compromise of sensitive DoD information, which could cause harm to DoD personnel and mission objectives,\" the report said.",
      "The report also said Hegseth's \"actions created a risk to operational security that could have resulted in failed U.S. mission objectives and potential harm to U.S. pilots.\"",
      "A classified version of the inspector general's report was sent to Congress on Tuesday. An unredacted version was released Thursday.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the review \"is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along - no classified information was shared. This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.\"",
      "Hegseth also called the review a \"total exoneration,\" writing on X: \"No classified information. Total exoneration. Case closed. Houthis bombed into submission. Thank you for your attention to this IG report.\"",
      "The report said that while Hegseth has the authority to declassify information as secretary, \"based on our review, we concluded that some information from the secretary sent from his personal cell phone on Signal on March 15, 2025, matched the operational information USCENTCOM sent and classified as SECRET/NOFORN.\" CBS News previously\u00a0reported\u00a0on the classified source of information and that it had been shared by Army Gen. Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, who at the time was the commander of U.S. Central Command, the primary combatant unit overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East, Central Asia and parts of South Asia.",
      "According to U.S. Central Command's Security Classification Guide, the operational movement of aircraft should be classified as SECRET, the report found. However, the secretary of defense is authorized to declassify information as appropriate.",
      "The \"SECRET\" designation means the information was classified, and the disclosure of the information without proper declassification could potentially cause serious damage to national security and jeopardize the safety of service members, according to the U.S. government.",
      "The \"NOFORN\" label means the information can only be disseminated to U.S. agencies and individuals, excluding foreign nationals and even close U.S. allies.",
      "Hegseth declined to be interviewed for the report, the inspector general said, opting instead to respond to questions in writing.",
      "The secretary did not provide his personal cell phone to the IG, according to the report. His office did provide some messages that matched those published in the Atlantic, but excluded \"a number of messages that had auto-deleted by the time the information was captured from the Secretary's phone because of settings in the chat.\"",
      "The IG was told Hegseth posted the same information in separate Signal chats, so the IG requested copies of messages from other group chats. Because the IG did not have access to Hegseth's phone, he was not \"able to verify whether any of the additionally identified Signal chats also contained sensitive, classified, or other nonpublic DoD information.\"",
      "The sources familiar with the inspector general's investigation said the report found that if the information had been intercepted by a foreign adversary, it would have clearly endangered U.S. service members and the mission.",
      "A day after the Signal chat story was published by The Atlantic, U.S. Africa Command, in coordination with the government of Somalia, conducted multiple airstrikes against affiliates of the Islamic State terrorist organization. A press release said the airstrikes occurred near the Golis Mountains in Somalia and that multiple \"ISIS-Somalia operatives were killed.\"",
      "After multiple Trump administration officials claimed the information in the Signal chat group was unclassified, CBS News filed a request in March under the Freedom of Information Act to U.S. Africa Command to see if similar information deemed unclassified by Hegseth from the Yemen airstrike could be released regarding the March 25 airstrike on the ISIS operatives in Somalia.",
      "CBS News requested information about the airstrike that was similar to the information appearing in the Signal chat group about the strikes and that Trump intelligence officials had said was unclassified.",
      "In early September, CBS News received a response from U.S. Africa Command, which arrived at the same conclusion as the Pentagon inspector general about the Somalia airstrike \u2014 that the material if released could jeopardize national security.",

Gen. Matthew Trollinger, the chief of staff to Air Force Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson, the commander of U.S. Africa Command, wrote in his letter to CBS News.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the IG's review \"affirms what the Administration has said from the beginning \u2014 no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.\"",
      "She went on to say, \"The President's entire national security team is doing great work advancing American interests while protecting sensitive information,\" adding, \"President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth.\"",
      "In separate statements on Wednesday, the top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees called for Hegseth to resign.",
      "Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said the report \"notes that the IG is aware of several other Signal chats Hegseth used for official business, underscoring that this was not an isolated lapse. It reflects a broader pattern of recklessness and poor judgment from a secretary who has repeatedly shown he is in over his head.\"",
      "\"Pete Hegseth's behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,\" Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said. \"What's more, his refusal to sit for an interview with the Inspector General or submit his device for examination is yet another example of his failure to take responsibility for his actions.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, a veteran who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CBS News in an interview that the report showed \"a jaw-dropping breach of our national security, and Hegseth needs to resign immediately.\"",
      "\"When you tell somebody that 30 minutes after the drone strikes, our aircraft will be on position at this location, that's classified information in the f---ing middle of an operation. You're telling the enemy, 'hey, by the way, 30 minutes after the drones hit, be ready to shoot our aircraft out of the sky, because they're going to be there.' That's classified operational information,\" Duckworth said. \"And this argument that Hegseth has the authority just by sharing it, he declassified, it doesn't make it right. It just means that they're trying to cover their asses.\"",

      "The overhaul also applies to immigrants with pending applications for asylum or permanent U.S. residency, known as green cards. Those processes that usually take years to complete, mainly because of a massive backlog of unresolved cases.",
      "Under the new rules, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said it will issue work permits to these populations that last for a maximum of 18 months, instead of the current 5-year period.",
      "In its announcement, USCIS cited the attack against two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., last week, arguing the change will allow the agency to vet and screen immigrants more frequently when they file to renew their work permits.",

    "summary": "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered it.",
    "story": [
      "Two people who survived the U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged drug-carrying vessel were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "The survivors allegedly tried to salvage some of the drugs, according to the source. They appeared to be in communication with others at the time, and there were other boats in the vicinity that could have picked them up, the head of Special Operations Command Admiral Mitch Bradley was expected to tell lawmakers on Thursday, the source said.",
      "ABC News was first to report the additional details on the strike. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reposted a video of ABC News' report on X.",
      "The Sept. 2 mission \u2014 the first of more than 20 attacks on alleged drug boats by the Trump administration in recent months \u2014 has drawn bipartisan scrutiny since last week, when The Washington Post reported that the military carried out at least two strikes on the same boat in the Caribbean, killing a pair of survivors from the initial hit. The newspaper alleged in its report that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth had said that everybody on board the boat should be killed.",
      "The White House confirmed this week that there was a second strike, but denied that Hegseth ordered it. Hegseth has said the decision was made by Bradley, the mission's commander, and argued the follow-up strike was legal and justified.",
      "Bradley and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, walked lawmakers through a video of the second strike in classified testimony on Thursday before the House and Senate Armed Services and Intelligence committees. Bradley testified that Hegseth didn't issue an order for everybody to be killed, multiple lawmakers later told reporters.",
      "Members of Congress offered divergent views on the video. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut called it \"one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" describing the two survivors as people \"in clear distress\" who were \"not in the position to continue their mission in any way.\" But Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it,\" adding the survivors appeared to be \"trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "Democrats and some legal experts have alleged the second strike may have constituted a war crime under U.S. and international law if the military targeted survivors. A Pentagon manual on the law of war says \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" combatants no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "Even before the recent revelations, the campaign of boat strikes had drawn broader legal questions, with critics arguing the president doesn't have the authority to order military operations against alleged traffickers without congressional approval. In the past, the U.S. has typically sought to interdict drug smugglers at sea, essentially treating them like criminals rather than combatants. The Trump administration has argued the strikes are lawful because the U.S. is engaged in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels that it views as terrorist organizations.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 15:14:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump suggested Americans won't have to pay personal income taxes \"in the not-too-distant future\" because of rising U.S. tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is floating an idea that could appeal to millions of budget-strained households: using tariff revenue to reduce, or even eliminate, the federal individual income tax. But tax experts are skeptical that import taxes could completely replace income tax, and they say a reduction in income taxes would largely benefit the nation's top earners.",
      "\"I believe that at some point in the not-too-distant future, you won't even have income tax to pay because the money we're taking in is so great,\" Mr. Trump said at a Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting, referring to the tariff revenues generated by the wide-ranging duties his administration has imposed on imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's suggestion comes as the Supreme Court is weighing the constitutionality of his tariffs, which are import taxes paid by U.S. companies that are typically passed partly on to American consumers in the form of higher prices. The Treasury Department this year has significantly boosted the country's collection of tariffs, thanks to Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is set to raise trillions in revenue for the federal government in the coming years with his tariffs \u2014 whose costs will ultimately be paid by the foreign exporters who rely on the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market.\"",
      "Despite the jump in tariff receipts, tax experts are skeptical that such revenue could ever replace individual income taxes.",
      "\"It is mechanically impossible to fully replace income tax revenues with tariffs,\" Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News. \"Any real attempt to do so would harm working-class Americans, damage the U.S. economy and significantly increase the federal budget deficit.\"",
      "York estimated the Trump administration's current tariff policy, assuming it remains in place, would generate about $2.1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. By comparison, federal individual income taxes would provide more than 10 times that amount, at $32 trillion over the same period, she said.",
      "Personal taxes provide about $2.7 trillion annually in federal revenue, according to IRS data. For fiscal year 2025, the U.S. generated $195 billion in tariff revenue, Treasury data\u00a0shows.",
      "\"Tariffs, even applied maximally, simply could not generate that level of revenue \u2014 imports are not a large enough tax base,\" York said.",
      "To be sure, tariff revenue could be used to provide a tax cut, said Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the nonpartisan Cato Institute. However, because low-income households already pay little to no income tax, it's unlikely to help the families most in need of a financial boost, he noted.",
      "\"If they did a flat 3% reduction in income tax, the only people who would really benefit are the top 10%\" of income earners, Lincicome said.",
      "The top 10% of earners pay about 72% of the nation's income taxes, according to Tax Foundation data.",
      "What about a tariff dividend?",
      "Mr. Trump has also discussed the possibility of sending Americans a $2,000 \"tariff dividend\" check, an idea he reiterated during the Dec. 2 Cabinet meeting.",
      "Yet that proposal also faces a troublesome math problem, Lincicome said. Sending a one-time $2,000 payment to U.S. households would cost between $300 billion and $600 billion \u2014 far more than the U.S. is currently collecting in tariffs, he pointed out.",
      "Issuing a tariff payment or reducing income taxes also would require Congress to change the tax code \u2014 a tall legislative task given the ongoing partisanship in Congress. Some Republican lawmakers have already rebuffed the idea of a $2,000 payment, with Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin recently\u00a0saying\u00a0the U.S. \"can't afford\" it.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.S. is unlikely to raise enough tariff revenue to fund dividend checks or replace the individual income tax because that would require import taxes so high that Americans would stop buying most imported goods, causing tariff revenue to collapse, Lincicome explained.",
      "\"There is a hard cap on the amount of money you can raise with tariffs,\" he added. Economists \"say you can maybe raise $700 billion a year, which would be a very high effective tax rate \u2014 an across-the-board 20% to 30% tariff rate \u2014 but if it's pushed above that, nobody would buy imports.\"",
      "The overall average effective tariff rate facing U.S. consumers is now nearly 17%, the highest level since 1935, according to the\u00a0Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "How do tariffs differ from income taxes?",
      "Setting aside the difference in the scale of revenue collection, tariffs are structured differently from income taxes. U.S. companies that import products, parts and other goods from abroad pay a fee based on the country of origin \u2014 for instance, American firms pay a 15% tariff on imports from the European Union.",
      "That means an American company importing a $5 Italian chocolate bar would pay the U.S. government an additional 75 cents, and then decide whether to pass that extra cost on to consumers or absorb it.",
      "Because of their structure, tariffs are often compared with sales taxes, where sellers pay a percentage of an item's cost when they check out at a store.",
      "By contrast, individual income taxes are progressive, meaning lower-income Americans pay a smaller tax rate than higher-earning households. The lowest bracket is 10%, while the top rate is 37%.",
      "Replacing the graduated income tax with a flat tariff rate would likely leave low- and middle-income households shouldering a bigger share of the burden than higher-income earners, York said.",
      "\"Tariffs are relatively flat, and even slightly regressive, placing a larger burden on working-class households than on the rich,\" she said. \"The income tax is the opposite \u2014 it is highly progressive and even provides negative income tax rates for the lowest income households.\"",
      "She added, \"Swapping a highly progressive income tax for a slightly regressive tariff scheme would harm the very households the president claims to be helping.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 13:39:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The CDC's vaccine advisory panel meets Thursday and Friday to discuss recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccine and the schedule of childhood shots.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory panel met Thursday for the first of two days of discussions about childhood vaccine schedules and recommendations. The panel is focusing on\u00a0the hepatitis B vaccine and plans to vote on whether to continue recommending it be given to all children at birth or delay the first dose.",
      "However, that vote was postponed until Friday amid confusion on the exact wording of the questions the committee was set to vote on.",
      "The hepatitis B vaccine has been universally recommended for newborns in the U.S. since 1991. Since then, research shows\u00a0hepatitis B infections among infants and children have dropped 99%.",
      "Hepatitis B is an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and early death.",
      "The shot has become a target of vaccine skeptics, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who falsely claimed on a podcast in June that the birth dose is a \"likely culprit\" in\u00a0autism. Kennedy has appointed all of the members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, during his tenure as HHS secretary.",
      "Here's what to know about the meetings and the hepatitis B vaccine.",
      "What happened at Thursday's ACIP meeting?",
      "The panel postponed until Friday its plans to vote on whether or not to continue recommending the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine be given within 24 hours of birth \u2014 known as the birth dose.",
      "At one point in Thursday's session, committee member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln said that the group had seen three different versions of questions to vote on in the past 72 hours. A technical issue prevented the new voting language from being put up on slides. The presentation was later moved to the end of the agenda, to be displayed just before the vote. There were questions of how many questions members would be asked to vote on. There were no hard copies of the language available.",
      "\"We're trying to evaluate a moving target,\" Hibbeln said.",
      "Similar confusion pervaded ACIP's September meeting, when\u00a0members admitted they didn't know what they were voting on when they rejected a combined measles-mumps-rubella-chickenpox vaccine before voting to keep it funded, then reversing the funding vote the next day.",
      "A motion to delay the vote until Friday morning was agreed upon by a 6-3 margin.",
      "The meeting was contentious at points. Vicky Pebsworth, the ACIP Childhood and Adolescent Immunization Schedule Workgroup Chair and a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, said in introductory remarks that the panel was reviewing the vaccine because of \"concerns raised by some groups.\"",
      "Panel members presented information on the prevalence of acute and chronic hepatitis B, and discussed transmission and safety data. Former board members and liaisons to medical organizations sharply criticized the presentations and said some data was mischaracterized.",
      "Dr. Jason Goldman, liaison to the ACIP for the American College of Physicians, called the meeting \"completely inappropriate\" and accused the panel of \"wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific, rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter.\" Goldman also highlighted that the hepatitis B birth dose is not mandated and that parents are encouraged to make decisions in consultation with their doctor.",
      "Why is the hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns?",
      "The hepatitis B virus is primarily transmitted through blood and bodily fluids and is highly contagious. The virus can also survive on surfaces for a week;\u00a0research shows\u00a0it can be transmitted through indirect contact with infected fluids.",
      "Hepatitis B can be passed from mother to child and can also be transmitted to infant children by caregivers, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Infected adults often have\u00a0few to no symptoms\u00a0and can spread it without even knowing they have the virus. The CDC has estimated that of the 2.4 million people in the U.S. with hepatitis B, about half\u00a0do not know\u00a0they are infected.",
      "When the hepatitis B vaccine is given to newborns soon after birth it is up to\u00a090% effective\u00a0at preventing infection from the mother. If babies receive the full three-dose vaccination series,\u00a098% of them\u00a0have immunity from the illness, according to the AAP.",
      "Newborns who become infected with hepatitis B at birth and infants who contract the virus within the first year of their life have a 90% chance of developing chronic hepatitis B, an illness that can cause life-threatening issues including cirrhosis, liver failure and liver cancer. About 25% of those patients end up dying prematurely as a result.",
      "Previously, prenatal screening for hepatitis B was targeted to women at higher risk, including those with multiple partners or who injected drugs, and the vaccine was only recommended for infants born to those who tested positive for the virus. But that approach failed to identify many infections, researchers found, and even with universal testing during pregnancy some \"leakage\" cases continued to occur.",
      "The CDC still recommends that pregnant women get tested for hepatitis B, but about 16% of expecting mothers fall through the cracks, according to the agency.",
      "\"The birth dose has served as a critical safety net in the U.S. healthcare system \u2014 to protect against gaps in prenatal screening, missed HBV [hepatitis B virus] diagnoses, communication errors, and inconsistent follow-up,\" according to the Vaccine Integrity Project of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Parents are not mandated to give their children the hepatitis B vaccine, though many schools and child care facilities currently require the shots.",
      "The birth dose and vaccine series have helped keep rates low in recent years. In 2021, CDC data showed about 17,827 children were born to mothers who tested positive for hepatitis B, but there were only 17 reported cases of newborns contracting the virus from their mothers that year, the AAP said. The pediatricians' organization credited the birth dose for that progress.",
      "What do experts say about the hepatitis B vaccine?",
      "Medical experts and organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association say extensive research shows that the hepatitis B vaccine is safe. It has a\u00a0long track record, and multiple studies show the shot is not associated with an increased risk of\u00a0infant death,\u00a0fever or sepsis,\u00a0multiple sclerosis\u00a0or\u00a0autoimmune conditions. Severe reactions to the vaccine are rare, with the\u00a0main adverse events\u00a0reported being crying and fussiness that pass quickly.",
      "\"The hepatitis B vaccine has ... one of the most well established safety records of any vaccine, and it's one of our best. We've been using it for a long time. It's one of our best tools to protect babies from chronic illness and liver cancer,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, told CBS News. \"This is a situation where one missed case is too many.\"",
      "As O'Leary put it to\u00a0KFF Health News: \"No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and who is also a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, says the at-birth vaccine dose has \"decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades.\" He said he was \"very concerned\" about a potential change in the recommendations.",
      "\"I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease,\" Cassidy said\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.\"",
      "On Thursday morning, as the ACIP meeting began, Cassidy criticized the panel on social media.",
      "\"The ACIP is totally discredited,\" he wrote. \"They are not protecting children.\"",
      "What can be expected at the ACIP meeting?",
      "The ACIP meeting will span two days. In addition to discussing and voting on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation, the panel will discuss childhood vaccine schedules. There is no vote planned for the latter topic.",
      "A vote about the hepatitis B vaccine was scheduled for Thursday, according to a meeting agenda, but later postponed until Friday. The agenda also included time for multiple presentations and discussions on the topic, as well as time for public comments.",
      "\"This week marks the third meeting of this revised, this new ACIP committee,\" O'Leary told CBS News, referring to the RFK Jr. appointees. \"The last few meetings have been deeply alarming, riddled with falsehoods, and I think unfortunately, we can expect the same with this meeting this week.\"",
      "The panel debated moving the birth dose to one month of age in their September meeting, but tabled the topic.",
      "What could happen if the hepatitis B vaccine recommendations are changed?",
      "The ACIP's recommendations go to the CDC director for approval and adoption as policy. Ultimately, decisions are left\u00a0to the states, which tend to base their policies off the CDC's guidelines but can choose\u00a0to set\u00a0their own. The panel's recommendations also carry weight with insurance companies. Most private insurers are required to cover vaccines recommended by the panel. If ACIP changes its recommendation, coverage for hepatitis B vaccines may change.",
      "Doctors say they're concerned that any decision to delay the first dose or weaken the recommendations would result in more infections \u2014 meaning more lives burdened by disease or cut short.",
      "\"Delaying the first hepatitis B vaccine dose beyond the newborn period introduces risks that have lifelong detrimental consequences and no measurable health benefit,\" three leading infectious disease specialists write in an article published Wednesday in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "They note that over the years, \"randomized trials, safety monitoring, and large cohort studies have consistently confirmed the vaccine's safety,\" and researchers say there is no evidence of any safety benefit in waiting until a child is a month old.",
      "\"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver,\" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP,\u00a0told KFF Health News. \"It's too late to prevent that infection.\"",
      "That would result in the virus circulating at higher rates and increase the risk of contracting it for everyone, Schaffner said. More hepatitis B cases would also mean higher costs for patients and the medical system overall.",
      "\"There's no reason to delay or space out vaccines,\" O'Leary\u00a0said. \"Doing so just puts children at risk.\"",

    "story": [
      "Contender, the largest white male shark tagged by the ocean research group OCEARCH, is on the move in the Atlantic Ocean, recently appearing near South Carolina.",
      "The shark, who weighs over 1,650 pounds and is nearly 14 feet long, was spotted just 105 miles off the coast of Charleston on Monday, OCEARCH said on social media. On Wednesday, he looked to be even closer to shore, according to tracking data shared by OCEARCH.",
      "Contender was\u00a0tagged by OCEARCH nearly a year ago in waters near where he's currently swimming. Since then, he has followed typical white shark migration patterns to spend the winter in warmer southern waters before migrating north for the summer. In late October, Contender began moving south again to spend another winter near Florida. He has traveled nearly 5,000 miles since he was first tagged.",
      "Other white sharks are following the same pattern, said OCEARCH data scientist John Tyminski in a video shared on social media. Among them are\u00a0Bella, a 700-pound white shark spotted near Virginia, and Penny, a 10-foot white shark who was still near southern New Jersey. Other sharks have already reached Florida's coast.",
      "While the sharks migrate over a wide area, they can often end up clustered in groups, Tyminski said. Contender and other sharks were likely drawn into \"a kind of white shark traffic jam\" by suitable environmental conditions and a bountiful food supply. During his last migration, Contender and other sharks lingered near the Outer Banks before moving up the coast.",
      "OCEARCH said at the time that the region is a \"common rest stop\" for the species, likely because of its food resources.",
      "Tracking the movements of Contender, Bella and other sharks and sea creatures gives OCEARCH \"valuable data on the lives of white sharks in the Northwest Atlantic,\" according to the organization. Each tag provides data for several years. The tag pings are publicly available\u00a0on OCEARCH's site.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday that Democrats will offer a clean three-year extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits for a vote next week, when the issue that was at the center of the shutdown fight comes center stage.",
      "\"This is the bill, a clean three-year extension of ACA tax credits, that Democrats will bring to the floor of the Senate for a vote next Thursday, and every single Democrat will support it,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday morning.",
      "The announcement comes after a group of Senate Democrats last month secured a vote to address the expiring tax credits as part of the deal to reopen the government. Millions of Americans are due to see their health insurance premiums skyrocket in the new year without action from Congress.",
      "Democrats had the opportunity to present the legislation of their choice. Some moderates sought a compromise position that would stand a chance at earning the 60 votes needed to advance. Schumer's decision to seek a clean extension means the bill is highly unlikely to pick up support from Republicans, although the move so will force GOP members to take a politically uncomfortable vote. Republicans rejected Schumer's offer of a clean extension toward the end of the government shutdown.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters of the possibility Wednesday that the approach \"suggests they're not really interested in fixing it.\" Senate Republicans have not yet determined whether they will offer up their own health care measure alongside the Democratic bill.",
      "\"We're still working it with our members, but we will have a plan,\" Thune told CBS News on Thursday. Senate Republicans have been circling a number of alternate proposals to address health care costs.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 10:44:49 -0500",
    "summary": "A new report from Realtor.com projects that the housing market will shift in a more buyer-friendly direction in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "It's still a tough time to get a foothold in the housing market, with homes sitting near record values and mortgage rates parked well above 6%. But the tide could turn in 2026, with property prices forecast to dip in 22 of the largest 100 U.S. cities and mortgage rates expected to ease slightly, according to a new analysis from\u00a0Realtor.com.",
      "The real estate market is expected to move in a more \"buyer-friendly\" direction next year, leading to the \"most balanced housing market\" since the pandemic, meaning that neither sellers nor buyers are likely to have the upper hand in negotiations, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Mortgage rates are expected to dip to an average of 6.3% next year, a slight drop from 2025's 6.6% average rate. Lower borrowing costs, as well as strong wage growth next year, should encourage more buyers to jump into the market, Krimmel added.",
      "\"2026 is going to be a year where we think the market is going to steady,\" Krimmel said. \"It's going to show a lot of signs of getting back on track to what we consider to be normal.\"",
      "That will help push up existing-home sales, which are projected to increase less than 2% to 4.13 million properties in 2026, according to Realtor.com's report. That's only a slight bump from this year's projected 4.07 million home sales, but a notable change given that transactions have been relatively flat throughout 2025.",
      "Zillow, another online real estate marketplace, also expects the housing market will ease for homebuyers as inventory grows and mortgage rates tick down. The company projects existing home sales will rise to nearly 4.3 million next year, up 4.3% from its projected total for 2025. Mortgage rates are likely to hover just above 6%, according to Zillow \u2014 higher than in recent years, but modest by historical standards.",
      "Where will prices drop?",
      "Most of the 22 cities where home prices are forecast to drop next year are located in the Southeast and the West. For instance, seven of the eight largest cities in Florida are projected to see declines in home prices next year, with the sole exception of Miami, the report said.",
      "The Cape Coral-Fort Lauderdale metropolitan area is expected to see the nation's largest price decline next year, with homes dropping by 10.2%, the analysis says. That's followed by the North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton, Florida region, with an 8.9% decline.",
      "The cities with projected price drops include those where inventory has expanded, providing more choices for buyers, Krimmel said. Some of those metropolitan areas may now also have lighter demand from buyers compared with the COVID-era\u00a0real estate boom, which was fueled by low mortgage rates and a shift to work-at-home policies.",
      "\"These places, among others, saw a huge frenzy during the pandemic, so part of what we are projecting is that demand continuing to come back down to earth,\" Krimmel told CBS News.",
      "Prices are expected to rise in the other 78 largest U.S. cities, but the hikes are likely to be small, with a median price gain of 4% across those locations.",
      "To make its projections,\u00a0Realtor.com\u00a0examined inventory, new construction, price growth, wage and job growth, and unemployment across the 100 cities.",

      "A safety volunteer accused of fatally shooting a man taking part in a \"No Kings\" protest last June in Salt Lake City while firing at another man he believed to be a potential mass shooter has been charged with manslaughter, prosecutors announced Wednesday.",
      "Matthew Alder allegedly fired three shots \u2014 one hitting a man who had been seen assembling an AR-15 rifle near the crowd and a third inadvertently killing the rally participant, Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, according to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill.",
      "Gill told reporters at a news conference that the facts surrounding this case were \"very nuanced and complex,\" with Utah's complicated gun laws among them. As CBS affiliate KUTV\u00a0reported, the district attorney said that the state requested a grand jury from a panel of five judges, in accordance with Utah's protocols, in order to bring charges. The panel denied the grand jury in early November, but Gill said a similar case in Massachusetts ultimately helped guide his office's next steps.",
      "While Alder had a right to use lethal force to stop a perceived threat and a right to carry a gun under Utah law, his third shot, fired over people's heads at a large gathering, was reckless and constituted a crime, Gill said.",
      "\"In this case our argument is that the third bullet was reckless and, if it is reckless, it is manslaughter,\" Gill said at a news conference. He noted that another safety volunteer with Alder did not think it was safe to open fire at the time because the man with the rifle was moving toward the crowd.",
      "An email and a telephone message left for Alder's lawyer, Phil Wormdahl, seeking comment were not immediately returned.",
      "Ah Loo, known as Afa, was a successful fashion designer and former \"Project Runway\" contestant who devoted his life to celebrating artists from the Pacific Islands.",
      "His widow, Laura Ah Loo, who has demanded accountability for her husband's death, said Gill's decision to charge Alder was \"moral and just.\" Fighting back tears, she described her husband as \"an incredible father, advocate, creative and champion for others.\"",
      "\"The grief of losing him has been profound and overwhelming,\" Ah Loo said.",
      "Utah is an open-carry state, meaning people who can legally own a firearm are generally allowed to carry it on a public street.",
      "The man who was seen assembling the rifle, Arturo Roberto Gamboa, was initially arrested on suspicion of murder and accused of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death, police said at the time.",
      "Gill said Gamboa would not be charged. In a letter explaining the decision, prosecutors noted there was not enough evidence to show Gamboa had broken any law even though his actions could \"reasonably be perceived as alarming and irresponsible.\"",
      "A telephone message left for Gamboa's lawyer was not immediately returned.",
      "The lawyer, Greg Skordas, has previously said Gamboa was walking with the rifle unloaded pointed at the ground before he was shot. Skordas has said he does not believe that Gamboa heard anyone tell him to drop the weapon.",
      "Alder told investigators that he fired at Gamboa after Gamboa began moving toward the crowd and did not respond when he yelled at the man to stop, according to Alder's charging document. He told detectives that Gamboa's behavior \"scared the hell out of me,\" the document said.",
      "The \"No Kings\" protests were nationwide demonstrations in the U.S. earlier this year that opposed the administration of President Donald Trump, citing perceived authoritarian and anti-democratic actions.",

    "story": [
      "Trump accounts are a new type of tax-deferred investment vehicle for U.S. children, created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill, which promises $1,000 seed contributions from the federal government for eligible kids.",

      "Michael Dell on why he's giving $6 billion to America's kids",
      "Stock investing for babies",
      "Who is eligible for a Trump account?",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens and who are born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, are eligible to have a Trump Account, according to a fact sheet from the Department of the Treasury. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for a one-time $1,000 contribution from the U.S. government.",
      "Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, but they won't receive the $1,000 gift from the government. However, parents, friends, employers and other parties can contribute tax-free dollars to an account.",
      "How do I open a Trump account?",
      "Parents or guardians must set up and manage the account until a child turns 18.",
      "The Treasury Department said households should use IRS Form 4547 to open a Trump account on behalf of a child. The newly created form is also where applicants can request the $1,000 U.S. government contribution to the account. The White House said that each Trump account for eligible children will launch with a $1,000 contribution from the government.",
      "In May 2026, the Treasury Department will send instructions to individuals who applied for government-funded accounts on how to activate them.",
      "When can I set up an account?",
      "Families can open a Trump account beginning in early 2026 and can start making financial contributions on July 4, 2026, according to the Trump Administration.",
      "How much can I contribute?",
      "Excluding the government's $1,000 donation, a total of $5,000 per child can be deposited into an account each year. Employers can contribute up to $2,500 per year to an employee's account tax-free, which will count toward the $5,000 limit.",
      "Financial contributions from cities, states, tribal governments and tax-exempt organizations, including nonprofit organizations, are generally not counted toward the $5,000 limit, according to employment law firm\u00a0Littler.",
      "Annual contribution limits to the accounts are indexed to inflation and will be adjusted after 2027, according to a notice from the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Can funds be withdrawn before a child turns 18?",
      "No. Families may not withdraw funds from a Trump account before a child turns 18, except for the following reasons:",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage\u00a0Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17\u00a0Distribution when the individual dies",
      "A rollover of the entire account to a Trump account with another brokerage",
      "Certain rollovers to an \"Achieving a Better Life Experience\"\u00a0account in the year the child turns 17",
      "Distribution when the individual dies",
      "After age 18, standard IRA rules for withdrawals apply.",
      "How will money in a Trump account be invested?",
      "Under the \"big, beautiful bill,\" funds in a Trump account must be invested in an authorized investment, such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Should I personally invest in the account?",
      "Financial experts advise people considering opening a Trump account to accept the government's $1,000 contribution \u2014 money is money, after all \u2014 but to think twice about putting in their own money. The reason: Other types of savings plans \u2014 such as a\u00a0529 plan, a tax-advantaged savings account for education expenses, or a custodial brokerage account, an investment account for a minor managed by an adult \u2014 can be more financially advantageous.",
      "\"The gift is the biggest part of this. It really is free money,\" Madeline Brown, a wealth and financial policy expert at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News.",
      "\"It's a nice perk for parents with children who qualified,\" added Kate Ashford, a wealth management specialist at personal finance company NerdWallet. \"But it's not a slam dunk, and it's not going to do as much for you as other accounts.\"",
      "She cited the accounts' contribution caps and more limited investment tax advantages as drawbacks compared to 529s or custodial brokerage accounts.",
      "\"The only advantage is your earnings grow tax-free over the years, but you pay the ordinary income tax rate \u2014 not, say, a capital gains tax rate,\" Ashford said.",
      "Adam Michel, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research firm, thinks there are better ways to set money aside for children, such as in a 529 or standard IRA account.",
      "\"Generally speaking, parents should not put their own money into a Trump account,\" he told CBS News. \"The primary use case for the accounts is to receive free money from sources like the government or private donations.\"",
      "For example, Michael and Susan Dell on Tuesday said they would donate a total of $6.25 billion \u2014 or $250 apiece \u2014 to millions of kids in Trump accounts.",
      "How do Trump accounts compare to a 529 savings plan?",
      "The government's initial starter deposit is an appealing feature of Trump accounts, according to experts. Beyond the seed money, however, they offer fewer benefits than other savings plans, according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "\"A simpler approach would consolidate today's patchwork of savings accounts into universal savings accounts that are flexible, tax-neutral and easier for families to use,\" the policy research group added in a report.",
      "To save money for college, a 529 plan, which lets families sock away money for education expenses tax-free, could be a better alternative, investment experts said. Savings from such an account can also be transferred to an IRA, offering account holders more flexibility to save for retirement or other expenses.",
      "The Trump accounts have \"many more strings attached and complicated rules that make it not an attractive overall investment vehicle,\" Michel of the Cato Institute said.",
      "To be sure, 529 plans also have limitations. If people use funds for non-education expenses, for example, they must pay a 10% penalty.",
      "Meanwhile, a Trump account offers some flexibility. Beneficiaries, once they are adults, may use the money for purposes beyond education, such as buying a home or starting a business, while the accounts also can serve as a kind of IRA.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said Wednesday that the committee has received financial records related to Jeffrey Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, while releasing what they said were \"never-before-seen\" photos and videos of Epstein's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "The financial documents could offer a window into Epstein's extensive business dealings and connections. Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018. He died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "Both banks reached legal settlements in 2023 over their involvement with Epstein. Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit from his accusers claiming the bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking. JPMorgan settled its own suit for $290 million, CBS News reported at the time. Both banks have said they regret their association with Epstein.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking member on the Oversight Committee, said Democrats plan to make the financial records public \"in the days ahead.\"",
      "New photos and videos of Epstein's island",
      "The committee also released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island, known as Little St. James, that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "\"These new images are a disturbing look into the world of Jeffrey Epstein and his island,\" Garcia said in a statement. \"We are releasing these photos and videos to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein's horrific crimes. We won't stop fighting until we deliver justice for the survivors. It's time for President Trump to release all the files, now.\"",
      "Some of the images and footage, including unredacted versions of several photos, were previously published by O'Keefe Media Group, a conservative outlet.",
      "The photos released by the committee show what appear to be various rooms in the estate, including bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens. One photo shows partially redacted handwriting on a blackboard in an office. Another shows what appears to be a medical office with masks of men's faces hanging from the walls. Others show various views from outside the buildings:",
      "One of the photos shows a dentist's chair, which a source tell CBS News was put in for one of Epstein's girlfriend, a European woman who was studying to be a dentist.",
      "The Oversight Committee sent a request to the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general on Nov. 18 for all documents, communications and other information about investigations or potential criminal investigations related to Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell, according to Garcia. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for \"conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors,\" as the Justice Department put it in 2022 when she was sentenced.",
      "Separate from the records the Oversight Committee has released, Congress passed and President Trump signed a law giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. That 30-day countdown began after the law was signed on Nov. 19. It's not yet clear how much information will be redacted.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-new-fuel-economy-standards-mpg-biden/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 09:44:55 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration proposed rules that would weaken fuel economy standards for vehicles set under President Biden in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is proposing new fuel economy standards for vehicles that would roll back efficiency rules implemented under former President Biden.",
      "Under the Transportation Department proposal, which was unveiled at a White House event on Wednesday, automakers would need to meet less stringent vehicle mileage requirements.",
      "Federal fuel economy rules are overseen by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under what's known as the\u00a0CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) Standards. Enacted by Congress in 1975, the regulations stipulate how many miles vehicles must be able to drive on a gallon of fuel, with specific standards for light-duty vehicles, as well as medium- and heavy-duty trucks.",
      "The rules aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help consumers save money on gas, according to the Transportation Department. Critics of the fuel standards have long argued they are costly for automakers, which must make technological improvements to reduce fuel usage, raising vehicle prices.",
      "The revamped fuel standards would reverse a Biden policy that \"forced automakers to build cars using expensive technologies that drove up costs, drove up prices and made the car much worse,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "Rules would sharply lower mileage standard",
      "If finalized, the plan would relax fuel economy standards by setting the industry average for light-duty vehicles at roughly 34.5 miles per gallon through the 2031 model year, lower than the 50 miles per gallon outlined by a Biden-era rule.",
      "On Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the previous rules drove up the cost of new cars and were \"completely unattainable\" for automakers. He initially\u00a0directed\u00a0NHTSA to review the CAFE regulations in January.",
      "The Transportation Department said the proposal is projected to save American families $1,000 on the average cost of a new vehicle and a total of $109 billion over the next five years.",
      "NHTSA Administrator Jonathan Morrison said the move to ease the mileage standards would make the nation's roads safer. \"Newer cars are safer cars and by reducing vehicle prices, more American families will be able to afford newer vehicles,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump was joined at Wednesday's event by senior auto industry executives.\u00a0In a statement shared with CBS News, Stellantis CEO Antonioa Filosa expressed support for the proposed fuel efficiency rules, saying the initiative would realign the CAFE standards \"with real-world market conditions as part of its wider vision for a growing U.S. automotive industry.\"",
      "General Motors also backed the proposed fuel economy standards, which would need to undergo an official rulemaking process before being adopted.",
      "\"GM supports the goals of NHTSA's proposed CAFE rule and its intention to better align fuel economy standards with market realities. We have long advocated for one national standard that upholds customer choice and provides the auto industry long-term stability,\" a spokesperson for the automaker said in a statement.",
      "The fuel economy proposal would roll back\u00a0a rule\u00a0finalized in June 2024 under the Biden administration aimed at raising the minimum gas mileage for passenger cars and light trucks by model year 2031.",
      "At the time, NHTSA said the new regulations would save Americans $23 billion at the gas pump and reduce pollution. Burning gas for vehicles is a major contributor to carbon emissions, which scientists have linked to climate change.",
      "The rules were also intended to spur automakers to produce more electric vehicles, a key Biden administration priority for the nation's transportation sector.",
      "Would new MPG rules ease car prices?",
      "CarEdge CEO Zach Shefska described the Trump administration proposal as a win for automakers, but said consumers shouldn't expect to see lower car prices right away. That's because automakers work at least five years ahead in their product development, he said, meaning it would take a while before any redesigned cars make it onto the road.",
      "If the proposal eventually does help lower vehicle prices, he said, \"It will happen years from now, not in the coming weeks or months.\"",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit organization that works to protect endangered species, said the Transportation Department proposal will increase the country's oil consumption and undermine the competitiveness of U.S. automakers.",
      "\"Trump's action will feed America's destructive use of oil, while hamstringing us in the green tech race against Chinese and other foreign carmakers,\" said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Wednesday's move is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged automakers to build cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The administration scrapped EV\u00a0tax credits\u00a0in September and has also proposed rules to eliminate\u00a0gas emission regulations.",

    "story": [
      "An instructor at the University of Oklahoma has been placed on leave after a student complained that she received a failing grade on a paper that cited the Bible to assert that the \"belief in multiple genders\" was \"demonic.\"",
      "Samantha Fulnecky, 20, filed a complaint with the administration, the latest flashpoint in the ongoing debate over academic freedom on college campuses amid President Trump's push to end diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and restrict how campuses discuss issues of race, gender and sexuality.",
      "\"OU remains firmly committed to fairness, respect and protecting every student's right to express sincerely held religious beliefs,\" the university wrote in an email on Wednesday.",
      "The school added that the failing grade \u2014 which was supposed to account for 3% of Fulnecky's final grade \u2014 would not affect the junior's academic standing. An investigation into Fulnecky's discrimination complaint is still ongoing.",
      "The assignment was for a psychology class about lifespan development. Students were asked to write a 650-word response to an academic study that examined whether conformity with gender norms was associated with popularity or bullying among middle school students.",
      "Fulnecky wrote that she was frustrated by the premise of the article because she doesn't believe that there are more than two genders based on her understanding of the Bible, according to a copy of her essay obtained by CBS affiliate KWTV.",
      "\"Society pushing the lie that there are multiple genders and everyone should be whatever they want to be is demonic and severely harms American youth,\" she wrote.",
      "She argued that promoting the belief in multiple genders would lead society to move \"farther from God's original plan for humans.\"",
      "In an interview with KWTV, Fulnecky said she believes that she deserved a perfect score.",
      "\"We have been getting these papers all semester, and I've written them all the same,\" she said. \"And I've gotten a 100 on all of them up until this point.\"",
      "Some have criticized her for not actually citing the Bible, but instead making a general reference, KWTV reported.",
      "\"I didn't specifically cite one verse of the Bible or one portion of the Bible,\" she told the station. \"But the instructions asked us to pull from our personal experiences and give thoughtful reaction based off of prior experiences and knowledge.\"",
      "The essays were graded out of 25 points, broken down by whether the student demonstrated an understanding of the article and addressed a specific aspect of the argument put forth. Fulnecky received zero points for her work.",
      "In a response to the essay, the instructor said Fulnecky's assignment \"does not answer the questions for the assignment, contradicts itself, heavily uses personal ideology over empirical evidence in a scientific class, and is at times offensive,\" KWTV reported.",
      "A second teacher in the class also told Fulnecky that she agreed with the other instructor's grade for the assignment, the station reported.",
      "Fulnecky's complaint to the administration went viral after the school's chapter of Turning Point USA, a conservative group founded by Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated in September, posted about Fulnecky's experience on the social media site X.",
      "\"Professors like this are the very reason conservatives can't voice their beliefs in the classroom,\" the group posted.",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt appeared to affirm that perspective, posting on X that the situation was \"deeply concerning.\"",
      "\"I'm calling on the OU regents to review the results of the investigation & ensure other students aren't unfairly penalized for their beliefs,\"\u00a0he wrote.",
      "The firestorm comes after a professor at Texas A&M was fired earlier this year after a video where a student confronted the instructor over her teaching of issues related to gender identity in a class on children's literature went viral. A university committee in late November ruled that the firing was without good cause, and flouted formal procedure.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, student affinity groups have shuttered campus offices and professors have altered curriculums. The president has also threatened federal funding for schools who don't comply with standards for teaching, admissions and gender in sports supported by the administration. Both supporters and opponents of the Trump administration's campaign say that freedom of speech is at stake.",

      "Visitors won't be able to stay overnight in the national park's oldest hotel or its lodges starting Saturday because of multiple breaks in the park's only water line. With no water being pumped to the South Rim, park officials say the limited resources need to be conserved.",
      "This marks only the second time the park has had to halt overnight stays because of water supply issues, although the pipeline has experienced frequent failures over the years as it has long exceeded its expected life span. In August 2024, park officials took unprecedented action and imposed water restrictions that forced the sudden shutdown of overnight hotel stays during one of the busiest times of the year.",
      "It's another major blow for the Grand Canyon's tourism industry, coming just a handful of months after a devastating wildfire destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the more isolated North Rim.",
      "Under the current restrictions, visitors can't stay at places that include El Tovar Hotel, Bright Angel Lodge and Maswik Lodge, and water is unavailable at campgrounds. For park staff and the 2,500 year-round residents of Grand Canyon Village, it means short showers, less toilet flushing and turning off faucets while shaving or brushing teeth.",
      "How long will the wait be? Park officials hope not long.",
      "\"If all planned work proceeds without additional issues, we anticipate being able to restore water service and begin reopening overnight lodging as early as next week,\" park spokesperson Jo\u00eblle Baird said in an email.",

      "In the meantime, day visitors are still welcome, and there is lodging available outside the park.",

      "The 12.5 mile-long\u00a0Transcanyon Waterline is the primary water source for park residents, staff and tourists. Originally built in the late 1960s, it has been a maintenance priority for years, and a portion of park entrance fees is set aside to help with costs.",
      "A $208 million rehabilitation of the pipeline and upgrades to the associated water delivery system started in 2023, with the National Park Service calling it a crucial investment to ensure the park can meet the needs of residents and visitors.

      "The United States government on Wednesday increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano, an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Through an organized crime rewards program operated by the Department of State, officials are now offering up to $5 million for tips that could bring Serrano into custody and potentially convict him on myriad drug charges.",
      "Mosquera Serrano was the first alleged member of Tren de Aragua to be added to the FBI's \"most wanted\" list, according to the State Department. He was initially indicted in Texas district court in January and charged with international cocaine trafficking conspiracy, then recharged in a second indictment in April that additionally accused him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, when he retook office in January. His administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the strikes are legal, and the first in that string of attacks, a deadly strike in early September, has prompted new concerns from Congress\u00a0that a follow-on strike despite there apparently being survivors in the water may constitute a war crime.",

Originally formed inside Venezuela's Tocor\u00f3n prison, Tren de Aragua expanded during the incarceration of Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the alleged head of the gang known as Ni\u00f1o Guerrero. U.S. authorities have said Guerrero came to control the prison in addition to a series of gold mines and border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, before eventually escaping custody.",
      "Mosquera Serrano is among the alleged members of Tren de Aragua who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which sanctioned 11 more alleged affiliates of the gang on Wednesday, according to the State Department.",
      "One of the latest rounds of sanctions also targeted Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, a Venezuelan entertainer known as \"Rosita,\" the U.S. Treasury announced, claiming she is a Tren de Aragua affiliate. Rosita is allegedly part of a group of five people in the entertainment industry who are accused of providing \"material support\" to the gang, according to the Treasury. She has also been accused of helping Guerrero escape from prison in 2012, while the group of five allegedly helped launder money for some of the gang's leaders, the department said.",
      "\"Under President Trump, barbaric terrorist cartels can no longer operate with impunity across our borders,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release. \"At the direction of President Trump, we will continue to use every tool to cut off these terrorists from the U.S. and global financial system and keep American citizens safe.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hepatitis-b-vaccine-what-parents-need-to-know/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Dec 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The three-dose hepatitis B vaccine has a long track record of safety, but rolling back recommendations could leave kids vulnerable to infections, doctors say.",
    "story": [
      "Working out of a tribal-owned hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, liver specialist Brian McMahon has spent decades treating the long shadow of hepatitis B. Before a vaccine became available in the 1980s, he saw the virus claim young lives in western Alaskan communities with stunning speed.",
      "One of his patients was 17 years old when he first examined her for stomach pain. McMahon discovered she had developed liver cancer caused by hepatitis B, just weeks before she was set to graduate from high school as valedictorian. She died before the ceremony.",
      "McMahon thinks often of an 8-year-old boy who showed no signs of illness until he complained of pain from what turned out to be a rapidly growing tumor on his liver.",
      "McMahon can still hear his voice.",
      "\"He was moaning in pain, saying, 'I know I am going to die soon,'\" he recalled. \"We were all crying.\" The boy died at home a week later.",
      "The hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids, even in microscopic amounts, and the virus can survive on surfaces for a week. Like many of his patients, McMahon said, both children contracted hepatitis B at birth or in early childhood.",
      "That outcome is now preventable. A birth dose of the vaccine, recommended for newborns since 1991, is up to 90% effective in preventing infection from the mother if given in the first 24 hours of life. If babies receive all three doses, 98% of them have immunity from the incurable virus, with the protection lasting at least 30 years.",
      "In the communities of western Alaska, years of targeted testing and widespread vaccination efforts led to the number of cases plummeting.",
      "\"Liver cancer has disappeared in children,\" McMahon said. \"We haven't seen a case since 1995. Nor do we have any children under 30 that have gotten infected that we know of.\"",
      "He worries those hard-won gains could soon be rolled back.",
      "Pushing back the dose?",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention vaccine advisory panel appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is scheduled to discuss and vote on the hepatitis B birth dose recommendation during its two-day meeting starting Dec. 4, potentially limiting children's access.",
      "On Tucker Carlson's podcast in June, Kennedy falsely claimed that the hepatitis B birth dose is a \"likely culprit\" of autism.",
      "He also said the hepatitis B virus is not \"casually contagious.\" But decades of research shows the virus can be transmitted through indirect contact, when traces of infected fluids like blood enter the body when people share personal items like razors or toothbrushes.",
      "The committee's recommendations carry weight. Most private insurers must cover the vaccines the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices endorses, and many state vaccination policies are directly linked to its guidelines.",
      "Neither ACIP nor the CDC is regulatory. They cannot mandate immunizations. It's up to states to do that. But keeping the recommendation for a hepatitis B vaccine at birth preserves the widest range of options for families. They can choose to vaccinate at birth, wait until later in childhood, or not vaccinate at all, and insurance will continue to cover the cost of the shot as long as it remains approved by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Two senior FDA officials \u2014 Commissioner Marty Makary and top vaccine regulator Vinay Prasad \u2014 suggested at the end of November that changes to the vaccine approval process may be coming. Vaccines must be approved by the FDA to be administered in the United States.",
      "In internal agency emails obtained by PBS NewsHour and The Washington Post, Prasad questioned the routine practice of \"giving multiple vaccines at the same time.\" It's not clear whether he was referring to combination vaccines that offer immunity against multiple diseases with a single shot. Three of the nine hepatitis B vaccines currently approved by the FDA are combination vaccines. The birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given only as a stand-alone vaccine.",
      "\"Sowing distrust\"",
      "If private insurers opt to still cover the shot, misinformation from the meeting still could lead families to falsely believe the vaccine could harm their babies, said Sean O'Leary, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.",
      "\"Whatever comes out of this disaster of a meeting in December is going to be mainly designed around sowing distrust and spreading fear,\" he said.",
      "President Donald Trump, Kennedy, and some newly appointed ACIP members have mischaracterized how the liver disease spreads, ignoring or downplaying the risk of transmission through indirect contact. The hepatitis B virus is far more infectious than HIV. Unvaccinated people, including children, can get infected from microscopic amounts of blood on a tabletop or toy, even when the infected person is asymptomatic.",
      "McMahon has cared for children who tested negative at birth and later became infected through indirect contact. In a study in the 1970s, nearly a third of such children went on to develop chronic hepatitis B without ever showing symptoms, he said.",
      "\"It's a very infectious virus,\" McMahon said. \"That's why giving everybody the birth dose is the best way to prevent it.\"",
      "The CDC recommends that all pregnant people be screened for hepatitis B, but it estimates that up to 16% are not tested and fall through the cracks. O'Leary and other experts say testing mothers for the virus shortly before or after delivery is unfeasible, because most hospitals lack the staff and resources.",
      "The three-dose vaccine has a long track record of safety. Numerous studies show it is not associated with an increased risk of infant death, fever or sepsis, multiple sclerosis, or autoimmune conditions, and severe reactions are rare.",
      "\"We have an incredible safety profile,\" O'Leary said. \"No one expects to get in a car wreck, right? And yet we all put our seat belts on. This is similar.\"",
      "The CDC estimates that 2.4 million people in the U.S. have hepatitis B and that half do not know they are infected. The disease can range from an acute infection to a chronic one, often with few to no symptoms. If the disease is left untreated, it can lead to serious conditions such as cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. There is no cure.",
      "Expert's advice to parents: Talk to a doctor",
      "William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP, said some parents struggle to understand why a healthy newborn needs a vaccine so soon after birth, especially for a virus they feel certain they don't have and often wrongly associate only with risky behaviors. Those perceptions, he said, mix with declining trust in public health and rising skepticism about vaccines.",
      "His advice to expectant parents who are on the fence is to talk to their doctor about the shots. Even if the pregnant woman has tested negative, he said, it's still important to give the baby the birth dose, because false negatives are possible and because the virus can spread so easily from surface contact. Babies who receive the full vaccine series starting from birth have their chance of liver cancer reduced by 84%.",
      "\"If you wait a month and if the mom happens to be positive, or the baby picks it up from a caregiver, by that time the infection is established in that baby's liver,\" Schaffner said. \"It's too late to prevent that infection.\"",
      "He said that if fewer people get vaccinated, hepatitis B will circulate at higher rates in American communities and the risk of contracting the virus will rise for everyone who doesn't get the shots.",
      "And more hepatitis B cases could mean higher costs for patients and the broader health care system. The CDC estimates treating someone with a less severe form of the disease costs $25,000 to $94,000 per year. For patients who require a liver transplant, annual medical expenses can climb above $320,000, depending on their treatment.",
      "Over the past 30 years, the main adverse events parents have reported from their babies receiving the birth dose have been fussiness and crying, both of which pass quickly. Schaffner said that's a very strong safety profile \u2014 for a newborn vaccine with a track record of protecting babies from an incurable disease.",
      "\"The data are so clear about this,\" Schaffner said. \"A whole array now of other countries have initiated this program. They've modeled it on us.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 19:25:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Details about the strikes on an alleged drug boat on Sept. 2 have alarmed legal experts and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Scrutiny over the Trump administration's strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats has intensified following the revelation that the first U.S. attack on such a vessel involved more than one strike, including one that killed survivors of the initial attack.",
      "Members of Congress \u2014 mostly Democrats \u2014 were already raising questions about the legality of the strikes and warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate into war with Venezuela. The new details about the strike on Sept. 2 have now led some lawmakers to openly question whether the attack on the survivors was a war crime.",
      "Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, the commander who oversaw the Sept. 2 operation,\u00a0briefed small groups of lawmakers on the strikes on Thursday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters after the classified briefings that Bradley said he had not been ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \"kill everybody,\" as was\u00a0reported\u00a0last week by the Washington Post.",
      "But Himes added that the lawmakers were shown video of the second strike, and said that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\" Cotton defended the attack, saying he \"saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight.\"",
      "As lawmakers continue to pursue the facts of what occurred on Sept. 2, doubts about the legality of the ongoing campaign against the alleged drug boats persist, with experts and former officials saying the strikes were shaky ground even before the latest revelations.",
      "The boat strikes",
      "Since the first strike on Sept. 2, the U.S. has carried out another 20 attacks through Nov. 15, killing more than 80 people the Trump administration alleges have been trafficking drugs in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
      "In a notification to Congress in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "\"We have legal authority. We're allowed to do that,\" President Trump told reporters on Oct. 22. \"They killed 300,000 people last year. Drugs, these drugs coming in. They killed 300,000 Americans last year, and that gives you legal authority.\"",
      "Analysis from The Free Press:\u00a0Killing Narco Speedboat Survivors is a War Crime",
      "But the opinion from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel justifying the strikes remains classified. A group of Senate Democrats asked for an \"expeditious declassification\" of the legal opinion in\u00a0a letter\u00a0last week to Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"Few decisions are more consequential for a democracy than the use of lethal force,\" they wrote. \"We therefore believe that the declassification and public release of this important document would enhance transparency in the use of deadly force by our nation's military and is necessary to ensure Congress and the American people are fully informed of the legal justification supporting these strikes.\"",
      "Consent from Congress",
      "Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats was already legally dubious before the recent revelations because the president lacked the authority to carry them out.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization.",
      "In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days, absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired a month ago.",
      "The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "When asked in early November whether the administration planned to seek congressional authorization, a senior administration official replied that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\"",
      "The official suggested that the attacks pose no threat to service members, since the strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel.\" The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force against Venezuela. Republicans have largely asserted that the president is acting under his Article II constitutional authority, and Senate Republicans have twice blocked bipartisan efforts aimed at preventing Mr. Trump from continuing military action in the region without congressional approval.",
      "But the new details about the Sept. 2 strike appear to have shifted some opinions. The Republican-led Senate and House Armed Services Committees have opened bipartisan investigations into the circumstances of the first attack.",
      "\"Nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization,\" says former military prosecutor",
      "The Trump administration's claim of a \"non-international armed conflict\" is also flawed, experts say, because drug cartels are not considered organized armed groups under the law of armed conflict.",
      "\"There is no international armed conflict because, inter alia, there are neither hostilities between States nor the requisite degree of State control over alleged drug cartels operating the boats. And there is no non-international armed conflict, both because the cartels concerned do not qualify as organized armed groups in the [law of armed conflict] sense, and because there were no hostilities between the United States and the cartels on Sept. 2, let alone hostilities that would reach the requisite level of intensity to cross the armed conflict threshold,\" legal experts Michael Schmitt, Ryan Goodman and Tess Bridgeman wrote in a Dec. 1 piece published by Just Security.",
      "Designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations also does not give the administration authority to use military force in the way that it has, said Brian Finucane, a senior adviser with the International Crisis Group and a former State Department lawyer.",
      "\"They don't have military hierarchies, don't have the capability to engage in combat operations, and so it's absurd to claim that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict with them,\" Finucane said.",
      "Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor and law professor at New England Law Boston, said drug cartels would still be subject to civilian law even with the terrorist group designation.",
      "\"There's nothing magic about calling something a terrorist organization that then gives the president the authority to respond militarily,\" Hansen said.",
      "Trump \"wants it both ways,\" expert says",
      "The Trump administration's characterization of the strikes as an \"armed conflict\" imposes additional duties and responsibilities on how the strikes are carried out, according to Hansen.",
      "If the strikes have not already crossed a legal line, it's possible the intentional killing of survivors may have.",
      "The Geneva Conventions, which are the core of the law of armed conflict, prohibit targeting civilians or members of the armed forces who are defenseless. The international treaties, which were adopted in 1949, also require the wounded to be \"collected and cared for.\"",
      "The Defense Department's Law of War Manual says, \"it is also prohibited to conduct hostilities on the basis that there shall be no survivors, or to threaten the adversary with the denial of quarter.\" The rule applies \"during non-international armed conflict.\"",
      "\"The president, he wants it both ways. He wants to call it an armed conflict, but then he doesn't even want to follow the rules of the armed conflict,\" Hansen said.",
      "The Post reported that a change in protocol was implemented after the Sept. 2 strike to emphasize rescuing any survivors, a detail that CBS News has not confirmed. Two men who survived a strike in the Caribbean on Oct. 16 were rescued by the U.S. Navy and repatriated to their countries of origin \u2014 Ecuador and Colombia. The strikes on Oct. 27 in the Pacific left one survivor, and Mexico led the search effort, but it suspended its search after four days, according to media reports.",
      "After Thursday's briefing, however, Cotton said there had been no change in how the military is treating survivors.",
      "\"There has been no change in the guidance or the order that the secretary has given to our troops,\" the Arkansas Republican said. \"In subsequent strikes, there is an example where survivors actually were shipwrecked and distressed and not trying to continue on their mission, and they were treated as they should be, as noncombatants.\"",
      "The second strike and what laws may have been broken",
      "There's growing debate about whether the follow-up strike that killed two survivors is a war crime.",
      "Congressional Democrats have said that if the reporting is accurate, the action does constitute a war crime. Republican Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that it would be \"an illegal act\" that is \"completely outside of anything that has been discussed with Congress.\"",
      "\"I think there's a broad consensus that it's illegal to kill people who are clinging to wreckage,\" GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Lawmakers and military experts say that the next question is what laws may have been broken, and that largely depends on the laws governing the strikes.",
      "\"If we're not in an armed conflict to begin with, then the whole paradigm, the legal paradigm of the laws that govern an armed conflict, don't apply,\" Hansen said. \"So what does apply? Well, domestic law. Then, it's murder under domestic law because you can't kill somebody \u2014 even if you think they're a criminal \u2014 without adjudication.\"",
      "\"Arguably, no order to kill them is legal,\" Hansen added. \"Because under domestic law, we don't kill people without bringing them to trial and giving them due process.\"",
      "Finucane also believes the strikes would fall under domestic military law.",
      "\"Murder on the high seas is implicated, conspiracy to commit murder outside of the United States, then murder is also an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\" he said.",
      "If the operation is an armed conflict, as the Trump administration suggests, the actions could constitute a war crime.",
      "\"Orders to 'kill everybody,' which can reasonably be regarded as an order to give 'no quarter,' and to 'double-tap' a target in order to kill survivors, are clearly illegal under international law,\" a group of former military lawyers outlined in an assessment Saturday. \"In short, they are war crimes.\"",
      "Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called the second strike a war crime in an interview with CBS News\u00a0on Monday.",
      "\"The basic rules of war that are involved here make very clear that you do not strike wounded people in the water in order to kill them. You basically then are responsible to try to make sure you do everything to try to protect their lives at that point. And that is the concern right now, whether or not this really violated the rules of war and constituted a criminal act.\"",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",
      "On Thursday evening, U.S. Southern Command announced another strike had killed four in the Eastern Pacific.",

    "summary": "Officials confirmed they received numerous reports from the public about a seal spotted in Richmond on Sunday before the fugitive turned up at the pub.",
    "story": [
      "A seal walked into a bar. Or to use a technical term, it galumphed.",
      "The creature was apparently lost, curious and well below New Zealand 's legal drinking age. It lodged itself under the dishwasher and showed no interest in calling a cab.",
      "It was a wet, lazy Sunday evening when the baby fur seal waddled into the Sprig + Fern The Meadows craft beer bar in Richmond, at the top of New Zealand's South Island. Accustomed to seeing animals in the pet-friendly bar, co-owner Bella Evans assumed the visitor was a dog before she took a closer look.",
      "\"Everyone was in shock,\" Evans said. \"Oh my gosh. What do we do? What's going on?\"",
      "A patron grabbed a sweater and tried to usher the seal out of the back door. Evading its pursuers, the creature dashed into a restroom and then hid under the dishwasher, which was swiftly unplugged.",
      "Another customer fetched a dog crate from home, and Evans made a plan to lure the unruly visitor out of its hiding place using a pizza topping the pub was offering as a special.",
      "\"I just went to my fianc\u00e9, I said, grab the salmon! Grab the salmon!\"",
      "Evans told local media that they \"lured it out with salmon and a dog crate.\"\ufeff",
      "Then it was a brief wait for conservation rangers to arrive. It turned out they were already tracking the wandering seal.",
      "\"It was their fourth call for the day,\" Evans said. \"They had been driving around this new-build subdivision trying to find this baby seal.\"",
      "New Zealand's conservation agency confirmed it received \"numerous\" reports from the public about a seal spotted in Richmond on Sunday before the fugitive turned up at the pub. Bar staff \"did a great job keeping the seal safe\" until rangers arrived, said Department of Conservation spokesperson Helen Otley.",
      "The seal was released on nearby Rabbit Island, considered a safe location because of its dog-free status, Otley said. It's not unusual for curious young seals to show up in unexpected places at this time of year, she added, as they follow rivers and streams up to 9 miles inland.",
      "\"They can turn up in unusual places, like this pub, but this is normal exploratory behavior,\" Otley said.",
      "Successful conservation programs in New Zealand have resulted in growing seal and sea lion populations, bringing them into closer contact with humans than before. Scientists refer to an annual \"silly season\" for both species, a period of months during which they regularly appear in strange places \u2013 houses, golf courses or busy roads.",
      "Evans, who has owned the pub with her partner for just a few months, said the baby fur seal was the first unruly patron she's had to evict. But she said the animal, named Fern by staff, was welcome back.",
      "\"There's been the running joke that we've got the seal of approval,\" she said.",
      "Salmon will remain on the menu.",
      "Meanwhile, New Zealand's Department of Conservation is warning about sea lions hanging around public places. In a Facebook post this week, the department said \"sea lions are out and about turning up on beaches, roads, golf courses - basically anywhere they feel like hanging out this summer.\"",
      "Authorities noted that pregnant females are on the hunt for safe birthing spots, \"which means that they'll push further inland to get away from territorial aggressive males - soon enough the pups will be exploring too, popping up in the most random places.\"",
      "Authorities asked the public to keep their dogs close and slow down near coastal hotspots.",
      "\"They're one of the rarest sea lions in the world \u2014 every pup counts, and we want this growing mainland colony to thrive,\" the department said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pentagon-briefing-congress-venezuela-alleged-drug-boats/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Dec 2025 17:22:59 -0500",
    "summary": "\"What I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service,\" Democratic Rep. Jim Himes said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Military officials showed lawmakers video of a second strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat behind closed doors on Capitol Hill on Thursday, and testified that there was no order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to kill everyone on board, multiple lawmakers said.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Navy Adm. Frank \"Mitch\" Bradley, head of Special Operations Command, briefed the leaders of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees for both the House and the Senate. The classified briefings centered on the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, including the\u00a0Sept. 2 follow-on strike\u00a0that has become a flashpoint in Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has been under fire since the Washington Post reported that a second missile killed two survivors of the initial strike. Hegseth has said the decision to strike the boat again was made by Bradley, who was leading the mission. The survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat before it was hit a second time, a source familiar with the matter\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, spoke with reporters after the briefings. They both said Bradley told them that he had not been ordered to leave no survivors. The\u00a0initial Post report\u00a0quoted an anonymous source as saying that, before the first strike, Hegseth verbally ordered that everyone on the boat be taken out. \"The order was to kill everybody,\" the Post's story quoted the source as saying. Hegseth has denied the Post's account.",
      "The lawmakers also said they were shown the video of the second attack, which has not been made public. Himes, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters after the briefing that \"what I saw in that room was one of the most troubling things I've seen in my time in public service.\"",
      "\"You have two individuals in clear distress without any means of locomotion, with a destroyed vessel, who are killed by the United States,\" Himes said.",
      "\"Any American who sees the video that I saw will see the United States military attacking shipwrecked sailors \u2014 bad guys, bad guys \u2014 but attacking shipwrecked sailors,\" Himes added. \"Now there's a whole set of contextual items that the admiral explained \u2014 yes, they were carrying drugs. They were not in the position to continue their mission in any way. People will someday see this video, and they will see that that video shows, if you don't have the broader context, an attack on shipwrecked sailors.\"",
      "President Trump said Wednesday that he would support releasing the footage.",
      "Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, refuted Himes' characterization of the video after his briefing, saying he \"didn't see anything disturbing about it.\"",
      "Cotton said the four strikes on Sept. 2 were \"entirely lawful and needful, and they were exactly what we'd expect our military commanders to do.\"",
      "\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound for the United States back over so they could stay in the fight, and potentially, given all the context we've heard of other narco-terrorist boats in the area coming to their aid to recover the cargo and recover those narco-terrorists,\" Cotton said.",
      "Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, who serves as the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittee and was also briefed, told reporters, \"I think it'd be hard to watch this series of videos and not be troubled,\" and said he has \"more policy questions than ever\" about the mission.",
      "Coons said there were certain aspects of the briefing that he found more reassuring concerning process and intelligence, but \"more broadly, what we are asking the men and women of our armed forces, and particularly the special forces, to do, I think still lacks clear justification.\"",
      "\"The underlying judgment that frames this entire operation is that if there is a boat with narcotics and people who are affiliated with a narcotics trafficking organization, that that's a legitimate target,\" Coons said. \"I've still got questions about that.\"",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he was \"deeply disturbed by what I saw this morning,\" and called for the Pentagon to release the footage of the second strike.",
      "\"This briefing confirmed my worst fears about the nature of the Trump Administration's military activities, and demonstrates exactly why the Senate Armed Services Committee has repeatedly requested\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and been denied\u00a0\u2014\u00a0fundamental information, documents, and facts about this operation. This must and will be the only beginning of our investigation into this incident.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also called the video \"very disturbing\" and said all members of Congress should see it. But Warner declined to weigh in on the legality or morality of it.",
      "GOP Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement after the briefings that there is \"no doubt in my mind about the highly professional manner in which the Department of War conducted, and is conducting the operations our nation has called them to do to protect the homeland.\"",
      "\"I am deeply concerned by the public statements made by others that seek to ignore the realities of targeting terrorists to score political points,\" he added.",
      "The strike has sparked bipartisan concern from lawmakers and vows to investigate. Though the administration has argued the follow-on strike was legal and justified, members of Congress and experts have questioned its legality, with accusations from some Democrats that it would constitute a war crime if the second strike targeted survivors.",
      "The strike was the first of the administration's campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Southern Hemisphere, which has now grown to more than 20 strikes and killed more than 80 people. The attacks attracted scrutiny from lawmakers even before the Post's report, since the administration is conducting them without authorization from Congress. The administration has argued it has the legal authority to conduct the strikes because it has designated drug cartels as terrorist organizations and U.S. troops are not in harm's way.",
      "Nikole  Killion, \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He and \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The United Kingdom and Norway have signed a pact to create a naval alliance in the North Atlantic, aimed at protecting undersea cables and hunting Russian submarines.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom and Norway are forming an alliance to \"hunt Russian submarines\" and protect communication lines in the North Atlantic Ocean, as part of a new defense agreement between the two countries, the U.K. government announced on Thursday.",
      "The agreement will see the British and Norwegian navies work side-by-side. Central to the deal is a new joint fleet of anti-submarine warships \u2014 in response to a 30% increase in the presence of Russian ships in U.K. waters over the last two years, according to the U.K.'s announcement. The fleet includes eight British vessels and at least five Norwegian vessels.",
      "\"At this time of profound global instability, as more Russian ships are being detected in our waters, we must work with international partners to protect our national security,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement. \"This historic agreement with Norway strengthens our ability to protect our borders and the critical infrastructure our nations depend on.\"",
      "John Healey, the U.K.'s head of defense, said the pact, called the Lunna House Agreement, will allow the two countries to \"patrol the North Atlantic as one, train together in the Arctic, and develop the advanced equipment that will keep our citizens safe now and into the future.\"",
      "Healey and Tore Sandvik, the head of defense in Norway, signed the agreement in London on Thursday.",
      "The naval alliance will mainly patrol an important maritime region between Greenland, Iceland and the U.K., and monitor the area for Russian activity, the U.K. government said. In addition to surveillance, the fleet will be tasked with defending the U.K.'s underwater cables and pipelines, which are responsible for overseas communications as well as electricity and gas transports and are located in that portion of the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The agreement provides for closer integration between Norwegian and British forces, cooperation on frigates, and joint drone projects in the High North,\" said Norway's ministry of defense.",
      "With the agreement, British forces will also have a larger role in Norway's defense with heightened presence and more training of British Royal Marines in Norway.",
      "\"Both navies will operate as one \u2013 sharing maintenance facilities, technology and equipment to create truly interchangeable forces able to deploy rapidly wherever needed,\" the U.K.'s announcement said.",
      "The announcement came as air crews were tracking Russian vessels operating in U.K. waters, including the Russian intelligence ship Yantar, which was detected several weeks ago at the edge of U.K. maritime territory just north of Scotland, according to British officials.",
      "Starmer welcomed Norwegian leader Jonas St\u00f8re to the U.K. on Thursday, convening at an air force base in northern Scotland. Starmer said at the base that the U.K. must \"remain vigilant to the ever-present threat\" that Russia poses to the country, BBC News reported.",

    "story": [
      "In a disused warehouse at an undisclosed location in Ukraine, a military drone instructor who goes by the call sign \"DC\" showed CBS News a makeshift practice course that students must learn to fly the increasingly indispensable devices through before they join the country's defense against Russia.",
      "The trainees have to master the operation of the small but mighty First-Person-View (FPV) drones, which have become a signature weapon in the ongoing war sparked by Russia's February 2022 full-scale invasion.",
      "\"In the battlefield, all you have to do is travel the biggest distance possible and fly, with such bad signal that your eyes will bleed,\" DC said calmly as he flew a practice drone around the course at the Killhouse Academy.",
      "Both civilians and military personnel learn at the academy to pilot FPV drones, and to use them as lethal weapons, through both computer simulations and practical flight and target practice using real drones.",
      "Practice and patience are essential, said DC, who is one of the men in charge of training Ukraine's next generation of defenders.",
      "\"You have to be calm, you cannot see a target and, for example, rush to it like a bull. You have to be able to be thinking\u00a0 and watching and detecting your target,\" DC said, \"it's the hardest part of the job.\"",
      "Despite their small size, the drones represent a major development in modern warfare. Once equipped with an explosive charge, they can be quickly flown to distant targets by remote operators piloting via a live feed from a camera mounted on the weapons.",
      "\"To save lives, to save money and time, you have to become unmanned. Because if you use manpower, it will only get you so far,\" said DC.",
      "The widespread use of cheaper, expendable drones in the nearly four-year-long war in Ukraine has been watched closely by the U.S. military. On June 6, President Trump signed the \"Unleashing American Drone Dominance\" executive order, seeking to shore up domestic production of cheap, lethal drones.",
      "The Pentagon has recently announced its intention to purchase 200,000 drones with lethal capabilities by 2027, as part of what it calls the Drone Dominance Program.",
      "For both Ukrainian and Russian troops on the battlefield, drones are already very much a reality, accounting for about 80% of military casualties in Ukraine, according to some estimates. They have revolutionized warfare, and given Ukraine a way to try to level the playing field against Russia, which has vastly more soldiers to throw at the front lines.",
      "\"If you want to survive, you will find the best solution,\" DC told CBS News.",
      "He said he was unsure how many Russian soldiers he'd killed on the battlefield, but his focus now is on training others to compete with Russia's drone operators. He compared it to an arms race.",
      "\"Only those survive who adapt. Adaptability is key,\" he said. \"It's a constant race for us and for them, to find an upper hand over the enemy.\"",

    "summary": "A U.K. inquiry says Russian agents \"carry out Putin's bidding,\" blaming him for a deadly 2018 attack in England using the nerve agent Novichok.",
    "story": [
      "London - The British government announced new sanctions against Russia on Thursday and summoned the country's top diplomat in London, \"to answer for Russia's ongoing campaign of hostile activity against the U.K.\" after an inquiry found Russian President Vladimir Putin was responsible for a 2018 poison attack that killed an innocent woman in England.",
      "The new sanctions specifically target Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, which Britain has long accused of carrying out the attack targeting a former Russian double agent, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. Skripal and his daughter were seriously sickened in the poisoning, along with a British police officer, but the only person killed was the innocent bystander, Dawn Sturgess.",
      "\"GRU agents carry out Putin's bidding, seeking to destabilize Ukraine and attempting to sow chaos and disorder across Europe,\" the U.K. government said in a statement.",
      "An inquest was established to investigate Sturgess' death, who collapsed in Wiltshire, England after applying a substance she believed to be perfume, but which was really a bottle of Novichok left behind by the perpetrators of the attack.",
      "Soon after the inquest began its work, \"it became clear that her death could not properly be understood without also investigating the earlier nerve agent event in Salisbury,\" a nearby town where Skripal was targeted, said the inquest's final report, which was released on Thursday. \"There had been no other known instance of Novichok poisoning in the U.K., nor has there been any since.\"",
      "Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer whom Russian authorities accused of spying for Britain, had defected to the U.K. He was found a few months before Sturgess' death, slumped on a bench in Salisbury next to his unconscious daughter. Both, it was determined, had been poisoned by Novichok.",
      "The bottle that Sturgess found and believed to contain perfume was used in the attack on Skripal, likely applied to his front door handle, the inquiry concluded, and was brought to the U.K. from Russia by Russian GRU agents.",
      "GRU agents then \"recklessly discarded this bottle somewhere public or semi-public before leaving Salisbury on Sunday 4 March,\" the inquiry report said. \"They can have had no regard to the hazard thus created, of the death of, or serious injury to, an uncountable number of innocent people.\"",
      "The bottle was later found by Sturgess' boyfriend and given to her as a gift, the report said. She applied what she believed was her gifted perfume and later died.",
      "\"I have concluded that the operation to assassinate Sergei Skripal must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin,\" the inquiry's lead, former U.K. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Hughes, said in the report. \"I therefore conclude that all those involved in the assassination attempt \u2026 were morally responsible for Dawn Sturgess' death.\"",
      "In a statement announcing the new sanctions, the U.K. government said the GRU, \"attempts to conduct hybrid operations, including using cyber-attacks and spreading disinformation with intent to cause devastating real-world consequences, as well as recruiting criminal proxies to do their dirty work.\"",
      "\"The U.K. will always stand up to Putin's brutal regime and call out his murderous machine for what it is. Today's sanctions are the latest step in our unwavering defense of European security, as we continue to squeeze Russia's finances and strengthen Ukraine's position at the negotiating table,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in the statement.",
      "The U.K will continue to work closely with allies to \"counter Russia's attempts to destabilize our societies,\" the statement said.",

    "summary": "In all, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire began in early October.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli and Thai officials said Thursday that remains handed over to Israel by militants in Gaza had been identified as the last Thai hostage taken during the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that sparked the war.",
      "The Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was notified by Israeli authorities that the remains of a hostage returned on Wednesday were identified as Sudhisak Rinthalak, a Thai national who was an agricultural worker on a kibbutz.",
      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed in a statement that Rinthalak's remains were identified by Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine.",
      "Nikorndej Balankura, the Thai ministry's spokesperson, said Sudhisak's family had been notified. He added that Sudhisak was killed on the day of the Oct. 7 attack, and his body was taken into Gaza.",
      "He thanked the Israeli government for its assistance, which led to the release of all Thai hostages.",
      "In all, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others have been returned to Israel since a U.S.-brokered ceasefire began in early October. The returns are a key part of the terms of a shaky ceasefire, which has held despite both Hamas and Israel accusing each other of violations.",
      "With the return of Rinthalak's remains, the body of just one hostage is still believed to be in Gaza, that of Ran Gvili, bringing the two sides close to wrapping up the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Gvili served in an elite Israeli police unit. After helping people escape from the Nova music festival during the Oct. 7 attack, he was killed fighting at another location and his body was taken to Gaza. The military confirmed his death four months later. He is survived by his parents and a sister.",
      "\"The Government and the entire Directorate for the Hostages and the Missing of the State of Israel are determined, committed, and working tirelessly to return National Counter-Terrorism Unit fighter and hero Master Sgt. Ran Gvili for a proper Jewish burial,\" Netanyahu's office said Thursday.",

    "summary": "D-Day veteran Charles Shay was awarded the Silver Star for repeatedly plunging into the sea and carrying critically wounded soldiers to relative safety.",
    "story": [
      "Charles Shay, a decorated Native American veteran who was a 19-year-old U.S. Army medic when he landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day and helped save lives, died on Wednesday. He was 101.",
      "Shay died at his home in Bretteville-L'Orgueilleuse in France's Normandy region, his longtime friend and carer Marie-Pascale Legrand said.",
      "Shay, of the Penobscot tribe and from Indian Island in the U.S. state of Maine, was awarded the Silver Star for repeatedly plunging into the sea and carrying critically wounded soldiers to relative safety, saving them from drowning. He also received France's highest award, the Legion of Honor, in 2007.",
      "Shay had been living in France since 2018, not far from the shores of Normandy where nearly 160,000 troops from Britain, the U.S., Canada and other nations landed on D-Day on June 6, 1944. The Battle of Normandy hastened Germany's defeat, which came less than a year later.",
      "\"He passed away peacefully surrounded by his loved ones,\" Legrand told The Associated Press.",
      "Shay told CBS News in 2019 that he moved to France to be close to his fallen brothers.",
      "\"I will die here,\" Shay told CBS News at the time. \"I believe that I can talk with the souls of the men that are still wandering on the beach here. And I just tried to assure them that they are not forgotten.\"",
      "The Charles Shay Memorial group, which honors the memory of about 500 Native Americans who landed on the Normandy beaches, said in a statement posted on Facebook that \"our hearts are deeply saddened as we share that our beloved Charles Norman Shay \u2026 has returned home to the Creator and the Spirit World.\"",
      "\"He was an incredibly loving father, grandfather, father-in-law, and uncle, a hero to many, and an overall amazing human being,\" the statement said. \"Charles leaves a legacy of love, service, courage, spirit, duty and family that continues to shine brightly.\"",
      "Ready to give his life",
      "On D-Day, 4,414 Allied troops lost their lives \u2014 2,501 of them Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded. On the German side, several thousand were killed or wounded.",
      "\"Mortars and artillery coming at us,\" Shay told CBS News in 2019. \"When the ramp went down, the men that were standing in the front, some of them were killed immediately.\"",
      "Others were so badly hurt, they couldn't drag themselves out of the surf.",
      "\"Many men that had been wounded were laying and could not help themselves in the tide,\" Shay told CBS News.",
      "Shay survived.",
      "\"I guess I was prepared to give my life if I had to. Fortunately, I did not have to,\" Shay said in a 2024 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\"I had been given a job, and the way I looked at it, it was up to me to complete my job,\" he recalled. \"I did not have time to worry about my situation of being there and perhaps losing my life. There was no time for this.\"",
      "On that night, exhausted, he eventually fell asleep in a grove above the beach.",
      "\"When I woke up in the morning, it was like I was sleeping in a graveyard because there were dead Americans and Germans surrounding me,\" he recalled. \"I stayed there for not very long and I continued on my way.\"",
      "Shay then pursued his mission in Normandy for several weeks, rescuing those wounded, before heading with American troops to eastern France and Germany, where he was taken prisoner in March 1945 and liberated a few weeks later.",
      "Spreading a message of peace",
      "After World War II, Shay reenlisted in the military because the situation of Native Americans in his home state of Maine was too precarious due to poverty and discrimination.",
      "Maine would not allow individuals living on Native American reservations to vote until 1954.",
      "Shay continued to witness history \u2014 returning to combat as a medic during the Korean War, participating in U.S. nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands and later working at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria.",
      "For over 60 years, he did not talk about his WWII experience.",
      "But he began attending D-Day commemorations in 2007 and in recent years, he has seized many occasions to give his powerful testimony and spread a message of peace.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020-2021, Shay's lone presence marked commemoration ceremonies as travel restrictions prevented other veterans or families of fallen soldiers from the U.S., Britain and other allied countries from making the trip to France.",
      "Sadness at seeing war back in Europe",
      "For years, Shay used to perform a sage-burning ceremony, in homage to those who died, on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach, where the monument bearing his name now stands.",
      "On June 6, 2022, he handed over the remembrance task to another Native American, Julia Kelly, a Gulf War veteran from the Crow tribe. That was just over three months after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in what was to become the worst war on the continent since 1945.",
      "Shay then expressed his sadness at seeing war back on the continent.",
      "\"Ukraine is a very sad situation. I feel sorry for the people there and I don't know why this war had to come,\" he said. \"In 1944, I landed on these beaches and we thought we'd bring peace to the world. But it's not possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "A man alleged to be the founder and leader of a Haitian gang was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison for orchestrating the 2021 kidnapping of 17 people \u2014 16 of them Americans \u2014 including five children, who were on a missionary trip to the Caribbean country.",
      "Joly Germine declined to say anything before U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., sentenced him.",
      "\"No remorse has been shown by Mr. Germine. No acceptance of responsibility,\" the judge said.",
      "Some of the kidnapping victims chose to speak in court, telling Germine they forgive him for his role in their ordeal.",
      "Ray Noecker, whose wife, Cheryl, and five children were held hostage, said it was a \"life-changing experience\" for their family. He turned to Germine and told him that he hopes he finds \"God's peace.\"",
      "\"True freedom is not found outside of prison walls. True freedom is found inside your own heart,\" Noecker said.",
      "The victims \u2014 16 U.S. citizens and one Canadian citizen \u2014 were kidnapped by gang members near Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Oct. 16, 2021. Two hostages were\u00a0freed\u00a0in November 2021 and three more were\u00a0released\u00a0in early December. The remaining 12 escaped later in December after\u00a0being held at gunpoint for 62 days.",
      "Prosecutors also sought a life sentence. They said Germine, now 34, led the \"400 Mawozo\" gang from a prison in Haiti.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Germine ran the gang from behind bars using unmonitored cellphones, staying in constant contact with other 400 Mawozo leaders, most of them relatives. They say he controlled the gang's finances, supplied its weapons and directed its operations.",
      "\"This horrific crime was driven by defendant Germine's own self-interest; he wanted to secure his release from prison in exchange for the hostages,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Germine denies that he was a leader of the gang, according to his attorneys. They said he became involved in politics after allowing farmers to grow crops on his land.",
      "\"Mr. Germine genuinely tried to help his countrymen, especially those that did not have much. The Haitian government did not provide services and resources to the poor like we have in this country, and Mr. Germine tried to fill the gap,\" his lawyers wrote.",
      "The Christian missionaries were returning from a visit to an orphanage when kidnappers forced their bus to stop. One of the kidnapped children was 8 months old.",
      "The gang took credit for the kidnappings on social media and initially demanded a ransom of $17 million, or $1 million for each victim. But the hostage-takers later contacted a representative of the missionaries and asked for Germine's release from prison.",
      "Germine, also known as \"Yonyon,\" was the first person to be charged in connection with the kidnapping. He remained in prison but was transferred to the U.S. to face charges in a May 2022 indictment. After a trial earlier this year, a jury convicted him of charges including conspiracy to commit hostage taking.",
      "Germine was separately convicted of participating in a plot to smuggle semiautomatic firearms from the U.S. to Haiti for gang members' use. For that case, Bates sentenced him last year to 35 years in prison.",

    "summary": "The U.S. has increased its reward to $5 million for information leading to the arrest of an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "The United States government on Wednesday increased its reward for information leading to the arrest of Giovanni Vicente Mosquera Serrano, an alleged leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Through an organized crime rewards program operated by the Department of State, officials are now offering up to $5 million for tips that could bring Serrano into custody and potentially convict him on myriad drug charges.",
      "Mosquera Serrano was the first alleged member of Tren de Aragua to be added to the FBI's \"most wanted\" list, according to the State Department. He was initially indicted in Texas district court in January and charged with international cocaine trafficking conspiracy, then recharged in a second indictment in April that additionally accused him of supporting a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "President Trump labeled Tren de Aragua\u00a0a foreign terrorist organization, alongside other gangs and cartels, when he retook office in January. His administration has since ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela and its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. In recent months, the U.S. has amassed a large military presence in the Caribbean and carried out multiple\u00a0strikes on boats it claims are carrying drugs from Venezuela.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the strikes are legal, and the first in that string of attacks, a deadly strike in early September, has prompted new concerns from Congress\u00a0that a follow-on strike despite there apparently being survivors in the water may constitute a war crime.",
      "Tren de Aragua's members are accused of a lengthy record of violent crimes, including murder, human trafficking, rape, kidnapping, bribery and racketeering. Originally formed inside Venezuela's Tocor\u00f3n prison, Tren de Aragua expanded during the incarceration of Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, the alleged head of the gang known as Ni\u00f1o Guerrero. U.S. authorities have said Guerrero came to control the prison in addition to a series of gold mines and border crossings between Venezuela and Colombia, before eventually escaping custody.",
      "Mosquera Serrano is among the alleged members of Tren de Aragua who have been sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which sanctioned 11 more alleged affiliates of the gang on Wednesday, according to the State Department.",
      "One of the latest rounds of sanctions also targeted Jimena Romina Araya Navarro, a Venezuelan entertainer known as \"Rosita,\" the U.S. Treasury announced, claiming she is a Tren de Aragua affiliate. Rosita is allegedly part of a group of five people in the entertainment industry who are accused of providing \"material support\" to the gang, according to the Treasury. She has also been accused of helping Guerrero escape from prison in 2012, while the group of five allegedly helped launder money for some of the gang's leaders, the department said.",
      "\"Under President Trump, barbaric terrorist cartels can no longer operate with impunity across our borders,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release. \"At the direction of President Trump, we will continue to use every tool to cut off these terrorists from the U.S. and global financial system and keep American citizens safe.\"",

    "summary": "Ukrainian member of parliament Lisa Yasko told CBS News the Russian president is using the discussions with the U.S. to push his vision of the new world order.",
    "story": [
      "A Ukrainian lawmaker told CBS News on Wednesday that President Trump should not approach peacemaking efforts with Russia like a business deal, saying the American leader must \"understand he cannot trade with Putin\" as the \"aggressor\" in the war, which is nearing its four-year mark.",
      "Lisa Yasko, a member of Ukraine's parliament from the same party as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, spoke with CBS News after high-level talks in Moscow between Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff failed to yield any breakthroughs.",
      "Yasko said that was largely due to Putin's lukewarm interest in achieving peace.",
      "\"[Putin] was smiling so much at this meeting with Witkoff, but absolutely this is not about the peace itself,\" she said. \"He's interested in showing that he's geopolitically active ... how cool you are, how Americans are treating you and that you are not a war criminal.\"",
      "\"President Trump can be very transactional, in a good way also,\" Yasko told CBS News. \"But you cannot make peace with only economic deals. You cannot go that far as pleasing an aggressor. I believe there are certain lines.\"",
      "The Tuesday meeting in the Russian capital, which also included Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, was part of a concerted push by the White House to broker an agreement based on a Trump administration proposal.",
      "That proposal was initially floated by the White House weeks ago as a 28-point plan, but Ukraine and its European partners balked at calls for Kyiv to cede occupied territory to Russia, and the draft was later amended during talks with Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "After the five-hour round of talks on Tuesday, Yuri Ushakov, a senior adviser to Putin, told reporters the conversation was \"rather useful, constructive, rather substantive,\" but that \"we are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done.\"",
      "When asked by CBS News if she believed Putin was just playing for time by continuing to meet, Yasko said the Russian strongman's true intention was clear: to change the global order and assert Russia as a key powerbroker.",
      "\"Putin is trying to have his new world order by playing a central part in the [global] economy with China and the U.S. and with other parts of the world,\" Yasko said. \"Now Trump is offering a deal with benefits for [the] Russian economy. It's insanity for all of us here in Ukraine.\"",
      "Putin, speaking before the talks in Moscow on Tuesday, accused America's European allies of standing in the way of Mr. Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, saying he wasn't looking for a conflict with Europe, but adding that Russia was \"ready for war.\"",
      "Yasko urged Mr. Trump to come and see for himself the impact of Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion on Ukraine and its people \u2014 a trip Zelenskyy has also repeatedly urged his American counterpart to make.",
      "\"He should come here first,\" she told CBS News. \"He should see what happened in Ukraine. He should see the faces, the eyes of people.\"",
      "Yasko called the peace deal initially put forward by the Trump administration \"insulting\" to Ukraine.",
      "Many European leaders have voiced concern that if Russia is given what it wants in exchange for a ceasefire in Ukraine, it would set a dangerous precedent of appeasing a unilateral landgrab, and it could encourage Russia to increase threats against their countries.",
      "Already, America's Western European NATO allies have accused Russia of breaching their airspace with drone flights around airports and military bases, as well as fighter jets. There have also been allegations of a widespread Russian sabotage campaign targeting key infrastructure in Europe.",
      "European leaders, meanwhile, appear to have been largely sidelined as the White House negotiates directly with Russia and Ukraine.",

    "story": [
      "The family of a Colombian man who was killed in a U.S. military strike on a boat in the Caribbean has lodged a complaint against the United States with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR).",
      "The family of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina, who was killed on Sept. 15, rejected assertions there were any drugs on the vessel targeted in Washington's anti-narcotics military campaign, and insisted he was a fisherman just doing his job on the open sea.",
      "\"We know that Pete Hegseth, US Secretary of Defense, was responsible for ordering the bombing of boats like those of Alejandro Carranza Medina and the murder of all those on such boats,\" reads the complaint seen by AFP on Wednesday.",
      "U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific have killed more than 80 people on boats that Washington claims, without providing evidence, were ferrying drugs from Venezuela. Legal experts and lawmakers critical of the strikes have argued that the military action targeting the suspected drug smuggling boats are legally dubious.",
      "Family members and victims' governments insist some of those killed were fishermen, and rights groups say the strikes are illegal even if the targets were in fact drug traffickers.",
      "The IACHR complaint said Hegseth gave the orders \"despite the fact that he did not know the identity of those being targeted for these bombings and extra-judicial killings\" it said were \"ratified\" by President Trump.",
      "The IACHR is a quasi-judicial body of the Organization of American States, created to protect human rights in the region.",
      "In a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Hegseth said the U.S. has \"only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\" He noted a recent pause in strikes, explaining that \"it's hard to find boats to strike right now.\"",
      "\"Deterrence has to matter,\" he said. \"Not arrest and hand over and then do it again, the rinse-and-repeat approach of previous administrations.\"",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who has called the U.S. strikes \"extrajudicial executions,\" has vowed support for the family in its quest for justice.",
      "\"My lawyer Dan Kovalik has begun the legal defense of the Carranza family, victims of the American assassination of Alejandro Carranza, the fisherman from Santa Marta killed by a missile fired at his boat in the Caribbean and poor in solidarity,\" Petro wrote on social media on Monday.",
      "A \"good man,\" widow says",
      "In an interview with AFP in October, Carranza's widow Katerine Hernandez, said he had been a \"good man.\"",
      "He left behind four children.",
      "\"He had no ties to drug trafficking, and his daily activity was fishing,\" Hernandez said.",
      "\"Why did they just take his life like that?\" she asked during the interview. \"The fishermen have the right to live. Why didn't they just detain them?\"",
      "Before his last trip, Carranza told his father he was heading to a spot \"with good fish.\"",
      "Days passed without contact, until the family learned of the bombing on television.",
      "\"The days went by and he didn't call,\" Hernandez said.",
      "Friends interviewed by AFP also insisted Carranza was a fisherman.",
      "\"He went offshore to catch sierra, tuna, and snapper, which are found far out at this time of year,\" said Cesar Henriquez, who has known him since childhood.",
      "\"He always came back to Santa Marta, secured his boat, and went home. I never knew him to do anything bad,\" Henriquez told AFP.",

      "The death toll in Hong Kong's apartment complex fire climbed to 159 on Wednesday, as six people were arrested on suspicion of deactivating some fire alarms during maintenance work at the housing complex, authorities said.",
      "The youngest person who died in the fire was a 1-year-old baby, police said. The oldest was 97. At least 91 women and 41 men were among the dead, according to Commissioner of Police Joe Chow.",
      "Police said they have completed a search for bodies inside all seven of eight high-rise residential towers ravaged in the fire that first broke out last Wednesday and took until Friday to be extinguished. About 30 people were still reported missing.",
      "\"We have found 159 bodies, of whom 140 were identified on a preliminary basis,\" Chow told reporters at a news conference, describing the information as an \"interim wrap-up\" following the completion of building searches.",
      "Chow said officials would continue to search through piles of fallen bamboo scaffolding to check if remains or bodies were buried there, adding: \"We have not finished our work yet.\"",
      "He also said officers had found \"suspected human bones,\" which needed to undergo forensic testing, in the debris, so the death toll could still rise.",
      "The deadly blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, in the northern suburban district of Tai Po, which was undergoing a monthslong renovation project with buildings covered by bamboo scaffolding and green netting.",
      "Police and the city's anti-corruption body said Tuesday that they had arrested 15 people as authorities probe corruption and negligence in relation to the renovation work. Substandard plastic nylon netting covering scaffoldings erected outside the towers and foam boards installed on windows were found to have aided the fire's rapid spread, authorities said earlier this week.",
      "Chris Tang, Hong Kong's Secretary for Security, said police are investigating the Binzhou Inspection and Testing Center in China, which provided the safety inspection certificate for the construction netting.",
      "Meanwhile, the city will remove all external scaffolding nets from ongoing renovations, Tang said. The materials will need to be tested before they are allowed to be installed again.",
      "In addition to the scaffolding issue, residents and officials have said that some fire alarms in the buildings failed to sound when the fire broke out, though it was not clear how widespread that problem was within the complex.",
      "Police said Wednesday that six people who allegedly deactivated some fire alarms at the housing complex during the renovation works were arrested on suspicion of making false representation to the fire services department.",
      "The initial cause of the fire was still under investigation.",
      "Nineteen bodies among the 159 were still unidentified, police said. Ten migrants who worked as domestic helpers at the housing complex, including nine from Indonesia and one from the Philippines, as well as one firefighter, were among those killed in the fire.",

      "The authors of a study that examined climate change's potential effect on the global economy said Wednesday that data errors led them to slightly overstate an expected drop in income over the next 25 years.",
      "The researchers at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, writing in the journal Nature in 2024, had forecast a 19% drop in global income by 2050. Their revised analysis puts the figure at 17%.",
      "The authors also said in their original work that there was a 99% chance that, by midcentury, it would cost more to fix damage from climate change than it would cost to build resilience. Their new analysis, not yet peer-reviewed, lowered that figure to 91%.",
      "The Associated Press reported on the original study. Nature posted a retraction of it Wednesday.",
      "The researchers cited data inaccuracies in the first paper, particularly with underlying economic data for Uzbekistan between 1995 and 1999 that had a large influence on the results, and that their analysis had underestimated statistical uncertainty.",
      "Max Kotz, one of the study's authors, told the AP that the heart of the study is unchanged: Climate change will be enormously damaging to the world economy if unchecked, and that the impact will hit hardest in the lowest-income areas that contribute the fewest emissions driving the planet's warming.",

    "summary": "11 years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished without a trace, a U.S. firm is to resume its hunt for the Boeing 777 in the Indian Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\u00a0\u2014 Malaysia's government said Wednesday that American marine robotics company Ocean Infinity would soon resume the seabed search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, more than a decade after the plane vanished over the Indian Ocean.",
      "MH370, a Boeing 777, disappeared from air-traffic radar 39 minutes after departing from Kuala Lumpur enroute to Beijing, China, on March 8, 2014. The packed passenger jet's disappearance without a trace sparked one of aviation's most baffling mysteries.",
      "Despite years of multinational searches, investigators still do not know exactly what happened to the plane or its 239 passengers and crew.",
      "The Malaysian government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity would resume its search from Dec. 30, about eight months after the last effort was abandoned. Malaysia's transport minister announced in early April that a roughly six-week search by the U.S. firm was ending, saying it wasn't \"the season\" for the work at sea. The minister said at the time that efforts would resume around the end of the year.",
      "The government said Wednesday that Ocean Infinity would resume searching intermittently from Dec. 30 for a total of 55 days, in targeted areas believed to have the highest likelihood of finding the missing aircraft.",
      "Herculean search efforts in the southern Indian Ocean, where the jet is believed to have gone down, have thus far turned up virtually nothing. Apart from a few small fragments that washed ashore, no bodies or large wreckage have ever been recovered.",
      "Below is a look at what we know about the deadly aviation tragedy.",
      "\"Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\"",
      "The pilot's last radio call to Kuala Lumpur \u2014 a simple, \"Good night, Malaysian Three Seven Zero\" \u2014 was the final communication before the plane crossed into Vietnamese airspace. It never checked in with controllers there.",
      "Minutes later, the plane's transponder, which broadcasts its location, shut down. Military radar showed the jet turn back over the Andaman Sea, and satellite data suggested it continued flying for hours, possibly until fuel exhaustion, before crashing into a remote section of the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Theories about what happened range from hijacking to cabin depressurization or power failure. There was no distress call, ransom demand, evidence of technical failure or severe weather.",
      "Malaysian investigators in 2018 cleared the passengers and crew but did not rule out \"unlawful interference.\" Authorities have said someone deliberately severed communications and diverted the plane.",
      "Who was on MH370 when it vanished?",
      "MH370 carried 227 passengers, including five young children, and 12 crew members. Most passengers were Chinese, but there were also citizens from the United States, Indonesia, France, Russia and elsewhere.",
      "Among those aboard were two young Iranians traveling on stolen passports, a group of Chinese calligraphy artists, 20 employees of U.S. tech firm Freescale Semiconductor, a stunt double for actor Jet Li and several families with young children. Many families lost multiple members.",
      "Largest underwater search in history",
      "Search operations began in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, then expanded to the Andaman Sea and the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "Australia, Malaysia and China coordinated the largest underwater search in history, covering roughly 46,000 square miles of seabed off western Australia. Aircraft, vessels equipped with sonar and robotic submarines scoured the ocean for signs of the plane.",
      "Signals thought to be from the plane's black box turned out to be from other sources, and no wreckage was found. The first confirmed debris was a flaperon discovered on R\u00e9union Island in July 2015, with additional fragments later found along the east coast of Africa. The search was suspended in January 2017.",
      "In 2018, U.S. marine robotics company Ocean Infinity resumed the hunt under a \"no find, no fee\" agreement, focusing on areas identified through debris drift studies, but it ended without success.",
      "Challenging search conditions in the Indian Ocean",
      "One reason such an extensive search may have failed to turn up clues is that no one knows exactly where to look. The Indian Ocean is the world's third largest, and the search was conducted in a difficult area, where searchers encountered bad weather and average depths of around 2.5 miles.",
      "It's not common for planes to disappear in the deep sea, but when they do remains can be very hard to locate. Over the past 50 years, dozens of planes have vanished, according to the Aviation Safety Network.",
      "Malaysia's government gave the green light in March for another \"no-find, no-fee\" contract with Ocean Infinity to resume the seabed search operation across a newly identified 5,800-square-mile site in the ocean. Ocean Infinity will be paid $70 million for its work, but only if wreckage is discovered.",
      "It is unclear if the company has new evidence of the plane's location. It has said it would utilize new technology and has worked with many experts to analyze data and narrow the search area to the most likely site.",

    "summary": "India's government, amid an uproar over privacy, has revoked an order quietly issued to smartphone makers to pre-install a state-run security app.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's government revoked an order on Wednesday that had directed smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung to install a state-developed and owned security app on all new devices. The move came after two days of criticism from opposition politicians and privacy organizations that the \"Sanchar Saathi\" app was an effort to snoop on citizens through their phones.",
      "\"Government has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,\" India's Ministry of Communications said in a statement Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The initial order, issued privately to phone makers by the ministry late last month, was leaked to Indian media outlets on Monday. It directed all phone makers to preinstall the Sanchar Saathi (which means Communication Partner in Hindi) app on new phones within 90 days, and also on older phones through software updates.",
      "The order, reported from Monday by numerous Indian media outlets and later acknowledged by the government, had asked manufacturers to ensure that the functions of the app could not be \"disabled or restricted.\"",
      "There was an immediate backlash on Monday, with opposition political parties quickly labelling the government software a \"snooping app\" and drawing parallels to Pegasus, the hacking spyware developed, marketed and licensed to governments around the world by the Israeli company NSO Group.",
      "On Tuesday, India's national Minister of Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia insisted to journalists outside the parliament that the Sanchar Sathi app was non-compulsory and in line with democratic principles. He said smartphone owners could activate the app at their convenience to access its benefits, and they could also delete it from devices at any time.",
      "He did not, however, say anything on Tuesday to deny or change the order to phone makers to ensure the app was pre-installed.",
      "On Wednesday, Scindia insisted that \"neither is snooping possible, nor it will be done\" with the app.",
      "While the order for it to be installed universally was revoked, the government continued defending the app on Wednesday, saying the intent had been to \"provide access to cybersecurity to all citizens,\" and insisting that it was \"secure and purely meant to help citizens.\"",
      "Opposition politicians say \"it is a snooping app\"",
      "The government's U-turn came after sharp criticism from opposition political parties and digital rights advocates.",
      "\"It is a snooping app. It's ridiculous. Citizens have the right to privacy. Everyone must have the right to privacy to send messages to family, friends, without the government looking at everything,\" Priyanka Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party, told reporters outside India's parliament on Tuesday.",
      "\"They brought in Pegasus and have been unable to keep it under control. MPs and MLAs all say that their phones are being tapped. For the last 11 years, basic rights of the Indians have been taken away... This is the real violation of National Security,\" said Renuka Chowdhury, another Congress member.",
      "Digital privacy advocates also raised concerns about the government order, saying it would breach citizens' right to privacy in a country with more than 1.2 billion cell phone users.",
      "\"No government will ever be expected to acknowledge that a government app is a snooping tool, even in China and Russia, where such apps have been mandated,\" Indian technology analyst Prasanto K. Roy told CBS News on Wednesday. \"A government statement alone is not adequate to inspire confidence in this.\"",
      "Roy said the government should restrict the default permissions settings that enable the app to access data on smartphones to the absolute minimum, and explain why those permissions were deemed necessary. He added that the code for the app should be open-source and published online, to enable independent security professionals to scrutinise it.",
      "\"In plain terms, this converts every smartphone sold in India into a vessel for state-mandated software that the user cannot meaningfully refuse, control, or remove,\" the Internet for Freedom organization said in a statement Tuesday, before the government revoked its order. \"For this to work in practice, the app will almost certainly need system level or root level access \u2026 so that it cannot be disabled. That design choice erodes the protections that normally prevent one app from peering into the data of others, and turns Sanchar Saathi into a permanent, non-consensual point of access sitting inside the operating system of every Indian smartphone user.\"",
      "Technology analyst Roy told CBS News the real issue was \"not about faith in the government's benevolence,\" but rather \"concerns about potential access to a wide range of data by many junior or mid-level officials in government or law enforcement,\" as there was no clarity about what data could be accessed via the app, or who would have access to it.",
      "Major phone makers did not publicly react to the government order, but the Reuters news agency reported that Apple had planned to refuse to comply.",
      "Indian government says it's just trying to help",
      "The government argues that the app allows users to track, block and recover lost or stolen smartphones using the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI), a unique code assigned to all handsets sold around the world.",
      "It also enables users to check how many unique mobile data connections are registered under their name, which it says will help people identify and disable fraudulent numbers and accounts opened by scammers.",
      "Other features include tools to report suspected fraudulent calls and to verify the authenticity of devices being used to make purchases, according to officials.",
      "The government said in its multiple statements that the app had already been downloaded 14 million times, and used to help trace 2.6 million lost or stolen phones. It said Sanchar Sathi had helped in the disconnection of over 4 million fraudulent connections, based on citizen reports.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. military's early September strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat \u2014 the first salvo in a months-long string of attacks \u2014 has drawn new scrutiny in recent days, as the White House confirmed that the vessel was struck twice.",
      "The confirmation followed a Washington Post report that the first boat was struck a second time, killing a pair of survivors \u2014 prompting calls for investigations and concerns in Congress that the follow-up strike may have constituted a war crime. A\u00a0Pentagon manual on the law of war says combatants that are \"wounded, sick, or shipwrecked\" no longer pose a threat and should not be attacked.",
      "The Trump administration has defended the series of boat strikes, casting them as a necessary tactic to stem the flow of narcotics from South America. But U.S. officials have not provided specific evidence that the vessels were smuggling drugs or posed a threat to the U.S. Some lawmakers from both parties have questioned the\u00a0 legality of the strikes.",
      "Here's what we know about the Sept. 2 strike and what the administration has said:",
      "Sept. 2: Trump says military \"shot out a boat\"",
      "President Trump announces to reporters during a Sept. 2 event that the U.S. had \"literally shot out a boat\" from Venezuela that he alleged was carrying drugs earlier in the day.",
      "In social media posts later that day, Mr. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the attack in further detail, and referred to it as a single strike.",
      "The president said on Truth Social that the strike had killed 11 alleged members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that his administration designated as a terrorist group earlier this year. Mr. Trump posted a 29-second video that showed one strike on a boat.",
      "Mr. Trump said the boat was headed to the U.S., but Rubio said later in the day that the drugs were \"probably headed to Trinidad or some other country in the Caribbean.\"",
      "The following day, Rubio stated that it was \"headed towards, eventually, the United States.\"",
      "Sept. 3: Hegseth says he \"watched it live\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes back on a Venezuelan official's claim that the video of the Sept. 2 strike may have been fake, telling \"Fox and Friends\" the following morning: \"I watched it live. We knew exactly who was in that boat. We knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Sept. 4: U.S. had \"absolute and complete authority\" to hit boat, Hegseth says",
      "Asked by CBS News what legal authority the Pentagon cited to strike the boat, Hegseth says: \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that.\" He called the importation of drugs to the U.S. an \"assault on the American people.\"",
      "Separately, the White House told Congress on Sept. 4 that it believes the strike was \"consistent with [the president's] responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests,\" according to a notification later obtained by CBS News.",
      "Sept. 11: Boat was allegedly turning around",
      "The New York Times and CBS News report the boat appeared to be turning around when it was hit. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the individuals onboard the boat saw a military aircraft overhead and attempted to turn back before the U.S. hit the boat.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement, \"The President acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring poison to our shores.\"",
      "Sept. 15: Another boat is hit",
      "Mr. Trump announces another strike against an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, killing three \"male terrorists.\"",
      "The administration later said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in a message to Congress justifying the Sept. 15 strike that was viewed by CBS News. It called the three individuals killed in the second strike \"unlawful combatants.\"",
      "In total, the U.S. has struck more than 20 boats between early September and mid-November, killing more than 80 people.",
      "Oct. 16: Key admiral announces retirement",
      "Hegseth announces that Adm. Alvin Holsey will retire as commander of U.S. Southern Command at year's end. Holsey was one year into his tenure overseeing the region where the boat strikes took place. Typically, combatant commanders serve for three years on average.",
      "Separately, CBS News reported that two people survived a strike on a boat in the Caribbean on Oct. 16. Mr. Trump later said the survivors would be returned to their countries of origin. The two, from Ecuador and Colombia, were repatriated within a few days of the strike.",
      "Nov. 28: Report says the first strike left survivors who were then killed in second attack",
      "The Washington Post reports that the Sept. 2 strike left two survivors, who clung to the boat's wreckage before dying in a follow-on attack. The Post reported that the second strike was conducted because Hegseth ordered everybody to be killed.",
      "Hegseth called the reporting \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory.\"",
      "\"The declared intent is to stop lethal drugs, destroy narco-boats, and kill the narco-terrorists who are poisoning the American people,\" Hegseth wrote on X. \"Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "He also defended the strikes' legality once again.",
      "In response, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee said in a joint statement on Nov. 28 that they would conduct \"vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\" Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement promising to gather a full accounting of the operation.",
      "Nov. 30: Senator says it may rise \"to the level of a war crime\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia says on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the reported follow-on strike \"rises to the level of a war crime if it's true,\" pointing to international and domestic laws on attacks against wounded combatants.",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, expresses similar concerns, saying, \"Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that \u2026 would be an illegal act.\"",
      "Nov. 30: Trump responds",
      "On Air Force One, the president tells reporters he \"wouldn't have wanted\" a second strike on the boat.",
      "He added that Hegseth said he didn't order a follow-on strike, and \"I believe him 100%.\"",
      "Dec. 1: Leavitt confirms a second strike",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirms that there was a follow-on strike, but denied that it was done at Hegseth's behest. She says Adm. Mitch Bradley, who led Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the operation, was authorized by Hegseth to conduct strikes.",
      "A reporter asked Leavitt: \"Does the administration deny that that second strike happened, or did it happen and the administration denies that Secretary Hegseth gave the order?\"",
      "She responded: \"The latter is true.\"",
      "Leavitt then read a prepared statement: \"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narcoterrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war. With respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Admiral Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes. Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law, directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated.\"",
      "Leavitt later told CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang that she \"would reject\" that Hegseth ever said that everyone in the boat on Sept. 2 should be killed.",
      "Dec. 1: Senate Armed Services chair says he expects to obtain all the audio and video from the strikes",
      "GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, tells reporters that he has spoken with Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he plans to talk with the admiral who led the operation. He said Hegseth \"did indicate\" that \"there was a second attack.\"",
      "But Wicker told reporters he did not have information on survivors who may have been killed. He said he expects to receive that information because \"we're going to have all of the audio and all of the video.\"",
      "Dec. 2: Hegseth says he didn't watch second strike and didn't see any survivors",
      "During a Cabinet meeting, Hegseth tells reporters he watched the first boat strike on Sept. 2 live, but had \"moved on to my next meeting\" before the boat was hit a second time.",
      "\"I watched that first strike live,\" Hegseth said. \"As you can imagine, at the Department of War, we've got a lot of things to do. So I didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs.\"",
      "He said he later learned that Bradley chose to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat,\" which Hegseth said was the right decision.",
      "Hegseth also said he did not \"personally see survivors\" following the first strike \"because the thing was on fire,\" calling the situation the \"fog of war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't know about the second strike\" when asked about his comment over the weekend that he wouldn't have wanted a follow-on attack.",
      "\"To me, it was an attack. It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes,\" the president said.",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Hegseth defended the administration's strategy of striking vessels, saying, \"We've only just begun striking narco-boats and putting narco-terrorists at the bottom of the ocean.\"",

      "A top aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said there is still \"much work to be done\" after President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, amid a push by Mr. Trump to end the\u00a0war in Ukraine.",
      "The meeting lasted roughly five hours and came on the heels of talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a top Putin official, told reporters following Tuesday's meeting that the talks were \"constructive, very useful and substantive,\" but said a compromise to the lingering territorial issues in Ukraine wasn't found.",
      "\"The territorial issue, naturally, is the most important for us, and for the Americans too. A compromise option has not yet been found, but some American developments look more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" he said. \"Some formulations that were proposed to us are acceptable to us.\"",
      "\"We are no closer to resolving the crisis in Ukraine, and there is much work to be done,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Ushakov said that Moscow was given four more documents in addition to the\u00a0original 28-point plan\u00a0the Trump administration presented last month, but did not elaborate on what those documents contained.",
      "Ushakov said both Russia and the U.S. agreed not to disclose the specific details of the talks. No direct talks between Putin and Mr. Trump are currently planned, but Putin asked Witkoff and Kushner to relay \"important political signals\" to Mr. Trump, Ushakov said.",
      "Witkoff and Kushner are set to return to the U.S. to discuss the meeting with Mr. Trump, and will then get back in touch with Russian officials by phone, Ushakov said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who took part in weekend talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida, previously said the conversations were \"another very productive session,\" but \"there are a lot of moving parts.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had told reporters after Sunday's talks, \"I think that there's a good chance we can make a deal.\"",
      "The original U.S.-backed\u00a0peace proposal\u00a0to end Russia's war on Ukraine that was unveiled last month has gone through changes after the initial plan was criticized by some as being too favorable to Russia, Mr. Trump told reporters over the weekend. One provision that drew heavy pushback from U.S. and European officials called for Ukraine to cede territory it currently controls in Donetsk to Russia.",
      "\"They're making concessions,\" Mr. Trump said of the Russians. \"They're big concessions. They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a Tuesday news conference that the plan had been whittled down to 20 points following talks in Geneva and Florida. He said later on the social media platform Telegram that Ukraine would \"wait for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia.\"",
      "\"We will receive certain signals. If the signals work, if it is fair play with our partners, then perhaps we will meet with the American delegation very soon,\" he said, adding, \"I am ready to meet with President Trump. Everything depends on today's talks.\"",
      "Putin has previously called the proposals a \"set of issues put forward for discussion\" as opposed to a firm draft agreement.",
      "Last week, a U.S. official told CBS News\u00a0that Ukraine had \"agreed to a peace deal,\" with the official and Ukrainian national security adviser Rustem Umerov saying a common understanding on a proposal had been reached, with details still to be worked out.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed optimism over the development, saying there were only a \"few remaining points of disagreement.\" Moscow, however, said it was \"premature\" to say the two sides were close to a peace deal.",

    "story": [
      "A former Honduran president convicted of helping to smuggle 400 tons of cocaine into the United States has left prison after being pardoned by President Donald Trump. The U.S. Bureau of Prisons confirmed his release in a statement to the Associated Press.",
      "Juan Orlando Hernandez\u00a0was released from a federal prison in West Virginia on Monday and was \"once again a free man,\" his wife, Ana Garc\u00eda, announced on social media. Garc\u00eda thanked Mr. Trump for pardoning Hern\u00e1ndez via the social platform X early Tuesday.",
      "\"After almost four years of pain, of waiting and difficult challenges, my husband Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez RETURNED to being a free man, thanks to the presidential pardon granted by President Donald Trump,\" Garc\u00eda's post said. She included a picture of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons listing for Hern\u00e1ndez indicating his release.",
      "Mr. Trump's controversial pardon came as the U.S. president is simultaneously ordering the bombing of boats in the Caribbean allegedly carrying drugs. He is also heavily backing a candidate from Hernandez's party in Honduras's tense, ongoing presidential election vote count.",
      "Mr. Trump explained his decision\u00a0on social media\u00a0by posting that \"according to many people that I greatly respect,\" Hern\u00e1ndez was \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\"",
      "In March of last year, Hernandez was convicted in U.S. court\u00a0of conspiring to import cocaine\u00a0into the U.S. He had served two terms as the leader of the Central American nation of roughly 10 million people. Hern\u00e1ndez has been appealing his conviction and serving time at the U.S. Penitentiary, Hazelton in West Virginia.",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's announcement, Hernandez's wife and children gathered on the steps on their home in Tegucigalpa and kneeled in prayer, thanking God that Hernandez would return to their family after almost four years apart.",
      "It was the same home that Honduran authorities hauled him out of in 2022 just months after leaving office. He was extradited to the United States to stand trial.",
      "Trump's pardon drew criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, was critical of the pardon, saying Sunday on social media, \"Why would we pardon [Hernandez] and then go after Maduro for running drugs into the United States? Lock up every drug runner! Don't understand why he is being pardoned.\"",
      "\"This is shocking,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat of Virginia,\u00a0said of the pardon\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"He was convicted in a federal court in the United States,\" said Kaine, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. \"One of the bits of evidence was his statement that was picked up by those near to him that he wanted to 'shove drugs up the nose of gringos' and flood the United States with cocaine, more than 400 tons. He was the leader of one of the largest criminal enterprises that has ever been subject to a conviction in U.S. courts, and less than one year into his sentence, President Trump is pardoning him, suggesting that President Trump cares nothing about narcotrafficking. Suggesting possibly that pardons are now for sale by this White House.\"",
      "In remarks on the House floor Tuesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, said, \"What message does pardoning this criminal send to parents who have lost children to narcotics, to law enforcement officers risking everything to stop the flow of deadly drugs?\"",
      "\"This disgraceful pardon should be met with bipartisan condemnation,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the move to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday, claiming, \"Many of the people of Honduras said it was a Biden setup. ... He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country. And they said it was a Biden administration setup, and I looked at the facts and I agreed with them.\"",
      "When asked what evidence he had seen to indicate Hernandez's case was a setup, Mr. Trump said, \"You take any country you want, if somebody sells drugs in that country, that doesn't mean you arrest the president and put him in jail for the rest of his life.\"",

      "The plans are preliminary and the number of countries added to the list could change, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. CNN reported\u00a0on Tuesday morning that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was recommending expanding the travel ban to between 30 and 32 countries.",
      "After a meeting with President Trump on Monday, Noem said on X\u00a0that she had urged him to impose \"a full travel ban on every damn country that's been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.\"",
      "\"Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom\u2014not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to AMERICANS,\" Noem wrote in her X post.",

It has halted all visa and immigration processing for Afghan nationals, paused asylum case decisions for all nationalities and ordered a full-scale review of green card cases involving immigrants from the 19 countries currently subject to the travel ban.",
      "The plans being considered would significantly broaden the scope of a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump over the summer that partially or fully barred legal immigration and travel from 19 countries, most of them in Asia and Africa.",
      "That proclamation, referred to as a travel ban by supporters and critics alike, imposed a near-total restriction on the entry of people from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "At the time, Mr. Trump said the proclamation was needed to mitigate concerns about terrorist activity in some of the nations on the list, the inability to properly vet some of the affected nationals and the refusal by certain countries to cooperate on deportation flights from the U.S.",

    "summary": "As President Trump pushes Ukraine to accept a Russian landgrab in exchange for peace, a wounded soldier asks, \"How much more can we give?\"",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian soldier Pavlo Martsenyuk has lost count of the friends and comrades he's lost since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of his country almost four years ago. The 34-year-old says he does his best to keep alive the memories of the men he fought alongside.",
      "Speaking from a rehabilitation center in the western city of Lviv called \"Unbroken Hospital,\" he told CBS News about the long, painful process of recovering from the impact of an anti-tank mine explosion that robbed him of his sight in both eyes.",
      "\"I couldn't calm myself down and control my stream of thoughts,\" Martsenyuk said. \"Everything was buzzing, until I started working actively with my mental health.\"",
      "A year on, doctors have reconstructed his face and he's adapting to what he calls \"an entirely new life.\"",
      "Martsenyuk says his priority now is to carry on as a civilian and serve as an example to his children. He's also a living example of the human costs of Russia's ongoing invasion, and he believes many people outside Ukraine don't really understand his country's sacrifice, or the broader importance of its fight.",
      "President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff were due to meet Russia's Vladimir Putin on Tuesday in Moscow to discuss a U.S.-backed proposal to end the war. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, is holding meetings with various European leaders in the hope of shoring up continued support for his country's defense.",
      "Details from the high-level discussions remain vague, but one key obstacle to a deal that has emerged is Ukraine's resistance to a Trump administration proposal for it to accept ceding some territory to Russia in exchange for peace.",
      "Mr. Trump argued over the weekend that his peace proposal did include Russia \"making concessions.\"",
      "\"They're big concessions,\" he told reporters. \"They stop fighting, and they don't take any more land.\"",
      "Zelenskyy and some of his European supporters have spoken out against this approach, arguing that granting Russia dominion over any currently occupied Ukrainian land would set a dangerous precedent, effectively rewarding Putin for a unilateral, unprovoked invasion.",
      "For Martsenyuk, who bears the scars of this long conflict, it's a difficult question.",
      "\"We have already given up territory \u2014   we have given part of ourselves. How much more can we give?\" he asks.",
      "European leaders, including Poland's, have recently alluded to the risks highlighted by Europe's 20th century history of appeasing the unilateral landgrabs of autocrats.",
      "\"Can't we analyze history? It all smells like something done before,\" Martsenyuk said.",
      "In late October, with President Trump pushing hard for Ukraine to make concessions to get a peace deal done \u2014   though without any clear requests for Russia to bend on its key demands \u2014   Polish Minister Donald Tusk warned: \"None of us should put pressure on Zelenskyy when it comes to territorial concessions.\"",
      "\"We should all put pressure on Russia to stop its aggression. Appeasement never was a road to a just and lasting peace,\" said the social media post by Tusk \u2014 whose nation was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II.",
      "But Martsenyuk is also keenly aware that with the high cost being paid by his country every day, Ukraine will need help to continue withstanding Russia's onslaught, let alone repel it.",
      "Ukrainian authorities have not released official numbers of soldiers killed in combat since the start of the invasion, but an investigation released in June by the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that between 60,000 and 100,000 of the country's troops have died.",
      "\"Pity is not needed,\" he said. \"Understanding is needed. There is very little understanding.\"",

      "\"I was so nervous. I immediately got my clothes, phone and went downstairs,\" he said.",
      "He never imagined that the blaze at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong would spread so quickly. It tore through bamboo scaffolding, mesh netting covering it, and then foam window coverings that had adorned the sprawling complex's eight buildings for ongoing renovation work.",
      "\"I got outside and saw a big fire,\" he told CBS News on Monday, as the official death toll from the blaze climbed to over 150. \"Fire was spreading everywhere, and I could hear the bamboo exploding. The fire spread to the other block. The mesh caught alight.\"",
      "That other block was his own building, where he knew his wife was still upstairs. He watched as the blaze spread up the sides, quickly blocking the main lobby.",
      "\"I called my wife immediately and said there's a big fire and we have to go now,\" the 67-year-old recalled through tears. \"I told my wife, don't come down.\"",
      "He had hoped that firefighters would be able to get the blaze under control before it was too late.",
      "On the other end of the phone, his distraught wife, Bai Shui Lin, told him she couldn't move through the thick smoke.",
      "\"Then there was so much noise,\" he said. \"I can't hear her anymore \u2026 only noise. And then I can't contact her anymore. That's the last call I had with her.\"",
      "\"I kept waiting, hoping the fire would be put out. I thought maybe only the outside would be affected. But the fire just kept getting bigger,\" he said.",
      "As the blaze spread to seven of the buildings on the complex, Yip watched from behind a police cordon for any sign of his wife being carried out, but he never saw her.",
      "He said he pored over lists of photos and names of victims for days as the death toll mounted, giving her description to nearby hospitals in the hope that she had been rescued.",
      "\"I couldn't find my wife,\" he said through tears. \"I tried everything.\"",
      "Five days later, police confirmed his worst fears in a phone call on Monday. Bai, his wife of 40 years, never made it out of their building.",
      "The couple's two sons had to confirm her identification, but her remains were burned so badly that authorities used an ID card found in her purse to verify it was her.",
      "Yip said she had gone door to door, warning neighbors of the fire that had spread to their building. He said she helped at least three other families make it out before it was too late.",
      "Both of their sons survived the catastrophic fire, but Yip said he was struggling with guilt over the loss of his wife.",
      "\"If I'd asked her to leave a minute earlier, I think she would have survived,\" he said. \"But we know her. She wouldn't have left without warning others.\"",
      "Hong Kong authorities said at least 30 people were still missing on Monday, and recovery teams were still sweeping the seven charred buildings to find victims who failed to escape.",

      "\"And maybe overexposure could be damaging,\" he added. \"I think, if anything, I had somewhat of an instinct early on about overexposure. Granted, it was a different time. It was a time where I watched actors that kind of disappeared their personal life, and you didn\u2019t know much about them. It\u2019s much different now with social media.

      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, the researchers acknowledged.",
      "The sample size was relatively small, consisting of 11 middle-aged adults with obesity and hypertension. It was also a two-week period, which means researchers could measure only short-term changes.",

      "BRAIN HEALTH WARNING SIGN COULD BE HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT, SAY RESEARCHERS",

      "The study pinpointed the following five broad phases of brain structure, separated into four \"turning points\" between birth and death.",
      "1. Childhood: Birth to 9 years old",
      "In the childhood era of the brain, rapid growth and \"network consolidation\" occurs, including the expansion of grey and white matter and the stabilization of the brain surface. Grey matter is responsible for processing information in the brain, while white matter enables communication, according to the researchers.",
      "There is also an overproduction of neuron connectors, or synapses, which are whittled down so only the most active ones survive.",
      "BRAIN AGING MAY SLOW WITH GREEN TEA, WALNUTS AND TINY SWAMP PLANT, STUDY FINDS",
      "\"Across the whole brain, connections rewire in the same pattern from birth until about 9 years old,\" the researchers noted.",
      "At 9, the brain experiences a \"step-change\" in cognitive capacity and an increased risk of mental health disorders.",
      "2. Adolescence: 9 to 32 years old",
      "In the adolescence stage, which lasts on average until the age of 32, the growth of white matter continues, while the brain\u2019s communication networks become more refined and efficient.",
      "There is also an increase in connectivity, which enhances cognitive development and learning, the study found.",
      "The first era of brain development occurs between birth and 9 years old, involving an influx in neuron connectors and brain matter. (iStock)",
      "These developments peak in the early 30s, which is defined as the \"strongest topological turning point\" of the entire lifespan.",
      "Around age 32, the \"most directional changes in wiring and the largest overall shift in trajectory\" occur, lead researcher Dr. Alexa Mousley, a Gates Cambridge Scholar, wrote in a statement.",
      "\"While puberty offers a clear start, the end of adolescence is much harder to pin down scientifically,\" she said. \"Based purely on neural architecture, we found that adolescent-like changes in brain structure end around the early 30s.\"",
      "3. Adulthood: 32 to 66 years old",
      "Adulthood is the longest era of brain development, lasting more than three decades. In this stage, the brain architecture stabilizes with no major turning points, corresponding with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers echoed from other studies.",
      "Meanwhile, regions of the brain during adulthood become more compartmentalized or \"segregated.\"",
      "4. Early aging: 66 to 83 years old",
      "Around year 66, there are no major structural shifts, but researchers still pointed to \"meaningful changes\" in the pattern of brain networks. This re-organization is most likely related to general aging, coinciding with reduced connectivity and the degeneration of white matter.",
      "According to Mousley, people at this age face an increased risk of health conditions that can affect the brain, like hypertension.",
      "Adulthood in the brain corresponds with a \"plateau in intelligence and personality,\" the researchers noted. (iStock)",
      "5. Late aging: 83 years and older",

      "\"Indeed, differences in brain wiring predict difficulties with attention, language, memory and a whole host of different behaviors,\" he said.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, commented that although he agrees with the concept of stages of brain aging, the \"segregation they proposed is a little bit broad.\"",

      "EXCLUSIVE: The country's four largest public-sector unions spent a combined $915 million on elections and progressive political activism during the 2024 election cycle, 86% of which came from member dues.",
      "The Commonwealth Foundation, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit promoting free-market policies, highlighted the massive political spending by the National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in a new report released this week.",
      "The foundation published a similar report during the 2022 election cycle that found all four of these unions spent $708 million on progressive politics,",
      "The report's findings, particularly that 86% of the unions' nearly $1 billion in political spending stems from membership dues, underscore criticism that these entities work more to push a political agenda than support their members.",
      "FEDERAL PROBE DEMANDS CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION EXPLAIN MISSING FINANCIAL AUDITS SINCE 2020",
      "\"What they're doing when they're making these political investments is they're trying to get people into office that will raise taxes and increase the size and scope of government,\" public sector unions expert Aaron Withe told Fox News Digital. \"That's the way that it's been working for decades. That's why you see the government grows every single year. That's why you see taxes go up most every year as well.\"",
      "Withe, a critic of both public- and private-sector unions, said private-sector unions at least have an incentive structure based on a company's or industry's bottom line, but public-sector unions, Withe argued, are incentivized by raising taxes and growing government.",
      "\"When you look at union spending in politics, you have to remember that their goal \u2014 their primary purpose is a business \u2014 so they're there to grow revenue. They're there to gain more revenue than the year previously,\" Withe pointed out. \"The difference with the government union is that that revenue comes from public employees. And the way that you hire more public employees is by raising taxes on the private sector so that you can hire more bureaucrats.\"",
      "David Osborne, senior director of labor policy for the Commonwealth Foundation and co-author of the report, said \"the big question\" from his report is whether rank-and-file union members are aware of how their money is actually being spent.",
      "\"Years ago, [union members] could expect union executives to use dues to drive member services, including contract negotiations and grievance processing,\" Osborne said. \"Now, union members are unwittingly propping up left-leaning candidates and progressive causes like abortion, critical race theory and defunding the police.\"",

      "According to the Commonwealth Foundation's report, the findings show that approximately 25% of the group's total spending \u2014 or $642 million \u2014 goes toward \"representational activities,\" which the report describes as \"the spending category most closely tied to membership support.\" Meanwhile, the unions also spent about a combined 33% of their total spending \u2014 or $845 million \u2014 on general overhead, union administration, staff benefits and other cost categories \"linked to basic operations.\"",
      "But spending on elections and progressive political activism surpassed both those categories. Collectively, the unions spent around $755 million on federal elections and national progressive politics, while their state-level affiliates combined to spend another $160 million on state races and ideological causes. Of that spending, $650 million, or 86%, originated from union membership dues, according to the Commonwealth Foundation.",
      "The report notes the unions also collect voluntary political action committee (PAC) deductions from members and their families, which allows the unions to collect money that can then go directly to candidates, something that is not supposed to be done with members' dues money. The union's federal PAC spending accounted for 14% of the group's political spending, according to the report.",

      "\"Government unions\u2019 heavy use of membership dues money for politics \u2014 more than what they collectively spent on representational activities \u2014 underlines a disturbing trend: the growing, overt reliance by union officials to spend member dues rather than political action committee funds on their political and ideological agendas,\" the Commonwealth Foundation says in its new report.",
      "\"Yet, much of this spending is possible only because of the lack of accountability and control over what powerful union executives do with members\u2019 dues. Union dues, not the separately collected PAC funds, are the overwhelming power behind \u2014 86 percent \u2014 of union political spending.",
      "\"Few members are aware that union leaders launder much of their dues through super PACs and 527s to back political projects. Even fewer members can effect change within their union to stop it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "Scientists in Switzerland have built a robot as small as a grain of sand. Surgeons control it with magnets and move it through blood vessels to place medicine exactly where it is needed.",
      "Bradley J. Nelson, an author of the paper in Science and a professor of robotics at ETH Zurich, said the team has barely begun to understand what this technology will make possible. He expects surgeons will find many new uses once they see how precise the tool becomes inside the body.",

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How the magnet steered microrobot works",
      "The robot sits inside a capsule that surgeons guide with magnetic fields. They steer it with a handheld controller that feels familiar and intuitive. Surrounding the patient are six electromagnetic coils. Each coil generates a magnetic force that can push or pull the capsule in any direction.",
      "By combining the fields, surgeons can navigate through blood vessels or cerebrospinal fluid with accuracy. The magnetic force is strong enough to move the capsule even against the flow of blood. This control lets the robot reach places most tools cannot access safely.",
      "The capsule is made from safe materials used in other medical devices such as tantalum, which gives it visibility on X-rays. It also contains iron oxide nanoparticles developed at ETH Zurich. These particles respond to magnets and help the capsule move. Gelatin binds the nanoparticles, the metal and the medication together.",
      "When the capsule reaches its target, surgeons can dissolve the capsule on command. Doctors track every move in real time with X-ray imaging.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "Why targeted drug delivery matters",
      "Many drugs fail during development because they spread through the entire body rather than staying at the site that needs treatment. That spread causes unwanted side effects. Even simple medicines like aspirin show how this works. You take a pill for a headache, and yet the drug flows everywhere.",
      "The materials inside the capsule work together to respond to magnetic fields, carry medication and dissolve once it reaches its target. (iStock)",
      "A microrobot that can deliver medication directly to a tumor, blood vessel or abnormal tissue could solve that problem. ETH Zurich researchers say the capsule may help treat aneurysms, aggressive brain cancers, and arteriovenous malformations. Tests in pigs and silicone blood vessel models show encouraging results. The team believes this system may reach human clinical trials within three to five years.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If this technology succeeds, future treatments may feel very different from the ones you get today. Instead of receiving medicine that affects your whole body, you may receive therapy that reaches only the exact spot that needs attention. That shift could reduce side effects, shorten recovery times and open the door to new drug designs that were once too risky to use.",
      "Precision care also has the potential to make complex procedures safer for patients who cannot tolerate invasive surgery. Families dealing with aggressive cancers or delicate vascular conditions may eventually benefit from approaches that rely on targeted tools instead of broad systemic drugs.",
      "ROBOTS PERFORM LIKE HUMAN SURGEONS BY JUST WATCHING VIDEOS",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The idea of a grain-sized robot navigating the bloodstream sounds bold, yet the science behind it is moving forward fast. Researchers have shown that the capsule moves with precision, tracks well under imaging and dissolves on command. Early results hint at a future where drug delivery becomes far more focused and far less harmful. This work still sits in the early stages, but it already points toward a new era of medical robotics.",

      "How the researchers scraped 3.5B WhatsApp numbers",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Researchers discovered that weak API limits made it possible to scrape billions of WhatsApp numbers. (Getty Images)",
      "As reported by Bleeping Computer, the entire incident started with WhatsApp's GetDeviceList API. This is the endpoint the app uses when you add a number to your contacts. It tells WhatsApp to check if that number has an account and what devices are linked to it. The problem was that the API had no meaningful rate limiting. In simple terms, the system didn't slow down or block repeated requests, which opened the door for mass enumeration.",
      "Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research decided to test how far they could push this. Using only five authenticated sessions and a single university server, they started hammering WhatsApp's servers with queries. They expected to get blocked fast, but WhatsApp didn't react at all.",
      "That's how they were able to check more than 100 million phone numbers per hour. After generating a global pool of 63 billion possible mobile numbers, they ran the list through the API and confirmed 3.5 billion active WhatsApp accounts.",
      "Researchers managed to scrape more than just phone numbers",
      "The researchers didn't stop at confirming account existence. They used other WhatsApp endpoints like GetUserInfo, GetPrekeys and FetchPicture to pull more details. This included profile photos, \"about\" text, device information and public keys. A test run in the United States alone downloaded 77 million profile photos without hitting any limits, many with clear images of people's faces. Public \"about\" sections often revealed personal info or links to other profiles. When compared to Facebook's 2021 scrape, they found that 58% of leaked Facebook numbers were still active on WhatsApp years later. That's what makes phone-number leaks so damaging. They stay useful to attackers long after the initial breach.",
      "RUSSIAN LAWMAKERS CLAIM WHATSAPP IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, SHOULD PREPARE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY",
      "It's important to note that this study was done by researchers who haven't released the data. They also reported the issue to WhatsApp. The company has since added rate-limiting protections to prevent similar abuse from happening again. Still, the findings show how easily threat actors could have done the same thing if they had found the loophole first.",
      "Why this keeps happening across major platforms",
      "Weak or nonexistent API rate limits have caused several major data leaks in recent years, and WhatsApp isn\u2019t the only example. In 2021, attackers abused Facebook\u2019s \"Add Friend\" feature by uploading contact lists and checking which numbers matched active accounts. The API lacked proper safeguards, so they scraped 533 million profiles. Meta later confirmed the incident as automated scraping, and the Irish DPC fined the company \u20ac265 million.",
      "Twitter had a similar problem when attackers used an API bug to match phone numbers and email addresses to 54 million accounts. Dell also reported that 49 million customer records were scraped after attackers took advantage of an unprotected API endpoint.",
      "All of these cases share the same root cause. APIs that allow account lookups or data queries end up being easy to attack when they don't limit how often someone can access them. One unchecked feature can turn into a pipeline for mass data collection.",
      "7 steps you can take to keep your WhatsApp data safe",
      "If your phone number ends up in one of these massive scrapes, you can't pull it back, but you can make sure it's far less useful to anyone trying to target you. Here are a few steps that help you stay safer.",
      "Turn on 2FA for WhatsApp and every other important account. Even if someone has your number, they can't break in without that second verification step. It also protects you from SIM-swap attempts since thieves can't access your accounts with just a password.",
      "A simple automated script pulled phone data at a massive scale without triggering alerts. (eyecrave productions/Getty Images)",
      "A password manager keeps every login unique. If attackers try to pair your scraped number with credential-stuffing attacks, reused passwords won't give them an easy win. Strong, random passwords shut down a whole category of automated attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Opt out of data brokers and people-search sites when you can. The less public information attackers can tie to your number, the harder it is for them to craft convincing phishing messages or identity-based scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "WhatsApp might have fixed the issue, but the bigger problem is still out there. Any platform that exposes an API without proper rate limits is leaving a window open for someone with the right tools and enough time. This scrape shows you how quickly that window can turn into a firehose of personal data. Until API security becomes a priority across the board, you'll keep seeing leaks like this repeat on bigger and bigger scales.",

      "When Xpeng unveiled its Next Gen Iron humanoid recently, the robot glided across the stage with movement so fluid that the crowd froze. Many viewers thought they saw an actor in a suit. Clips spread online within hours, and people everywhere claimed the same thing: it looked too human to be a machine.",
      "The reaction spread fast, so Xpeng's CEO He Xiaopeng returned to the stage one day later with a plan to settle the argument. He cut into Iron's leg to show its internal machinery. It felt theatrical but also necessary to end the rumor that a human controlled the robot from inside.",
      "The demonstration showed Iron was a real machine with complex systems beneath its flexible skin.",

      "Inside the next-gen iron humanoid",
      "He shared how his robotics team stayed awake through the night, seeing viewers accuse them of staging a stunt. After the reveal, Iron walked again in front of the crowd without a human inside. The moment closed the debate and highlighted how far the company has come since its first model in 2024.",
      "The latest Iron uses a humanoid spine with bionic muscles and flexible skin. It moves with 82 degrees of freedom, and its human-sized hands include 22 degrees of freedom supported by a tiny harmonic joint engineered by the company. The robot runs on all solid-state batteries that keep the body light and strong.",
      "Iron also uses Xpeng's second-generation VLA model. Three Turing chips with 2,250 TOPS of power support tasks like conversations, walking and natural interactions. It responds in ways that feel closer to a person than a robot.",
      "Xpeng says future versions will offer different body shapes. That claim hints at customizable designs when these units reach consumers.",
      "SMART FABRIC MUSCLES COULD CHANGE HOW WE MOVE",
      "To silence the rumors, the team cut open Iron\u2019s leg onstage and revealed the machinery beneath its flexible skin. (Xpeng)",
      "A step toward a future of humanoid robots",
      "Xpeng's long-term vision goes far beyond a single showcase moment. The company plans to place the Next Gen Iron model in real-world environments. Early units will focus on commercial roles such as tour guides, shopping guides and customer service helpers. These placements allow the robots to interact with large crowds, gather feedback and refine their behavior in dynamic public spaces.",
      "This rollout forms part of what Xpeng describes as a gradual path toward mass production. The team aims to reach large-scale manufacturing by the end of 2026. That milestone could introduce hundreds or even thousands of humanoid units into select venues. Businesses may adopt them to manage foot traffic, assist guests or support basic retail tasks.",
      "While the company talks openly about commercial integration, the timeline for home use remains unclear. They have not shared when consumers will be able to buy a version suited for daily household tasks. Engineers still need to address safety, privacy and reliability standards before a humanoid can operate inside private homes.",
      "Even so, this moment signals a clear shift: robots that move and react in a lifelike way are no longer far-off ideas. They are stepping into public spaces where people will see them operate up close. This shift could reshape how we all view service work and personal assistance in the years ahead.",

      "The exposed frame shows Iron\u2019s bionic muscles, joints and wiring, giving a clear look at the advanced engineering that powers its lifelike movement. (Xpeng)",

      "Humanoid robots are moving from concept to reality. You may soon see them in museums or stores. Their skills could speed up service and reduce wait times. These robots may also raise new questions about safety, privacy and comfort. Change happens fast, and this moment marks a major shift in how robots blend into daily life.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss a new iPhone update that will filter out spam messages and tips to protect yourself from A.I. cyber attacks.",
      "Cybercriminals keep finding new angles to get your attention, and email remains one of their favorite tools. Over the years, you have probably seen everything from fake courier notices to AI-generated scams that feel surprisingly polished. Filters have improved, but attackers have learned to adapt. The latest technique takes aim at something you rarely think about: the subject line itself. Researchers have found a method that hides tiny, invisible characters inside the subject so automated systems fail to flag the message. It sounds subtle, but it is quickly becoming a serious problem.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "Cybercriminals are using invisible Unicode characters to disguise phishing email subject lines, allowing dangerous scams to slip past filters. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "How the new trick works",
      "Researchers recently uncovered phishing campaigns that embed soft hyphens between every letter of an email subject. These are invisible Unicode characters that normally help with text formatting. They do not show up in your inbox, but they completely throw off keyword-based filters. Attackers use MIME encoded-word formatting to slip these characters into the subject. By encoding it in UTF-8 and Base64, they can weave these hidden characters through the entire phrase.",
      "One analyzed email decoded to \"Your Password is About to Expire\" with a soft hyphen tucked between every character. To you, it looks normal. To a security filter, it looks scrambled, with no clear keyword to match. The attackers then use the same trick in the body of the email, so both layers slide through detection. The link leads to a fake login page sitting on a compromised domain, designed to harvest your credentials.",
      "If you have ever tried spotting a phishing email, this one still follows the usual script. It builds urgency, claims something is about to expire and points you to a login page. The difference is in how neatly it dodges the filters you trust.",
      "Why this phishing technique is super dangerous",
      "Most phishing filters rely on pattern recognition. They look for suspicious words, common phrases and structure. They also scan for known malicious domains. By splitting every character with invisible symbols, attackers break up these patterns. The text becomes readable for you but unreadable for automated systems. This creates a quiet loophole where old phishing templates suddenly become effective again.",
      "The worrying part is how easy this method is to copy. The tools needed to encode these messages are widely available. Attackers can automate the process and churn out bulk campaigns with little extra effort. Since the characters are invisible in most email clients, even tech-savvy users do not notice anything odd at first glance.",
      "Security researchers point out that this method has appeared in email bodies for years, but using it in the subject line is less common. That makes it harder for existing filters to catch. Subject lines also play a key role in shaping your first impression. If the subject looks familiar and urgent, you are more likely to open the email, which gives the attacker a head start.",
      "How to spot a phishing email before you click",
      "Phishing emails often look legitimate, but the links inside them tell a different story. Scammers hide dangerous URLs behind familiar-looking text, hoping you will click without checking. One safe way to preview a link is by using a private email service that shows the real destination before your browser loads it.",
      "Our top-rated private email provider recommendation includes malicious link protection that reveals full URLs before opening them. This gives you a clear view of where a link leads before anything can harm your device. It also offers strong privacy features like no ads, no tracking, encrypted messages and unlimited disposable aliases.",

      "A password manager helps you create strong, unique passwords for every account. Even if a phishing email fools you, the attacker cannot use your password elsewhere because each one is different. Most password managers also warn you when a site looks suspicious.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Turning on 2FA adds a second step to your login process. Even if someone steals your password, they still need the verification code on your phone. This stops most phishing attempts from going any further.",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Updates often include security fixes that help block malicious scripts and unsafe redirects. Attackers take advantage of older systems because they are easier to trick. Staying updated keeps you ahead of known weaknesses.",
      "Many email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) allow you to tighten spam filtering settings. This won't catch every soft-hyphen scam, but it improves your odds and reduces risky emails overall.",

It's safe to say filters and scanners are also improving, but they cannot catch everything, especially when the text they see is not the same as what you see. Staying safe comes down to a mix of good habits, the right tools, and a little skepticism whenever an email pushes you to act quickly. If you slow down, double-check the details, and follow the steps that strengthen your accounts, you make it much harder for anyone to fool you.",

      "Why this setting matters",
      "Apps that update behind the scenes use data and power even when you are not opening them. When you switch the feature to Wi-Fi only, you slow down that background drain. It helps save mobile data. It can also help extend battery life because apps refresh less often.",
      "What Background App Refresh does",
      "Background App Refresh lets apps update content while you use other apps or leave your phone locked. When you return to an app, it is already refreshed and ready. That convenience comes with a cost. Each refresh uses data and battery power. By limiting this feature to Wi-Fi, you keep apps updated without using your mobile plan.",

      "A new phishing scam is getting a lot of attention because it uses real Apple Support tickets to trick people into giving up their accounts. Broadcom's Eric Moret shared how he nearly lost his entire Apple account after trusting what looked like official communication. He described the full experience in a detailed post on Medium, where he walked through the scam step by step.",
      "This scheme stands out because the scammers relied on Apple's own support system to make their messages look legitimate. They created an experience that felt polished and professional from the first alert to the final phone call. Here's how the scam unfolded.",

      "Scammers are exploiting real Apple Support tickets to trick users into handing over their accounts, experts warn. (Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam starts",
      "Moret first received a flood of alerts. These included two-factor authentication notifications that claimed someone was trying to access his iCloud account. Within minutes, he got phone calls from calm, helpful callers who claimed to be Apple agents ready to fix the issue.",
      "The twist is how convincing the entire setup felt. The scammers were able to exploit a flaw in Apple's Support system that lets anyone create a genuine support ticket without verification. They opened a real Apple Support case in his name, which triggered official emails from an Apple domain. This built instant trust and lowered Moret's guard.",
      "How scammers gained access to the account",
      "During a 25-minute call, the fake agents guided Moret through what they said would secure his account. They walked him through the steps to reset his iCloud password. They also told him a link would follow so he could close the case.",
      "That link took him to a fake site called appeal apple dot com. The page looked official and claimed his account was being secured. It then told him to enter a six-digit code sent by text to finish the process.",
      "When Moret entered that code, the scammers got exactly what they needed to sign into his account.",
      "He then got an alert that his Apple ID had been used to sign into a Mac mini he did not own. That confirmed the takeover attempt. Even though the scammer on the phone said this was normal, he trusted his instinct. He reset his password again, which kicked them out and stopped the attack.",

      "How to protect yourself from the Apple Support ticket scam",
      "This type of scam works because it feels real. The messages look official, and the callers sound trained. Still, you can stay safer by watching out for signs that something is off.",
      "Scammers created a real-looking ticket to make the entire experience seem legitimate. You can confirm what's real by checking directly with Apple. Sign in at appleid.apple.com or open the Apple Support app to view your recent cases. If the case number isn't listed there, the message is fake, even if the email comes from an Apple domain.",
      "Never stay on a call that you did not initiate. Scammers rely on long conversations to build trust and pressure you into quick decisions. Hang up right away and call Apple Support directly at 1-800-275-2273 or through the Support app. A real agent will quickly confirm whether anything is wrong.",
      "If something feels off, look at the devices signed into your account. Go to\u00a0Settings, tap your\u00a0name and scroll to see all devices\u00a0linked to your Apple ID. Remove anything you don't recognize. This step can stop attackers fast if they've managed to get in.",
      "No real support agent will ever ask for your two-factor authentication codes. Treat any request for these codes as a major warning.",
      "Look closely at URLs. Fake sites often add extra words or change formatting to appear real. Apple will never send you to a site like appeal apple dot com.",

      "Strong antivirus software can spot dangerous links, unsafe sites, and fake support messages before you tap them. Anti-phishing tools are especially important with scams like this one since the attackers used a fake site and real ticket emails to trick victims.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

The best defense is to stay alert and take a moment before responding to anything unexpected. When you slow down, double-check support tickets, and never share verification codes, you make yourself far harder to fool. Adding layers like antivirus protection and data removal services also gives you more control over what attackers can access. These simple habits can stop even the most polished scams before they get to your accounts.",

      "Why FoloToy restored Kumma's sales after its safety review",
      "FoloToy brought Kumma back to its online store just one week after suspending sales. The fast return drew attention from parents and safety experts who wondered if the company had enough time to fix the serious issues identified in PIRG's report.",
      "FoloToy posted a detailed statement on X that laid out its version of what happened. In the post, the company said it viewed child safety as its\u00a0\"highest priority\" and that it was\u00a0\"the only company to proactively suspend sales, not only of the product mentioned in the report, but also of our other AI toys.\" FoloToy said it took this action \"immediately after the findings were published because we believe responsible action must come before commercial considerations.\"",
      "The company also emphasized to CyberGuy that it was the only one of the three AI toy startups in the PIRG review to suspend sales across all of its products and that it made this decision during the peak Christmas sales season, knowing the commercial impact would be significant. FoloToy told us, \"Nevertheless, we moved forward decisively, because we believe that responsible action must always come before commercial interests.\"",
      "The company also said it took the report's disturbing examples seriously. According to FoloToy, the issues were \"directly addressed in our internal review.\" It explained that the team\u00a0\"initiated a deep, company-wide internal safety audit,\" then \"strengthened and upgraded our content-moderation and child-safety safeguards,\" and\u00a0\"deployed enhanced safety rules and protections through our cloud-based system.\"",
      "After outlining these steps, the company said it spent the week on\u00a0\"rigorous review, testing, and reinforcement of our safety modules.\" It concluded its announcement by saying it\u00a0\"began gradually restoring product sales\" as those updated safeguards went live.",
      "FoloToy added that as global attention on AI toy risks grows,\u00a0\"transparency, responsibility and continuous improvement are essential,\" and that the company\u00a0\"remains firmly committed to building safe, age-appropriate AI companions for children and families worldwide.\"",

      "PIRG researcher RJ Cross said her team plans to test the updated toys to see if the fixes hold up. She noted that a week feels fast for such significant changes, and only new tests will show if the product now behaves safely.",
      "Parents will want to follow this closely as AI-powered toys grow more common. The speed of FoloToy's relaunch raises questions about the depth of its review.",

      "AI toys can feel exciting and helpful, but they can also surprise you with content you'd never expect. If you plan to bring an AI-powered toy into your home, these simple steps can help you stay in control.",
      "Not every model follows the same guardrails. Some include stronger filters while others may respond too freely. Look for transparent disclosures about which model powers the toy and what safety features support it.",
      "Groups like PIRG often test toys in ways parents cannot. These reviews flag hidden risks and point out behavior you may not catch during quick demos.",
      "Keep AI toys in shared spaces where you can hear or see how your child interacts with it. This helps you step in if the toy gives a concerning answer.",
      "Ask the toy questions, try creative prompts and see how it handles tricky topics. This lets you learn how it behaves before you hand it to your child.",
      "Many AI toys run on cloud systems. Updates often add stronger safeguards or reduce risky answers. Make sure the device stays current.",
      "AI toys can gather voice data, location info or behavioral patterns. A strong privacy policy should explain what is collected, how long it is stored and who can access it.",

    "story": [
      "FOX Business correspondent Darren Botelho reports on growing concerns about the misuse of artificial intelligence after a major U.S. company, Anthropic, detected a cyberattack using AI by Chinese-sponsored hackers.",
      "Cybersecurity has been reshaped by the rapid rise of advanced artificial intelligence tools, and recent incidents show just how quickly the threat landscape is shifting.",
      "Over the past year, we've seen a surge in attacks powered by AI models that can write code, scan networks and automate complex tasks. This capability has helped defenders, but it has also enabled attackers to move faster than before.",
      "The latest example is a major cyberespionage campaign conducted by a Chinese state-linked group that used Anthropic's Claude to carry out large parts of an attack with very little human involvement.",
      "HACKER EXPLOITS AI CHATBOT IN CYBERCRIME SPREE",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report\u00a0Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "How Chinese hackers turned Claude into an automated attack machine",
      "In mid-September 2025, Anthropic investigators spotted unusual behavior that eventually revealed a coordinated and well-resourced campaign. The threat actor, assessed with high confidence as a Chinese state-sponsored group, had used Claude Code to target roughly 30 organizations worldwide. The list included major tech firms, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government bodies. A small number of those attempts resulted in successful breaches.",
      "Claude handled most of the operation autonomously, triggering thousands of requests and generating detailed documentation of the attack for future use. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "This was not a typical intrusion. The attackers built a framework that let Claude act as an autonomous operator. Instead of asking the model to help, they tasked it with executing most of the attack. Claude inspected systems, mapped out internal infrastructure and flagged databases worth targeting. The speed was unlike anything a human team could replicate.",
      "To get around Claude's safety rules, the attackers broke their plan into tiny, innocent-looking steps. They also told the model it was part of a legitimate cybersecurity team performing defensive testing. Anthropic later noted that the attackers didn't simply hand tasks to Claude; they engineered the operation to make the model believe it was performing authorized pentesting work, splitting the attack into harmless-looking pieces and using multiple jailbreak techniques to push past its safeguards. Once inside, Claude researched vulnerabilities, wrote custom exploits, harvested credentials and expanded access. It worked through these steps with little supervision and reported back only when it needed human approval for major decisions.",
      "The model also handled the data extraction. It collected sensitive information, sorted it by value and identified high-privilege accounts. It even created backdoors for future use. In the final stage, Claude generated detailed documentation of what it had done. This included stolen credentials, systems analyzed and notes that could guide future operations.",
      "Across the entire campaign, investigators estimate that Claude performed around 80-90% of the work. Human operators stepped in only a handful of times. At its peak, the AI triggered thousands of requests, often multiple per second, a pace still far beyond what any human team could achieve. Although it occasionally hallucinated credentials or misread public data as secret, those errors underscored that fully autonomous cyberattacks still face limitations, even when an AI model handles the majority of the work.",
      "Why this AI-powered Claude attack is a turning point for cybersecurity",
      "This campaign shows how much the barrier to high-end cyberattacks has dropped. A group with far fewer resources could now attempt something similar by leaning on an autonomous AI agent to do the heavy lifting. Tasks that once required years of expertise can now be automated by a model that understands context, writes code and uses external tools without direct oversight.",
      "Earlier incidents documented AI misuse, but humans were still steering every step. This case is different. The attackers needed very little involvement once the system was in motion. And while the investigation focused on usage within Claude, researchers believe similar activity is happening across other advanced models, which might include Google Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Musk's Grok.",
      "This raises a difficult question. If these systems can be misused so easily, why continue building them? According to researchers, the same capabilities that make AI dangerous are also what make it essential for defense. During this incident, Anthropic's own team used Claude to analyze the flood of logs, signals and data its investigation uncovered. That level of support will matter even more as threats grow.",
      "We reached out to Anthropic for comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",

      "You may not be the direct target of a state-sponsored campaign, but many of the same techniques trickle down to everyday scams, credential theft and account takeovers. Here are seven detailed steps you can take to stay safer.",
      "Strong antivirus software does more than scan for known malware. It looks for suspicious patterns, blocked connections and abnormal system behavior. This is important because AI-driven attacks can generate new code quickly, which means traditional signature-based detection is no longer enough.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com",
      "A good password manager helps you create long, random passwords for every service you use. This matters because AI can generate and test password variations at high speed. Using the same password across accounts can turn a single leak into a full compromise.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "A large part of modern cyberattacks begins with publicly available information. Attackers often gather email addresses, phone numbers, old passwords and personal details from data broker sites. AI tools make this even easier, since they can scrape and analyze huge datasets in seconds. A personal data removal service helps clear your information from these broker sites so you are harder to profile or target.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Strong passwords alone are not enough when attackers can steal credentials through malware, phishing pages or automated scripts. Two-factor authentication adds a serious roadblock. Use app-based codes or hardware keys instead of SMS. While no method is perfect, this extra layer often stops unauthorized logins even when attackers have your password.",
      "Attackers rely heavily on known vulnerabilities that people forget or ignore. System updates patch these flaws and close off entry points that attackers use to break in. Enable automatic updates on your phone, laptop, router and the apps you use most. If an update looks optional, treat it as important anyway, because many companies downplay security fixes in their release notes.",
      "Malicious apps are one of the easiest ways attackers get inside your device. Stick to official app stores and avoid APK sites, shady download portals and random links shared on messaging apps. Even on official stores, check reviews, download counts and the developer name before installing anything. Grant the minimum permissions required and avoid apps that ask for full access for no clear reason.",
      "AI tools have made phishing more convincing. Attackers can generate clean messages, imitate writing styles and craft perfect fake websites that match the real ones. Slow down when a message feels urgent or unexpected. Never click links from unknown senders, and verify requests from known contacts through a separate channel. If a pop-up claims your device is infected or your bank account is locked, close it and check directly through the official website.",
      "By breaking tasks into small, harmless-looking steps, the threat actors tricked Claude into writing exploits, harvesting credentials and expanding access.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The attack carried out through Claude signals a major shift in how cyber threats will evolve. Autonomous AI agents can already perform complex tasks at speeds no human team can match, and this gap will only widen as models improve. Security teams now need to treat AI as a core part of their defensive toolkit, not a future add-on. Better threat detection, stronger safeguards and more sharing across the industry are going to be crucial. Because if attackers are already using AI at this scale, the window to prepare is shrinking fast.",

      "Lai Ching-te, president of Taiwan, viewed tank drills using U.S.-made equipment, Thursday, July 10, 2025. (Associated Press)",
      "KAOHSIUNG: Last week, Taiwan President William Lai unveiled a massive $40 billion supplemental defense procurement proposal, casting it as proof that the independently ruled, democratic island is serious about countering escalating military pressure from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The PRC has not governed Taiwan for even a single day but claims it as its territory.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital that, \"We welcome Taiwan\u2019s announcement of a new $40 billion special defense procurement budget. Consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and more than 45 years of commitment across multiple U.S. Administrations, the United States supports Taiwan\u2019s acquisition of critical defense capabilities, commensurate with the threat it faces.\"",
      "The spokesperson also commended Taipei, saying, \"We also welcome the Lai administration\u2019s recent commitments to increase defense spending to at least 3% of GDP by 2026 and 5% of GDP by 2030, which demonstrates resolve to strengthen Taiwan\u2019s self-defense capabilities.\"",

      "The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) \u2013 the de facto American embassy \u2013 responded very positively almost immediately after Lai\u2019s proposal was announced. Courtney Donovan Smith, a political columnist for the Taipei Times, told Fox News Digital that the strong support from AIT, \"Amounts to a public American stamp of approval.\"",
      "A day after Lai\u2019s announcement, Taiwan Defense Minister Wellington Koo told the media that preliminary talks have already been held with the United States about the kinds of weapons it wants to buy as part of this budget that would run from 2026 to 2033. But Koo said he could not make any details of discussions public until Congress receives a formal notification.",
      "Yet some in Taiwan expressed concern that the language from the administration was somewhat understated, and didn\u2019t come from senior-enough officials.",
      "Those worried about what they perceive as a muted tone from the Trump administration wondered if the timing could be sensitive, coming shortly after President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed to a trade deal, and just days after Xi phoned Trump to reiterate Beijing\u2019s claims over Taiwan, claims the U.S. \"acknowledges\" but does not accept.",
      "Even so, Taipei-based political risk analyst and Tamkang University assistant professor Ross Feingold told Fox News Digital that U.S. support fundamentally has not shifted and that when it comes to U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan, \"If Taiwan is a willing buyer, the Trump administration is likely to be a willing seller.\"",

      "Also causing distress to the fragile egos of China\u2019s communist leaders is Japan\u2019s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a conservative who became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister in October. She appeared to break long-standing Japanese strategic ambiguity over Taiwan when, asked on Nov. 7 in parliament whether a Chinese attack on Taiwan would qualify as \"a situation threatening Japan\u2019s survival.\"",
      "Takaichi didn\u2019t deflect with a \"I don\u2019t comment on hypotheticals.\" Instead, she said, \"If there are battleships and the use of force, no matter how you think about it, it could constitute a survival-threatening situation.\"",

      "China predictably lashed out, immediately calling her remarks \"egregious.\" A Chinese diplomat in Osaka escalated further, reposting coverage on X with a threat-like warning: \"The dirty head that sticks itself in must be cut off.\"",
      "Kerry K. Gershaneck, a visiting scholar at National Chengchi University and a former U.S. Marine counterintelligence officer, told Fox News Digital that the U.S. needed to clearly denounce China for threats against Japan and the Japanese prime minister. Gershaneck warned that Asian allies remember past U.S. abandonment under what he called the \"do not provoke China!\" policy of the Obama administration. \"Unless high-level Washington officials signal stronger support,\" he said, \"the Trump 47 administration risks going down in history as Barack Hussein Obama\u2019s third term.\"",
      "Feingold noted that while Takaichi\u2019s stance was enthusiastically received in Taiwan, the excitement \"was unsustainable and not based on a formal policy decision by Japan to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "Following reports that President Trump phoned the Japanese prime minister and requested that she dial down talk about Taiwan, Japan\u2019s Chief Cabinet Secretary Kihara Minoru issued a strong denial, saying Trump did not advise Takaichi to \"temper the tone of her comments about Taiwan.\"",

      "While the geopolitical shifts grabbed headlines, Lai\u2019s real challenge is domestic. Taiwan has a single-chamber legislature, and Lai\u2019s Democratic Progressive Party does not have a majority.",
      "Cheng Li-wun, the new chair of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), campaigned against boosting defense spending to 5% of GDP and has repeatedly argued Taiwan is \"not an ATM\" for \"unreasonable\" military budgets. The KMT supports renewed engagement with Beijing and acceptance of the \"1992 Consensus,\" a proposed framework that allows both sides to claim there is \"one China\" while interpreting the meaning differently. Lai rejects that position entirely, calling it a path toward subordination to China.",

      "Bryce Barros, associate fellow at GLOBSEC and a former U.S. Senate national security advisor, told Fox News Digital that there are serious hurdles. \"Opposition leaders have cited cuts to other essential services like healthcare, lack of details on how the budget will be paid for and concerns over more hostilities with China,\" he said. But Barros said the head of the de facto American embassy has called for bipartisan support for the bill, and he noted Lai needs only six opposition defections for the vote to pass.",
      "Analysts also stress the proposal is not solely for U.S. weapons. Lai wants major investment in domestic defense manufacturing, including a \"dome\" anti-missile system, which could help blunt accusations of excessive spending to curry favor with Washington. But the plan still faces a volatile parliament and certain retaliation from China.",

      "Leo received a raucous, ululating welcome from the crowds and a sincere welcome from its spiritual leaders on his first full day in Lebanon, where billboards with his image dotted highways around the capital. Thousands of ordinary Lebanese braved a steady rain in the morning to line his motorcade route, some throwing flower petals and rice on his car in a gesture of welcome.",
      "History\u2019s first American pope is on his maiden papal voyage, and it has taken him to the heart of Christianity: First to Turkey to commemorate a founding profession of the Christian faith and now to Lebanon to encourage an ancient Christian community in a country that is unique in the Arab world for its religious tolerance.",
      "The highlight of his day was an interfaith meeting in Martyr\u2019s Square in Beirut, with the country\u2019s Christian patriarchs and Sunni, Shiite and Druze spiritual leaders gathered under a tent.

      "Leo\u2019s remarks underscored the vital importance of Lebanon and its Christian community to the Catholic Church, a place that St. John Paul II famously said was more than just a country, but a message of freedom to the rest of the world. At the end of the event, the spiritual leaders planted an olive sapling as a symbol of peace.",

      "More recently, Lebanon has been deeply divided over calls for Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party, to disarm after fighting a war with Israel last year that left the country deeply damaged. Despite a ceasefire, Israel has carried out almost daily airstrikes targeting Hezbollah members.",
      "The Grand Sunni Muslim Mufti of Lebanon, Abdul-Latif Derian, welcomed Leo at the interfaith event and recalled the good relations forged by his predecessor, Pope Francis.

Leo\u2019s response, \"Well, we\u2019re going,\" had cheered Lebanese who were otherwise offended by the suggestion that Lebanon wasn\u2019t safe for the pope to visit.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed Texas to use a new congressional district map in next year\u2019s midterm elections that was drawn to maximize Republican political power.",
      "Granting an emergency application filed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the conservative majority paused a lower court ruling that said the map was unlawful because Republican lawmakers, at the direction of the Trump administration, explicitly considered race when drawing new districts.",
      "The unsigned order said that Texas is \u201clikely to succeed on the merits of its claim,\u201d including that the lower court \u201cfailed to honor the presumption of legislative good faith\u201d when assessing the state Legislature\u2019s motives.",
      "The ruling appeared to be 6-3, with the three liberal justices dissenting.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan wrote in dissent that the decision \u201cdisrespects the work of a district court that did everything one could ask\u201d and also \u201cdisserves the millions of Texans whom the district court found were assigned to their new districts based on their race.\u201d",
      "The map was drawn with the aim of adding up to five additional Republican House seats, which no one contests, but the lower court found that the map was drawn with the aim of moving certain minority voters into different districts.",
      "In a separate concurring opinion pushing back on Kagan, conservative Justice Samuel Alito said that the plaintiffs challenging the map needed to do a better job of showing that race was the motivating factor by, among other things, producing their own map that would show the state\u2019s partisan goals could be achieved by other means.",
      "The failure to do so gave rise to \u201ca strong inference that the state\u2019s map was indeed based on partisanship, not race,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The decision marks a win for President Donald Trump, who filed a brief urging the court to rule in favor of Texas.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who defended the map, welcomed the decision.",
      "\u201cThis map reflects the political climate of our state and is a massive win for Texas and every conservative who is tired of watching the left try to upend the political system with bogus lawsuits,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "The Supreme Court had provisionally put the decision on hold on Nov. 21 while the justices weighed what next step to take, in an order signed by Alito.",
      "Traditionally, states draw new districts once a decade after the census shows how populations have shifted. But this year, Trump, worried about the narrow Republican majority in the House, has repeatedly pushed Republican-led states to draw new maps outside of the normal timeline.",
      "A Trump administration letter earlier this year said the state could be subject to a federal lawsuit if it did not eliminate \u201ccoalition districts\u201d in which nonwhite voters of different races constitute the majority.",
      "Thanks to a Supreme Court ruling in 2019, states are free to redistrict in a way intended to maximize the majority party\u2019s political power, but there remain some restrictions under both the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act when race is a factor.",
      "Democrats responded to the Texas plan by launching an effort to draw a new congressional map in California to counteract the potential Republican gains. Litigation in that case could also reach the Supreme Court.",
      "In the Texas case, the three-judge lower court invalidated the new map on a 2-1 vote, with the majority opinion authored by Judge Jeffrey Brown, a Trump appointee.",
      "While politics played a role in the maps being redrawn, there was \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that it was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment, he wrote.",
      "In asking the Supreme Court to block the lower court ruling, Texas\u2019 lawyers argued in part that it was too late in the election cycle for federal judges to intervene. The lawyers also said that the new map was clearly designed for partisan gain and denied that there was any racial motive.",
      "\u201cThis summer, the Texas legislature did what legislatures do: politics,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by six groups of plaintiffs, including the League of United Latin American Citizens, or LULAC, the Texas NAACP and two members of Congress, Texas Democratic Reps. Al Green and Jasmine Crockett.",
      "In a court filing, one group of challengers said that \u201cthe entire thrust of the governor\u2019s justification for authorizing redistricting\u201d was to remove and replace the coalition districts, meaning that race and not partisan politics was the motive."

      "The Justice Department on Thursday failed to secure an indictment against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "The presentation to the grand jury came less than two weeks after the original criminal case against her was dismissed.",
      "James, a frequent political target of President Donald Trump\u2019s who had successfully brought a fraud lawsuit against him, had previously been indicted by a grand jury on one charge of bank fraud and another of making false statements to a financial institution.",
      "James has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and a former personal attorney to Trump with no prior prosecutorial experience, presented the case to a grand jury on her own in the first go-round \u2014 and that case was declared void on Nov. 24 when a judge found Halligan\u2019s appointment was unlawful.",
      "The Justice Department initially vowed to appeal the ruling by U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie, but ultimately decided to seek a new, untainted indictment against James, a source familiar with the deliberations told NBC News earlier this week.",
      "The new case was presented to a grand jury in Norfolk, Virginia, by different prosecutors.",
      "The failure to secure an indictment on Thursday does not bar prosecutors from attempting to do so again in the future.",
      "A separate source familiar with the matter said there \u201cshould be no premature celebrations.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department does not comment on grand jury matters.",
      "Prosecutors have also been discussing trying to again bring a case against former FBI Director James Comey, who was indicted in October on charges of making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation.",
      "Currie dismissed the case against him on the same day she tossed the case against James on the same grounds.",
      "Trump named Halligan U.S. attorney for the Eastern District on Sept. 20, the day after he forced out his initial pick, Erik Siebert, who resisted pressure to prosecute Comey and James.",
      "The Halligan appointment also came after Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi in a social media post to push ahead with prosecutions of Comey, James and another perceived political adversary, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "\u201cPam: I have reviewed over 30 statements and posts saying that, essentially, \u2018same old story as last time, all talk, no action. Nothing is being done. What about Comey, Adam \u2018Shifty\u2019 Schiff, Leticia??? They\u2019re all guilty as hell, but nothing is going to be done,\u2019\u201d Trump said the post, which a source previously confirmed to NBC News the president had intended as a direct message to Bondi, not a public post.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t delay any longer, it\u2019s killing our reputation and credibility,\u201d Trump continued, while praising Halligan as \u201ca really good lawyer.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance, reflecting Thursday on his first year in office, said that he disagrees with fellow Republicans who have warned of a rise in antisemitism in their party.\u201cJudging anybody based on their skin color or immutable characteristics, I think, is fundamentally anti-American and anti-Christian,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance, reflecting Thursday on his first year in office, said that he disagrees with fellow Republicans who have warned of a rise in antisemitism in their party.",
      "\u201cJudging anybody based on their skin color or immutable characteristics, I think, is fundamentally anti-American and anti-Christian,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cI do think it\u2019s important to call this stuff out when I see it. I also, when I talk to young conservatives, I don\u2019t see some simmering antisemitism that\u2019s exploding.\u201d",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has positioned himself as a potential Vance rival in the 2028 presidential race, raising his profile in part by condemning what he sees as an escalation of anti-Israel and anti-Jewish sentiment. Cruz has singled out young conservatives who pressed Vance with questions about Israel at a recent political event, while also criticizing Tucker Carlson, a Vance ally who hosted a Holocaust denier on his podcast.",
      "\u201cDo I think that the Republican Party is substantially more antisemitic than it was 10 or 15 years ago? Absolutely not,\u201d Vance said. \u201cIn any bunch of apples, you have bad people. But my attitude on this is we should be firm in saying antisemitism and racism is wrong. ... I think it\u2019s kind of slanderous to say that the Republican Party, the conservative movement, is extremely antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Vance offered the comments \u2014 his first on the subject since Cruz began raising it \u2014 during an interview inside his West Wing office, wading into an issue that has roiled his party in recent weeks amid a broader focus on antisemitism by the Trump administration.",
      "Sipping from a cup of coffee while a fireplace crackled behind him, he also volunteered the names of three progressives he said he has come to appreciate, for various reasons: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.",
      "And the vice president talked about what he views as key areas of progress and disappointment since he and President Donald Trump were inaugurated in January, including recognizing that voters are \u201cimpatient\u201d to see more progress on prices and the economy. Increased deportations and the sharp decline in illegal border crossings, Vance said, stand among the administration\u2019s early victories.",
      "\u201cI think Kristi\u2019s done a good job. I think Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, all these people have done a very good job,\u201d said Vance, referring to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other officials involved in U.S. border and immigration policy. \u201cThat\u2019s where you see the clearest numbers and the most immediate return on all of our time and all of our hard work, and so that\u2019s what I\u2019m proudest of.\u201d",
      "Vance, who has played a role in Middle East diplomacy and efforts to negotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, said he feels he was most effective this year in helping Trump get his signature \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d through Congress. Vance helped whip support for the legislation and cast the tie-breaking vote to clinch passage of the tax and spending bill in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI spent hours at the Capitol with a bunch of United States senators, late into the night on the first vote, and I frankly didn\u2019t know whether we were going to be able to get it passed, and we did,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd we did because the president was making phone calls, and we did because I was there encouraging people to vote the right way. That\u2019s probably where I see the most tangible connection between the hard work that I did and a good outcome for the American people.\u201d",
      "Asked about his biggest frustration so far as vice president, Vance cited the failure so far to broker a deal to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "\u201cOh, man. I mean, look, the Russia-Ukraine thing has been a source of perennial frustration, I think, for the entire White House,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI think that we really thought \u2014 and you\u2019ve heard the president say this a million times \u2014 that that would be the easiest war to solve. And if you would put, you know, peace in the Middle East as easier to achieve than peace in Eastern Europe, I would have told you you were crazy.\u201d",
      "Vance added that he remained optimistic.",
      "\u201cI do think, for what it\u2019s worth, that we have made a lot of progress, but we\u2019re not yet quite across the finish line there,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s hope \u2014 should hopefully be some good news the next few weeks on that front.\u201d",
      "The vice president also expressed frustration that prices have not come down as fast as he and Trump promised on the campaign trail last year, while deflecting the blame onto former President Joe Biden. He cited several metrics, including a four-month drop in rent, as signs of better days to come. Trump, meanwhile, has chosen a different message, arguing in recent days that Americans\u2019 affordability concerns are part of a \u201cfake narrative.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the president certainly understands that prices got way too high,\u201d Vance said when asked about Trump\u2019s remarks. \u201cBut I think what the president\u2019s saying is the idea that, 11 months into the administration, that we could solve all of the affordability problems created by Democrats \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the hoax. The hoax is the idea that it\u2019s our fault and not the Democrats\u2019 fault. And I do think that\u2019s a totally bulls--- narrative.\u201d",
      "Recent polls have shown Americans are unhappy with Trump\u2019s management of the economy. In an NBC News poll conducted in late October, 63% of registered voters, including 30% of Republicans, said they felt Trump had fallen short of their expectations on the economy.",
      "\u201cI think the voters will ultimately have to make that choice,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI certainly see some of the polling that you\u2019ve seen. But I think that the reason why we have elections every two years and not every year, at least for Congress, thank God, is you\u2019ve got to give a little bit of time for this stuff to work.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I would certainly say voters are impatient. I think voters have every right to be impatient,\u201d Vance continued. \u201cWe are impatient, too, and we\u2019re going to see if what we do and what we think we have to do converges with what the voters think we should be doing.\u201d",
      "Next year\u2019s midterm elections will help answer that question, Vance added.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll find that out in about a year,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re just going to keep on working as hard as we can until then.\u201d",
      "The midterms also are a key waypoint for Vance as he weighs a campaign to succeed the term-limited Trump in 2028.",
      "Vance has routinely sidestepped questions about his political future by saying \u201cthe politics will sort themselves out\u201d if he and Trump do a good job. He jokingly repeated that talking point when reminded of it Thursday and asked under what circumstances he would not seek the presidency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to find out a lot in the midterms and afterwards \u2014 what we got right, what we got wrong, what we could have done better on, what we did very well on,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to not wake up and ever think, \u2018What does this mean for my future?\u2019 I always try to think, \u2018How can I do a good job right now,\u2019 right? And that\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019ve tried to steer away from the 2028 conversation. \u2026 I never want the focus on the future to come at the expense of this job.\u201d",
      "Vance steered away again when pressed with the same question that haunted then-Vice President Kamala Harris while running for president last year. Vance and other Republicans ridiculed Harris when, during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d she said she could not think of anything she would have done differently than Biden. Vance at the time cast it as Harris whiffing on a \u201csoftball\u201d question, but he asserted Thursday that it was too soon to lob it at him.",
      "\u201cThe president really needs a vice president who is loyal to him and doesn\u2019t use the media to backstab or to set himself up well for 2028,\u201d Vance said. \u201cSo what you will never hear me do in this job is attack the president of the United States. Of course, if I run for another office in the future, it\u2019s going to be reasonable for people to ask me, \u2018Would you have done this thing? Would you have done that thing?\u2019 And if that time ever comes, let\u2019s have that conversation. But I am never going to attack the president of the United States.\u201d",
      "While Vance said there\u2019s no Democrat who greatly worries him as a potentially strong 2028 presidential contender, he singled out Sanders, Khanna and Mamdani.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been fascinated by Bernie,\u201d Vance said. \u201cI will one day tell you what Bernie said to me, like the second day that I was in the United States Senate. It\u2019s one of the funniest things that I\u2019ve ever heard, and it\u2019s actually a pretty good summary of my politics, but it would probably really hurt me on both the left and the right. If I told you what Bernie told me, it would probably hurt Bernie, too.\u201d",
      "Khanna, Vance noted, has sparred with him on social media. \u201cI think sometimes he\u2019s very annoying, but he also \u2014 he occasionally will say something interesting, which is more than I could say for most politicians,\u201d Vance said.",
      "And Vance described Mamdani, the democratic socialist mayor-elect who recently had a friendly Oval Office visit with Trump, as \u201cfascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, I\u2019m not a communist, and I think he is,\u201d Vance added, \u201cbut the fact that he focuses so aggressively on the affordability question in New York City, which does have one of the worst affordability crises anywhere in the world, is smart, and he\u2019s at least listening to people.",
      "He continued: \u201cMost politicians, it\u2019s a very low bar, but they don\u2019t even listen to people. I would put Mamdani, Bernie and Ro Khanna in the category of those who, at least sometimes, they are.\u201d"

    "summary": "The CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel once again delayed an expected vote on hepatitis B vaccines, after a chaotic meeting rife with misinformation.",
    "story": [
      "In a chaotic meeting Thursday rife with misinformation, the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory panel \u2014 whose members Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired in June and replaced with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines \u2014 once again delayed an expected vote on hepatitis B vaccines.",
      "Because of disagreements and confusion over the voting language, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's panel, formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, decided to push the vote to Friday morning instead of holding it Thursday afternoon as scheduled. The committee had previously tabled a September vote on the hepatitis B vaccine schedule.",
      "The meeting was, in numerous ways, a radical departure from past practices. Typically, the ACIP evaluates new vaccines or new indications for them, not shots that have been administered in the same way for decades.",
      "The CDC has for 34 years recommended that all newborns get a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth. But the panel is considering whether to roll back that guidance and instead suggest that women who test negative for hepatitis B decide in consultation with a health care provider whether their baby should get the dose at birth.",
      "If adopted, that recommendation would go against widespread consensus among public health experts, who before the meeting issued loud pleas not to change the hepatitis B vaccination schedule.",
      "On Thursday, the advisory panel convened in the CDC\u2019s broadcast studio, under bright lights and in front of large television cameras, instead of its typical conference room \u2014 giving the appearance of a televised show rather than a scientific discussion. When asked about the venue, Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said it was meant to \u201caccommodate increased public interest in the committee.\u201d",
      "The proceedings featured a barrage of misleading claims and cherry-picked data.",
      "Several presenters and panel members claimed there was limited evidence of the hepatitis B vaccine\u2019s safety or efficacy, ignoring decades of evidence to the contrary. At past meetings, the CDC\u2019s medical experts have presented data on the risks of a given disease and the safety and efficacy of vaccines that target it. But the presentations Thursday were instead given by two anti-vaccine activists and a climate scientist who has written for an anti-vaccine publication.",
      "\u201cUsually, your presenters are supposed to be sort of nonjudgmental and very scientific, and that\u2019s not the case today,\u201d said Chari Cohen, president of the nonprofit Hepatitis B Foundation.",
      "The meeting was the most blatant example to date of how far the panel has strayed from its original mission to consider who should get vaccines \u2014 and when \u2014 based on a complete scientific analysis of the risks and benefits.",
      "In a presentation on safety, anti-vaccine activist Mark Blaxill \u2014 a businessman and author with no medical credentials who was recently hired at the CDC \u2014 suggested that symptoms identified in babies who got the hepatitis B vaccine, such as fatigue, weakness, diarrhea or irritability were \u201cpossibly connected\u201d to swelling of the brain, or encephalitis.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, the only ACIP member who has previously served on the committee, pushed back: \u201cThat is absolutely not encephalitis,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a statement that a physician would make. They are not related to encephalitis, and you can\u2019t say that.\u201d",
      "By early afternoon, multiple members of the committee expressed confusion over what they were voting on and pointed to issues with the voting language.",
      "\u201cPerhaps this was written by the department of redundancy department,\u201d quipped ACIP member Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist.",
      "The panel\u2019s chair, Dr. Kirk Milhoan, was not present for the decision to postpone the hepatitis B vote. Vice chair Dr. Robert Malone said Milhoan was \u201cabout to jump on a plane to go to Asia and would not be available, I believe, for [the discussion] tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, commented during the meeting that the proceedings amounted to \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou are wasting taxpayer dollars by not having scientific, rigorous discussion on issues that truly matter,\u201d Goldman said. \u201cThe best thing you can do is adjourn the meeting and discuss vaccine issues that actually need to be taken up.\u201d",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said on X before the meeting began that the advisory panel is \u201ctotally discredited\u201d and \u201cnot protecting children.\u201d Cassidy, a liver doctor who treated patients with hepatitis B, chairs the Senate\u2019s health committee and cast a key vote in favor of confirming Kennedy as health secretary.",
      "Hepatitis B is an incurable infection that can lead to liver disease, cancer and death. The virus can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. So public health experts say that delaying the shots could lead to more infections.",
      "The prevailing medical consensus is that hepatitis B vaccines are overwhelmingly safe, based on decades of real-world data. A CDC analysis of children born from 1994 to 2023 estimated that hepatitis B vaccination prevented more than 6 million infections and nearly 1 million hospitalizations.",
      "In addition to its vote on hepatitis B vaccines Friday, the CDC advisory panel is also expected to discuss the entire childhood immunization schedule, as well as the presence of aluminum salts found in many childhood vaccines, which help boost the immune response and reduce the number of required doses.",
      "Both are hot-button topics among anti-vaccine activists, who often argue that children receive too many vaccines and that aluminum salts in them increases the risk of autoimmune conditions or neurodevelopmental disorders. Neither claim is supported by scientific evidence.",
      "Aaron Siri, an anti-vaccine lawyer who has represented Kennedy, is expected to give a presentation Friday. Siri has advocated for the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine. It was his presence on the ACIP agenda that provoked Cassidy\u2019s ire.",
      "In response to Cassidy\u2019s post on X, which singled Siri out, Siri fired back in his own post, challenging Cassidy to a long-form debate.",
      "Aria Bendix reported from New York City and Erika Edwards from CDC headquarters in Atlanta."

      "For the entertainment industry, Saudi financing has become more appealing as other sources of money have dried up in the aftermath of the 2020 Covid pandemic, the 2023 dual actors\u2019 and writers\u2019 strikes, and shifting audience habits away from film and TV to social media.",
      "\u201cMoney is good, that\u2019s Hollywood\u2019s perspective,\u201d said entertainment attorney Schuylar (Sky) Moore at Greenberg Glusker. \u201cFor the Saudis, it\u2019s all about building their own film industry, and they\u2019re trying to get the expertise and the people there.\u201d",
      "But Saudi Arabia\u2019s controversial human rights record makes the relationship an uneasy one for some in the West \u2014 and a sensitive topic to talk about in Hollywood, where more than a dozen insiders including agents, producers, executives, bankers and publicists declined to go on the record about the inrush of potential Saudi cash.",

      "A spokesperson for the Red Sea Film Festival contested the figure, calling it \u201cinaccurate, and not representative.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe festival does not disclose the details of any of its commercial arrangements, but we on occasion engage with talent on a contractual basis for work we ask them to do at the festival which includes labs, in conversations, mentorship sessions with emerging regional talent,\u201d the festival said in a statement. \u201cThe Foundation is first and foremost committed to nurturing talent in underrepresented markets \u2014 as evidenced by our programme and the filmmakers we support year round.\u201d",
      "This year, festival organizers announced that the nine-day event will feature a jury with Oscar-winning \u201cAnora\u201d director Sean Baker and actor Riz Ahmed; stage conversations with actors including Ana de Armas, Dakota Johnson, Kirsten Dunst, Jessica Alba and Adrien Brody; and tributes to actors Sigourney Weaver and Michael Caine. Many of the stars are being touted on the festival\u2019s official Instagram page. A diverse slate of films is set to screen including \u201cCouture\u201d starring Angelina Jolie, Paramount\u2019s \u201cThe Spongebob Movie: Search for Squarepants,\u201d and Jordan\u2019s Oscar submission, \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d which received financial support from the Red Sea Foundation.",
      "Saudi money is also behind a portion of Paramount Skydance\u2019s more than $60 billion bid this week for Warner Bros Discovery, according to Variety, which cites multiple sources, and Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the discussions. A spokesperson for Paramount declined to comment.",
      "Additionally, the kingdom is backing a $1 billion new independent content studio called Arena SNK launched in October by former Lionsgate executive Erik Feig, and a $55 billion deal for video game maker Electronic Arts announced in September. A representative for Feig declined to comment.",
      "Executives from Sony traveled to Saudi Arabia this fall for meetings, a spokesperson confirmed. Comcast CEO Brian Roberts also traveled to the country this fall to attend a conference and view a potential theme park site in Qiddiya, a tourism megaproject in Riyadh province, according to a source with knowledge of Roberts\u2019 trip who was not authorized to speak on the record about it. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, which is the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "While there are many deals in discussion, Moore noted that a major Hollywood studio has yet to actually close one with Saudi financing. If they do, the entertainment attorney said he suspects the deal will be contingent upon shooting in the region, to help build up the kingdom\u2019s local production infrastructure.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s not alone in its attempts to muster up funding from the Middle East \u2014 both the sports and gaming worlds have tapped into Saudi money. Critics, including Human Rights Watch, an international nongovernmental organization, and the Atlantic Council, a research institute, have accused the Saudi government of so-called \u201csportswashing,\u201d investing in golf and soccer to improve its international image.",
      "In 2027, WrestleMania will be held in Riyadh, marking the first time the WWE will hold its signature pay-per-view match outside North America. In a statement announcing the deal in September,Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque, WWE\u2019s chief content officer, said that the General Entertainment Authority (GEA) in Saudi Arabia and its chairman, Turki Alalshikh, \u201chave made a massive impact on the world of sports and entertainment.\u201d He described them as \u201cphenomenal partners to WWE.\u201d",
      "Video gaming giant Electronic Arts announced in September that it will be acquired for $55 billion in an all-cash deal by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners (the investment company run by Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner).",
      "From the Saudi perspective, the entertainment industry spending is a way to reduce the country\u2019s economic dependence on oil and to improve their image globally, which is all part of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s modernization plan for the kingdom called Vision 2030.",
      "In September, the Saudi Film Fund rebranded as Riviera Content, with a mandate to finance and produce movies with major global studios, bolstered by a 40% tax incentive for production in the kingdom.",
      "\u201cA lot of it is driven by a feeling in Saudi that their story isn\u2019t being told well,\u201d said one entertainment industry dealmaker who has done business in Saudi Arabia, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.",
      "In 2018, the Saudi/Hollywood collaboration was just beginning to get underway when, according to U.S. intelligence services, Crown Prince Mohammed approved an operation to assassinate Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of his government.",
      "In the months before the murder, the crown prince had ended a 35-year ban on movie theaters and traveled to Los Angeles to meet with News Corp. mogul Rupert Murdoch and Disney CEO Bob Iger. The Saudi Film Council had delivered a splashy pitch at the Cannes Film Festival, handing out guides to Saudi film locations and a book with data on the young, digitally savvy Saudi audience.",
      "The Khashoggi murder chilled the nascent cultural relationship and led Endeavor Content, the film and TV company behind shows like \u201cSeverance\u201d and \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d to back out of  a $400 million deal with the Saudi government in 2019.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s difficult financial environment and the reelection of President Donald Trump, who has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia, have reopened the door to conversations.",
      "In November, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison attended a White House dinner for Crown Prince Mohammed, the Saudi leader\u2019s first visit to the White House since the Khashoggi murder.",
      "For Western talent, however, the Saudi money still brings deeper questions.",
      "In September, American comedians like Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart and Pete Davidson faced backlash from fans, human rights activists and fellow comics for performing at the Riyadh Comedy Festival.",
      "Human Rights Watch accused the Saudi government of using the event \u201cto deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations.\u201d",
      "In October, late night host Jimmy Kimmel pressed comedian Aziz Ansari about his decision to perform at the festival.",
      "\u201cPeople, a lot of comedians especially, are very upset, because the people who paid the comedians to come to this are not good people,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty brutal regime. They\u2019ve done a lot of horrible, horrible things.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s people over there that don\u2019t agree with the stuff that the government\u2019s doing, and to ascribe like the worst behavior of the government onto those people, that\u2019s not fair,\u201d Ansari said of his decision, noting he asked his aunt who used to live in Saudi Arabia. \u201cJust like there\u2019s people in America that don\u2019t agree with the things the government is doing.\u201d",
      "The talent that is expected to attend the Red Sea Film Festival in the coming days have not publicly commented on their upcoming plans.",
      "Despite the stars in the lineup, many of the actors with films screening at Red Sea this year have declined to attend.",
      "That includes Jolie, whose representative did not say why she\u2019s skipping the event, and Pierce Brosnan and Jude Law, whose representatives both cited scheduling issues."

    "story": [
      "Michael Jordan is scheduled to testify Friday in a federal antitrust trial against NASCAR, two people close to the NBA Hall of Famer told NBC News.",
      "The suit, first filed in 2024, has played out in a Charlotte, North Carolina, courtroom since Monday as the Jordan-co-owned 23XI Racing team, along with Front Row Motorsports, seeks to prove its allegations that the stock car circuit is a monopoly that limits individual teams\u2019 revenues and freedom \u2014 including requiring all teams to use the same model of car and parts from NASCAR-approved suppliers \u2014 by stifling competition.",
      "NASCAR has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. In October, its commissioner said it was \"trying our hardest\" to settle the suit, whose discovery has exposed NASCAR's finances and internal communications. NASCAR was founded in 1948 by Bill France Sr., and the company\u2019s ownership and top leadership remain in the family.",
      "Though best-known for his basketball stardom and once owning the NBA's Charlotte Hornets, Jordan, 62, is also deeply involved in motorsports, and five years ago co-founded 23XI Racing along with a business partner, Curtis Polk, and longtime NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin.",
      "Jordan is expected to testify Friday, although court schedules can change.",
      "Since 2016, NASCAR has operated on a charter system that guarantees 36 teams entry into every race in its top series and shares of revenue. Teams have sought to make charters permanent and to increase the value that comes with owning them. In 2024, NASCAR offered charter-holding racing teams a model for sharing revenues, and while many teams signed the agreement, Jordan's team and Front Row Motorsports did not. They sued shortly thereafter.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t sign because I knew this was my death certificate for the future,\u201d Hamlin testified this week. \"I have spent 20 years trying to make this sport grow as a driver and for the last five years as a team owner. 23XI is doing our part. You can\u2019t have someone treat you this unfairly, and I knew it wasn\u2019t right. They were wrong, and someone needed to be held accountable.\"",
      "In its lawsuit, 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports called NASCAR \"monopolistic bullies\" and also took issue with NASCAR's ownership of the majority of the tracks used in the circuit, as well as the approvals non-NASCAR-owned tracks must earn to host its races.",
      "Jordan has said he elected to take on NASCAR \"for the smaller teams, as well; it's not just for me.\""

      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing two people lean in with empathy and engagement with each other,\u201d she explains.",
      "So, she says a relationship in which two people don\u2019t argue could have two different types of dynamic: One that is healthy and one that isn\u2019t.",
      "The unhealthy dynamic is conflict avoidance, she says. \u201cWe see this when we have certain insecure attachment styles that pair up together, that are both afraid of conflict. Instead of actually bringing up their needs or bringing up what feels bad to them or what they would like to see changed in the relationship, they just stay silent and shut it down,\u201d she says.",
      "She cautions that this could cause one person to harbor resentment, leading to other problems in the future. If both partners are conflict avoidant, then they are never really working through their issues.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re simply avoiding the hard discussions because they\u2019re afraid of being vulnerable, or maybe they\u2019re afraid of being rejected or that their partner is going to get triggered and have a poor response to their needs,\u201d Hensley adds.",
      "Although there can be a multitude of reasons for being conflict avoidant, the expert says that she sees that type of behavior often with insecurely attached people.",
      "Alternatively, she says two securely attached people could work through disagreements without arguing or becoming emotionally dysregulated. Instead, the two could react with respect and empathy for each other.",
      "\"I think the healthiest types of responses are ones in which we can stay calm and respectful, but if we do have some arguing, where people do get a little bit heated, as long as there\u2019s proper repair, the relationship can still stay relatively healthy, and we can still build more trust and safety over time,\" she says.",
      "As for George Clooney mentioning his age as one of the reasons he doesn\u2019t argue with his wife, Hensley says she has seen that trend in older couples, especially those who have been together for a long time.",
      "\u201cAs people age, a lot of times, if they\u2019re very self aware, they will have done the inner work to get to a place where they\u2019re not very argumentative inside of their relationship. That\u2019s different than conflict avoidance,\u201d she says.",
      "If couples are struggling with conflict avoidance, Hensley suggests focusing on nervous system work and somatic processing to become comfortable with their emotions.",
      "\u201cBeing able to focus on learning healthy emotional processing will allow you to feel more comfortable with other people\u2019s emotions, and it\u2019s not going to feel like receiving somebody else\u2019s emotions is automatically a criticism or something to be upset or dysregulated about,\u201d she advises.",
      "Hensley emphasizes the importance of being aware of your attachment style and not assuming incompatibility is the reason a relationship fails.",
      "\u201cWorking on your attachment and the things that come with insecure attachment, like your comfort with being vulnerable, your ability to process your emotions and your ability to stay objective is really important. But a lot of people just don\u2019t know what they don\u2019t know,\u201d she says.",
      "If a partner\u2019s blueprint is dysfunctional, then their relationships will be negatively impacted.",
      "\u201cInvestigate attachment and focus on your own attachment security,\u201d she encourages. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be the best way to have a healthy relationship in the future.\u201d"

      "\u201cSince the series\u2019 debut in 2014, the character of Abigail Stanton was a fan favorite and beloved by the Hearties,\u201d Michelle Vicary, the head of programming at Hallmark Channel, said in a statement. \u201cAt its core the Hallmark brand is about hope, positivity and connection, which is also the central theme of \u2018When Calls the Heart.\u2019 We felt that Season 14 was the right time to continue Abigail\u2019s story with her return to this beloved series.\u201d",
      "Season 13 of \u201cWhen Calls the Heart\u201d premieres on Jan. 4, 2026. Loughlin is set to appear in Season 14, which will air in 2027.",
      "Erin Krakow, who has starred in \"When Calls the Heart\" since the show's inception in 2014, shared her reaction on Instagram to Loughlin rejoining the cast. She also shared photos of her with Loughlin from over the years.",
      "\u201cThe very best news: Abigail\u2019s returning to @wcth_tv and Season 14 has been greenlit!\u201d she wrote. \u201cTears of joy (not hormones, I think)!\u201d",
      "Loughlin\u2019s character had been written off the show following the scandal, and her last episode aired in March 2019. She had also appeared in numerous Hallmark movies and the series \u201cGarage Sale Mysteries,\u201d all of which were pulled from the air.",
      "All of her projects have since returned to the Hallmark Channel and the Hallmark+ streaming service, a spokesperson confirmed to NBC News.",
      "The spokesperson said the network does \u201cnot have any additional news to share at this time\u201d as far as whether Loughlin will return to any other Hallmark movies or shows.",
      "While this marks the return of her character to \"When Calls the Heart,\" she actually played Stanton in 2021 in her first acting job since her release from prison.",
      "\u200bLoughlin appeared as Stanton on the second season of the spin-off series \u201cWhen Hope Calls\u201d on Great American Family in 2021. She followed that with a role in the romantic comedy \u201cFall Into Winter\u201d on the same network in 2023.",
      "She has since appeared in a 2024 episode of \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and starred in the Prime Video series \u201cOn Call,\u201d among other minor roles.",
      "The actor spoke with the publication First for Women in 2024 about \u201cpersevering\u201d through challenges without directly mentioning the admissions scandal.",
      "\u201cMy advice is to just keep moving forward. Everyone has good times and bad times,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s life. I think you just have to pick yourself up. Nobody said life was going to be a breeze. There\u2019s beauty in life, but there\u2019s also hardship in life.\u201d",
      "\u201cStuff happens to everyone,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been in positions to ask for forgiveness but to ask for it, you have to learn and know how to give forgiveness, too.\u201d",
      "In October, she and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, who served a five-month prison sentence for his role in the admissions scandal, separated after nearly 28 years of marriage."

      "Sabrina Carpenter is revealing exactly what she wanted her controversial \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d album cover to convey.",
      "The \u201cTears\u201d singer, 26, came under fire in June when she teased the album's cover photo ahead of its Aug. 29 release. The image, which shows Carpenter on her hands and knees as a man standing behind her grabs a fistful of her hair, was blasted as degrading to women.",
      "Carpenter released a second image at the time of a dog wearing a tag with the words \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend\u201d inscribed on it.",
      "In a new interview with Variety, Carpenter, who was named the publication\u2019s Hitmaker of the Year, said the album cover, to her, explored the duality of control and shared how she personally relates to that theme.",
      "\u201cYou can be so in control and so not in control at the same time,\" the singer explained.",
      "\u201cIt was about how people try to control women, and how I felt emotionally yanked around by these relationships that I had, and how much power you\u2019re allowing yourself to give them,\u201d she added.",
      "Carpenter said she looked at the uproar around the image as simply a difference of opinion.",
      "\u201cIt meant one thing to me and 100 things to other people, and I was looking at it going, \u2018That\u2019s valid. Mine\u2019s valid. What\u2019s for dinner?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cNot to bypass the weight that it did carry for some people. I saw it and was like, \u2018That is a great point. It wasn\u2019t the point I was trying to make.\u2019\u201d",
      "As the backlash to her provocative album cover raged, Carpenter released a second version of \"Man's Best Friend\" featuring an alternative cover.",
      "That cover featured a black-and-white photo of Carpenter slow dancing with a man in a suit, a callback to a classic shot of screen legend Marilyn Monroe and her third husband, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "Carpenter cheekily assured naysayers the new cover was \"approved by God\" when she announced it June 25 on Instagram.",
      "During the interview with Variety, Carpenter denied the alternative cover was a concession to her critics. \u201cOh, girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wanted to take more pictures!\u201d",
      "\"The (original cover) really says it all,\" she added, \"even though it\u2019s maybe not what you want me to say.\"",
      "In September, Carpenter told NPR she was \"surprised\" by the controversy sparked by her original cover.",
      "\"I think mostly because when I thought about making this album cover, I was really inspired by a man sort of delicately playing with my hair,\" she said. \"Because I think there were a lot of metaphors between this dog and me emotionally. You know, a man\u2019s best friend and sort of all the implications that that comes with it, the power in dominance and submission.",
      "\"When I saw it, obviously for me, it checked all the boxes in between my friends and family,\" she added at the time. \"It just felt like what the music sounds like.\""

      "After four years of dating, the couple recently got engaged, as confirmed by The New York Times.",

      "Jacquie Aiche designed the ring, TODAY.com can confirm.",
      "The ring appears to feature a cushion-cut diamond between four and five carats, according to jewelry experts TODAY.com interviewed.",
      "Laura Taylor, a jeweler specializing in engagement and wedding rings at Lorel Diamonds, says cushion-cut diamonds have a \u201cromantic, vintage feel\u201d and are known for \u201csoft corners and broad facets that catch the light with flashes rather than sparkle.\u201d",
      "It's set in a chunky gold design, which Taylor says has been \"making a return\" among celebrities \u2013\u00a0see: Dua Lipa's recent engagement ring.",
      "The diamond is surrounded by gold, rather than set in prongs, also known as a bezel-style setting.",
      "\"Not only does this keep the stone more secure, but it also helps it stand out even more,\u201d Taylor notes.",
      "The pairing of a classic cushion-cut diamond with the bezel setting gives it a \"modern, sculptural look,\" which suits Cyrus' style, Taylor says.",
      "The ring aligns with Cyrus' brand and sense of style for other reasons, jewelers say.",
      "Ashleigh Bergman, the founder of Milestones by Ashleigh Bergman, says while the setting is classic, it's not \"classically bridal\" \u2014\u00a0which \"conversely makes it super modern.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s edgy (for bridal), but clean,\" she says.",
      "Page Neal, co-founder of Bario Neal, calls the ring \"modern, unfussy, bold, and deeply self-assured.\"",
      "\u201cIt has the feeling of a piece chosen for the present moment in her life, not an echo of the past,\u201d Neal says.",
      "Neal sees the ring speaking to various trends within the jewelry space, including a shift toward elongated shapes like ovals and marquises; east-west settings and the rise of low, wearable profiles.",
      "Jewelers who spoke to TODAY.com estimate the ring costing between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on factors like provenance of the stone, color, clarity and carat size.",
      "While speaking with People, Cyrus offered the following thoughts on her engagement.",
      "\u201cThe detail that I can share is that for us, our privacy and us kind of keeping it small has been something that I\u2019ve been astounded that I\u2019ve actually been able to have and being able to kind of have more choice,\u201d she says.",
      "Cyrus also explained why she thinks she and Morando have mostly been able to avoid the spotlight, saying, \u201cI think it\u2019s also being older, being more protective of what I\u2019m open to sharing.\u201d"

      "National broadcasters from Spain, Ireland, Slovenia and the Netherlands all said they would not take part in the 2026 contest, citing Israel\u2019s continued participation in the contest amid the war in Gaza.",
      "In public statements on Thursday, Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS cited the \u201chumanitarian suffering in Gaza\u201d and alleged \u201cpolitical interference\u201d in the contest, while Ireland\u2019s RT\u00c9 said its continued participation was \u201cunconscionable given the appalling loss of lives in Gaza and the humanitarian crisis there.\u201d",
      "Alfonso Morales, secretary-general of Spanish broadcaster RTVE, said \u201cthe situation in Gaza, despite the ceasefire and the approval of the peace process, and Israel\u2019s use of the contest for political purposes, make it increasingly difficult to maintain Eurovision as a neutral cultural event.\u201d",
      "RTV Slovenia reaffirmed it \u201cwill not take part in the competition\u201d if Israel does so, adding: \u201cWe remain guided by the values of peace, respect, and equality among nations.\u201d",
      "A push to ban Israel from the contest came to a head at a meeting of broadcasters on Thursday, but no vote was ultimately held on doing so. Austria, the host of next year\u2019s contest, supported Israel\u2019s continued participation.",
      "Israeli broadcaster KAN said in a statement to NBC News that it had engaged in discussions \u201cto prevent Israel\u2019s disqualification from the competition,\u201d with support from Israel\u2019s President Isaac Herzog.",
      "In a post on X, Herzog thanked \u201cfriends who stood up for Israel's right to continue to contribute and compete at Eurovision,\u201d adding: \u201cThis decision demonstrates solidarity, fellowship, and cooperation, and reinforces the spirit of affinity between nations through culture and music.\u201d",
      "Germany, one of the contest\u2019s biggest funders, had threatened to withdraw if Israel was excluded. Its participating broadcaster SWR expressed \"deep regret\" at the boycott but said a vote on excluding Israel was \u201cnot required\u201d as it welcomed other changes to the contest\u2019s rules. Britain\u2019s state broadcaster, the BBC, said it supported the \u201ccollective decision made\u201d on rule changes.",
      "The annual song contest, which marks its 70th anniversary next year, is entered by artists representing countries across Europe and beyond.",
      "Israel has competed since 1973 and is eligible to take part because its broadcaster KAN is a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "But Israeli participation has come under pressure since the war in Gaza began two years ago, with an apparent surge in public support for Israel\u2019s entries as well as protests and calls for a boycott.",
      "Israel\u2019s 2025 entrant, Yuval Raphael, placed first in the public televote during the contest in May, but was ranked significantly lower by the expert juries of music industry professionals who allocate half of the points on offer at the contest.",
      "Last month, Eurovision organizers announced a series of rule changes intended to address fears that the contest\u2019s public vote could be manipulated, as well as restrictions \u201cto curb disproportionate third-party influence, including government-backed campaigns\u201d in support of artists.",
      "The EBU\u2019s own independent news service, citing Google advertising transparency data, reported in May that advertisements from the Israeli government ran across Europe encouraging supporters to \u201cvote up to 20 times\u201d for Raphael.",
      "Raphael is a survivor of the Nova music festival massacre on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters launched a multipronged assault on Israel, killing 1,200 people and abducting about 250.",
      "The rule changes announced last month reduce the maximum number of votes per payment method from 20 to 10, with expanded safeguards to \u201cdetect and prevent fraudulent or coordinated voting activity.\u201d",
      "Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, said the contest would also \u201cstrengthen enforcement of our existing rules to prevent any misuse of the Contest for example through song lyrics or staging.\u201d",
      "In its statement, KAN denied it was \u201cinvolved in any prohibited campaign intended to influence the results of the latest contest.\u201d",
      "The EBU said in a statement that a \u201clarge majority of Members\u201d had agreed with its proposed changes Thursday after \u201ca wide-ranging discussion where Members expressed a variety of views on participation in the Eurovision Song Contest.\u201d",
      "Broadcasters \u201cwill now be asked to confirm their participation,\u201d it said amid speculation that more countries could withdraw, with a final list of participants expected before Christmas.",
      "Russia was previously ejected from the contest in 2022 due to the war in Ukraine. It revived a rival Soviet-era contest, Intervision, earlier this year, which featured entrants from around the globe, including India, China and Saudi Arabia."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A massive fire that tore through a Hong Kong apartment complex, killing more than 150 people, has ignited an upsurge in public anger that is testing Beijing\u2019s control of the Chinese territory.",
      "The Nov. 26 fire at Wang Fuk Court in the northern district of Tai Po has deeply shaken Hong Kong\u2019s population amid accusations of corrupt business practices and failures in government oversight.",
      "The blaze was the city\u2019s first major man-made disaster since national security laws were imposed after huge anti-government protests in 2019, and there have already been several reported arrests and official warnings against \u201canti-China\u201d forces accused of sowing discord.",

    "summary": "After a quiet start, Pope Leo XI, the first American pontiff appears to have found his voice on his trip to Turkey and Lebanon.",
    "story": [
      "After a quiet start, the first American pope appears to be finding his voice.",
      "During his debut foreign trip, to Turkey and Lebanon, Pope Leo XIV projected a papal brand more guarded and less polarizing than that of his predecessor, Pope Francis.",
      "But many Vatican watchers have nonetheless been impressed with his ability to deliver powerful messages \u2014 particularly on issues such as climate change, artificial intelligence, poverty and immigration \u2014 albeit in a subtler way than the man he replaced.",
      "\u201cPope Leo is certainly growing into the role,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a world-leading Vatican expert and professor at Trinity College Dublin. \u201cHe has resisted the temptation to give a sound bite that\u2019s easy to use as a headline,\u201d but \u201cwhen he speaks, he says things that are quite courageous.\u201d",
      "For all the warm reviews, some Vatican watchers have sounded a note of caution: Leo has yet to stake out concrete positions, let alone sharp critiques, on any major issue. Doing so will almost certainly mean disappointing at least one faction in this church of 1.4 billion that he has so deftly kept onside.",
      "Raised in Chicago, Leo, 70, spent much of his working life in Peru, before he was a surprise choice for pope at April\u2019s conclave following the death of Francis. His lower profile meant \u201che was a bit of a mystery\u201d for many Catholics, and he had \u201ca very quiet summer\u201d of study and preparation, Faggioli said.",
      "That started to change as the colder months arrived, with more outspoken comments including his call last month for \u201cdeep reflection\u201d about the treatment of detained migrants in the United States.",
      "On Tuesday, as he held a Mass in Beirut, which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, Leo honored a promise made by Francis, who was prevented from visiting by his late-life illness.",
      "Leo asked \u201cGod for the gift of peace for this beloved land, marked by instability, wars and suffering,\u201d likely a reference to the recent Israel-Hezbollah war, the fallout from a colossal portside explosion in 2020 that killed more than 200 people, and the country\u2019s roiling economic crisis.",
      "Though more than half of the Lebanese population is Muslim, nearly one third are Christian and 5% Catholic, according to 2022 census data. Before Lebanon, Leo visited Turkey to mark the anniversary of the foundation of the Nicene Creed, the standard statement of what all Christians \u2014 Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox \u2014 believe, including the affirmation that Jesus was the son of God.",
      "That highlighted one of the themes of the six-day trip, which was reaching out \u201cboth to other Christian groups, but also to the government of Turkey, and, by extension, to Muslims,\u201d according to Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church who teaches at the University of Oxford.",
      "That\u2019s just one of the ways Leo has followed Francis\u2019 relatively progressive policies and views \u2014 \u201cbut he\u2019s done so with a very different tone and in a different way,\u201d Pattenden said.",
      "Though both men warned against the risks associated with AI, the tech-savvy Leo is the first pontiff \u201cwho seems at ease with the modern world\u201d and pop culture, Pattenden added.",
      "His down-to-earth vibe makes his papacy seem like \u201ca sitcom in which some nice geek from the Midwest in America suddenly found that he had become pope,\u201d Pattenden said. \u201cHe\u2019s got this smile that suggests he himself can\u2019t quite believe it.\u201d",
      "Leo is known to read his speeches word-for-word, a drastic departure from Francis\u2019 habit of going off script. That led to several high-profile faux pas that sent his aides into damage limitation mode.",
      "\u201cTheir gestures and outreach are similar,\u201d said Stan Chu Ilo, a Catholic studies professor at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cBut Pope Francis was quite evidently gregarious and extroverted in nature, whereas the reserved Pope Leo seems quite effective though in communication and has clarity in his thought.\u201d",
      "Even when sticking to his lines, Francis\u2019 pointed and specific pronouncements led to clashes with other world officials, like when he challenged the U.S. on climate change and called for an investigation into whether Israel had committed genocide in Gaza.",
      "Leo has said he supports the two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian territories but told reporters on the plane to Lebanon that \u201cwe are friends with Israel.\u201d",
      "During his trip this week, Leo \u201cspoke and acted very carefully, as if every sentence had been carefully weighted and coined, to avoid misunderstanding or blunt declaration,\u201d said Olivier Roy, a professor at the European University Institute.",
      "And the new pope was well received by many in Lebanon, a country still being bombed by Israel. Just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "\u201cWe think he will bring for us peace, love and hope,\u201d said Pascale Azaz, a nurse watching Leo\u2019s address next to Beirut\u2019s shimmering waterfront Tuesday, the last day of his trip. \u201cWe have been waiting years for this day.\u201d",
      "Nearby, Moussa Abdayem, a yoga instructor, said he hoped the pope \u201cwill inspire us to live in a more peaceful way\u201d in a country where \u201ceverybody\u2019s angry\u201d at the swirling crises besetting his nation.",
      "They aren\u2019t the only ones impressed by Leo\u2019s approach. His centrist stance appears to have calmed divisions between Catholic liberals and conservatives, some of the latter enraged by what they saw as Francis\u2019 abandonment of liturgical traditions such as the Latin mass.",
      "However, occupying such a middle ground does not come without risks.",
      "The closest Leo came to criticism or censure of anyone or anything was making \u201ca heartfelt appeal to those who hold political and social authority, here and in all countries marked by war and violence.\u201d",
      "He told them, \"Listen to the cry of your peoples who are calling for peace!\u201d"

      "BEIRUT \u2014 Holy icons no longer witness Mass at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church in the Lebanese capital and there are no pews five years after an explosion in the main port sent a devastating shock wave through the city.",
      "While new slabs of white marble have replaced the old floor and the walls are freshly painted, the Rev. Miled Abboud is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV\u2019s visit to the blast site Tuesday will highlight the amount of rebuilding that still needs to be done. He also believes Leo's visit will bring \u201ca message of hope\u201d and reconciliation between Lebanon\u2019s diverse Christian communities \u2014 a large number of whom have left in recent years \u2014 and coexistence with the majority Muslim population.",
      "\u201cThe pope\u2019s visit is a sign of hope,\u201d Abboud told NBC News on Saturday. \u201cThere are a lot of bleak things, of things that make us despair, but we have Christ who gives us strength to carry on.\u201d",
      "Abboud, who said he had only been a priest at this Maronite church for a few months, added that he hoped to restore it to its former glory to inspire the local community, although many younger members of his congregation have left the city or country altogether, largely because of the dire economy.",
      "\u201cThe majority of young people have moved to other regions or to the Gulf, to Europe, to France, because we have a lot of French universities here, so once they finish their studies, people move to France,\u201d he said.",
      "Many of them took the decision to leave in the aftermath of the massive August 2020 port explosion, which tore through Beirut after hundreds of tons of ammonium nitrate detonated in a warehouse, according to Paul Salem, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "In total, 218 people were killed and 7,000 others wounded by the blast which devastated large swaths of the city, causing billions of dollars in damages.",
      "Much of the destruction was in \u201cmajority Christian neighborhoods of east Beirut,\u201d Salem said in a series of voice notes Monday. For some it was \u201cthe last straw,\u201d he added.",
      "As much as people loved their homeland, he said, the explosion \u201ctraumatized so many\u201d in the country, which was already reeling from an economic collapse and struggling to cope with an influx of around 1.5 million refugees who crossed into Lebanon as civil war-ravaged neighboring Syria. Some have returned to their country since the overthrow of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year.",
      "Pointing out that members of Christian populations have a long history of migration \u201cfrom the Middle East to the West from the 19th century,\u201d Salem said \u201cthey were attracted to and feel comfortable going to the West, which is generally Christian.\u201d",
      "But, he said, both Christians and Muslims had left during the civil war which wracked the country between 1975 and 1990 and the war with Israel in 2006.",
      "After the economic collapse, he said, \u201cthere weren\u2019t great jobs in Lebanon but there were in Dubai, Abu Dhabi or Riyadh or further afield in Canada or the U.S.\u201d Others had left to pursue higher education in the West, he added.",
      "More recently, the country has been rocked by the spillover of Israel's war in Gaza and also the war between Israel and the Lebanese Shia Muslim militant group Hezbollah until a fragile ceasefire was brokered around a year ago.",
      "But just a week before Leo landed in Beirut, an Israeli airstrike on the city killed Haytham Ali Tabatabai, a senior Hezbollah commander, and four other people, while injuring 28 more.",
      "Elsewhere, some Syrian Christians have left their country amid concerns about the new government under interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, former leader of the Islamist insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. In June, an unprecedented terrorist attack in Damascus on the Greek Orthodox Mar Elias Church during Mass killed at least 30 people and injured 54.",
      "Large numbers had already fled the country, as well as neighboring Iraq, after the Islamic State militant group, or ISIS, declared a caliphate.",
      "In Gaza, the small surviving Christian community has seen churches shelled and worshippers killed during Israel\u2019s war with Hamas, while in the occupied West Bank, Christian communities have been targeted by Israeli settlers and the economy has suffered as tourists' numbers have dropped dramatically.",
      "While Lebanese Christians have lived in relative peace in the Muslim-majority country, the country\u2019s dire economic situation has led many to seek a new life abroad.",
      "\u201cNo one wants to leave their home, especially if their home has been passed down for thousands of years and people have fought for that home to stay there. But we also want to live here with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lteif, 21, told NBC News in an interview Saturday.",
      "Together with his twin, Charbel Lteif, he has set up \u201cEastern Christians\u201d pages on social media, which have racked up almost 700,000 followers.",
      "\u201cOne of the biggest problems we are facing is how many Christians have left,\u201d Charbel Lteif said, adding that with their videos they were trying to raise awareness and preserve their culture and traditions by creating \u201ca new voice for the Christians in the Middle East and North Africa, a voice that is not political, a voice that is not for anyone\u2019s agenda, a voice that is from the Christians of the East to the whole world.\u201d",
      "Charbel Lteif said churches were \u201cstill very alive,\u201d in Lebanon which has the largest percentage of Christians in the Middle East, making up over a third of the population.",
      "A power sharing agreement has been in place since Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943 in which the president is a Maronite Christian, the parliament speaker is a Shia Muslim and the prime minister is a Sunni Muslim.",
      "This makes Lebanon the only Arab country with a Christian head of state, a tradition that continued earlier this year when President Joseph Aoun, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and a Cabinet were elected on reformist platforms and vowed to hold those behind the port explosion to account.",
      "Five years on from the blast, no official has been convicted, and years of obstructions by top officials have stalled an investigation and hampered hopes for justice.",
      "With no centralized effort by the Lebanese government to rebuild the surrounding neighborhoods, many families and business owners used their own money to fix their properties or reached out to charities and grassroots initiatives.",
      "At St. Anthony of Padua, Abboud remained hopeful that it would be restored to its former glory.",
      "\u201cWhen the church is closed, it means we\u2019ve lost a piece of our region,\u201d he said. \u201cI say this as a Christian who truly believes we have a mission with our Muslim brothers: a mission of dialogue, a mission of coexistence, of making peace.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. Navy on Thursday released the results of its investigation into four incidents involving the USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group during its deployment to the Middle East in late 2024 through earlier this year.",
      "The incidents, which occurred between December 2024 and May 2025, involved the loss of three F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets in the Red Sea and a collision between the carrier and a merchant vessel near Port Said, Egypt.",
      "The investigation found that a trip wire failure, poor computer signaling, \u201csubstandard maintenance practices\u201d and \u201coverall low-level knowledge\u201c among some of the carrier group\u2019s personnel contributed to the incidents, according to the report on the investigation. In December 2024, an accidental \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving two F/A-18s, where one was downed and the other was nearly missed, appeared to have occurred in part because of faulty combat systems, the report said.",
      "In April 2024, a fighter jet and a tow tractor were lost because of a maneuver the carrier made to try to avoid incoming fire from Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the report said.",
      "As a result of the findings, the Navy is reviewing some systems and operations and will conduct more personnel training to try to prevent such incidents, according to the recommendations made in the investigation findings.",
      "\u201cThe Navy is committed to being a learning organization,\u201d the vice chief of naval operations, Adm. Jim Kilby, said in a written statement provided by the Navy.",
      "The Navy has said there were no personnel casualties or major injuries related to the incidents.",
      "The Navy\u2019s report said its investigation found that a December 2024 \u201cfriendly fire\u201d incident involving the shooting down of an F/A-18F Super Hornet by the USS Gettysburg, a guided-missile cruiser, was caused by a \u201clack of integrated training opportunities between USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser, and lack of cohesion across the Carrier Strike Group.\u201d",
      "That lack of cohesion \u201ccontributed to the misidentification, and subsequent engagement, of the friendly aircraft and near miss of another,\u201d the report said.",
      "\u201cThe investigation for the F-18 loss in December 2024 was determined that a lack of reintegrated training opportunities between the USS Gettysburg and the Carrier Strike Group contributed to the misidentification and subsequent engagement of the US Navy aircraft,\u201d Kilby said. \u201cThis was manifested through not following procedures, lack of forceful backup on the cruiser and lack of cohesion across Strike Group units.\u201d",
      "Before the incident, the Truman had spent \u201cseveral hours\u201d defending against Houthi-launched anti-ship cruise missiles and one-way attack drones, the report said.",
      "The investigation also found that the USS Truman\u2019s February 2025 collision with a merchant vessel was \u201cavoidable,\u201d according to the report. The team aboard the Truman failed to safely navigate past the vessel.",
      "In addition, an April 2025 incident involving the loss of an F/A-18E Super Hornet and tow tractor was due to evasive maneuvers that the Truman took while responding to an incoming ballistic missile in the Red Sea, the report said. The investigation determined the aircraft brake system failed, in addition to \u201cinsufficient communication between the bridge, flight deck control, and hangar bay control.\u201d",
      "The investigation also found that a May 2025 incident involving another F/A-18 was caused by a failure of the trip wire aboard the USS Truman. Among the reasons, according to the report, were \u201csubstandard maintenance practices, substandard arresting gear, leadership and overall low-level knowledge\u201d among the personnel operating the trip wire."

      "Almost all of NATO's foreign ministers gathered in Brussels on Wednesday, a day after inconclusive Ukraine peace talks between the United States and Russian President Vladimir Putin and as European officials struggled for a seat at the negotiating table.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that despite the absence of Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 believed to be the first time in 22 years that America's top diplomat did not attend a ministerial gathering of this kind \u2014 he remained \"very much involved\" in the process.",
      "Rutte later told journalists that President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts were central to ending the war.",
      "\u201cThere is only one person in the whole world who was able to break the deadlock ... and that is the American president,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Trump said at a gathering of reporters Wednesday that special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner had a good meeting with Putin on Tuesday.",
      "\"What comes out of that meeting? I can\u2019t tell you, because it does take two to tango,\" Trump said.",
      "He added: \"Their impression was that they\u2019d like to, he would like to see the war ended. I think he\u2019d like to get back to dealing a more normal life. I think I\u2019d like to be trading with the United States of America, frankly, instead of losing thousands of soldiers a week. But their impression was very strongly that he\u2019d like to make a deal.\"",
      "Following the meeting with Putin in Moscow, Witkoff and Kushner invited Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, to a meeting in Miami on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Umerov accepted, the official said, and negotiations for a potential peace deal will continue in Florida on Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday on X that world powers need to keep pressuring Russia about the conflict.",
      "\"Right now, the world clearly feels that there is a real opportunity to end the war, and current diplomatic activity in negotiations must be backed by pressure on Russia,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Everything depends on this combination \u2014 constructive diplomacy plus pressure on the aggressor. Both components work toward peace.\"",
      "Some European nations have expressed extreme disquiet at apparently having been sidelined in talks, however.",
      "\u201cFor any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\u201d the E.U.\u2019s chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, told reporters last month.",
      "Lithuania\u2019s national security adviser, K\u0119stutis Budrys, told journalists in Brussels last month that Europe\u2019s security \u201cmust not be discussed without Europe.\u201d",
      "Russia wanted \u201cto push out Americans from Europe and to review the security architecture\u201d on the continent, he added.",
      "Lithuania sits between the Russian territory of Kaliningrad and Belarus, a staunch Kremlin ally, and the Soviet Union occupied it until the end of communism in 1990. It and fellow Baltic states Latvia and Estonia have long feared an emboldened Russia.",
      "European leaders were also blindsided by Trump\u2019s 28-point plan last month, which was seen as leaving not just Ukraine, but also the whole continent vulnerable.",
      "Rubio's absence from the summit was \"unusual,\" said William Alberque, NATO's former arms control director. The last time he could remember such an absence was when Colin Powell was absent in 2003, which was attributed to the start of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.",
      "Asked why Rubio would not meet with NATO allies, especially during the ongoing Ukraine war negotiations, a senior State Department official told NBC News that he \"has already attended dozens of meetings with NATO allies, and it would be completely impractical to expect him at every meeting.\"",
      "Despite having been sidelined in discussions between Moscow and Washington, European leaders could still have \"a direct impact on the talks\" and \"continue to guide the process,\" Alberque said.",
      "He added that \"it may seem that the Europeans are powerless in the face of Trump\u2019s style of leadership\" but that \"we already have seen the so-called 'peace plan' change radically over the past days, with Ukrainian and European concerns increasingly reflected.\"",
      "Before he met with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday, Putin launched into a tirade against Europe, criticizing European leaders for hindering Trump\u2019s peace efforts, from which, he said, Europe has removed itself. Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, he told reporters, but if Europe starts a war, there can be no doubt about Russia\u2019s readiness to respond \u201cright now.\u201d",
      "Stefan Wolff, a professor of international security at England\u2019s University of Birmingham, said Putin's rhetoric was part of the Russian narrative that Europe is undermining Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war and that if it weren't for European obstruction, a deal would long ago have been done.",
      "\"That is probably true, but it's a good thing, because any such deal would be bad for Ukraine, bad for Europe and ultimately bad for the U.S.,\u201d he said.",
      "There was no real expectation of a breakthrough heading into the talks in Moscow, as the Kremlin did not show any intention of easing off on its hard-line demands.",
      "Still, Moscow called the five-hour conversation \u201cuseful\u201d and said some points could be agreed on, while Putin viewed others \u201cnegatively.\u201d The parties also discussed the issue of territories \u2014 a key and very sensitive point for Ukraine \u2014 and some American proposals on that looked \u201cmore or less acceptable\u201d to the Kremlin. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the talks were the first such \u201cdirect exchange of opinions,\u201d adding that Putin did not reject the U.S. plan.",
      "Also Wednesday, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister, Andriy Sybiha, said the U.S. team had invited the Ukrainian delegation to \"continue our talks in America in the near future.\""

      "MOSCOW \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin met with President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy tasked with negotiating an end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, as well as his son-in-law, for a \"constructive\" five-hour meeting Tuesday, but more work needs to be done, Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin, said in a video the Kremlin posted online.",
      "Nearly four years after Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv\u2019s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s government and forced the resignation of his top negotiator.",
      "Kyiv and its allies view Witkoff, the man whom Washington has sent to negotiate with Putin this week, with suspicion after a leaked phone call suggested he was advising Moscow on how to deal with Trump, according to a transcript published by Bloomberg News.",
      "Ushakov said in the Kremlin video that the meeting Tuesday was \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations. \u201cWe specifically discussed territorial issues, without which we see no resolution to the crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "Witkoff presented the Russians with several documents. \u201cThere was a document containing 27 points. We naturally reviewed it. However, we didn\u2019t work on the wording, and there were no discussions with our American colleagues about it,\u201d Ushakov said, noting that the Americans gave the Russians four additional documents.",
      "He added: \u201cA compromise hasn\u2019t been found yet, but some American proposals seem more or less acceptable, but they need to be discussed. Some of the language we\u2019ve been offered is acceptable. The work will continue. It is indeed one of the most important questions.\u201d",
      "Ushakov said that contacts would continue \u201cat the level of representatives, aides and other representatives, in particular with these two people who arrived in the Kremlin today,\u201d but that no meeting between Trump and Putin was scheduled.",
      "Asked by a journalist whether an end to the conflict was now closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow. This has been agreed upon, and contacts will continue.\u201d",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity that aired  Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was necessary to push both sides to reach a deal.",
      "\u201cThis has now become a war of attrition, and sadly, the Russians have shown their willingness to sacrifice 7,000 soldiers a week in an effort to achieve this,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "He added: \u201cOnly Putin can end this war on the Russian side. \u2026 We have tried to bring both sides together and see what proposals we could come up with that both sides could live with. We\u2019re going to do everything we can to make it work.\u201d",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin simply doesn\u2019t want a deal that\u2019s anything short of what it wants,\u201d such as a watered-down security guarantee for Ukraine and territorial concessions by Kyiv, said Michael A. Horowitz, an independent geopolitical and security analyst who has followed the war closely.",
      "From Ukraine\u2019s perspective, acceding to most of Russia\u2019s demands would set it up for a third invasion, \u201cafter 2014 and 2022,\u201d Horowitz added, referring to Russia\u2019s military backing of separatists in Ukraine\u2019s east in 2014 and the full-scale invasion eight years later.",
      "The 'three pillars'",
      "Putin has never hidden his hard-line demands.",
      "He has sought the capture of all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial region of Donbas, comprising the contested Donetsk region and Russian-controlled Luhansk. (Russia holds about one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory.) He has also called for Ukraine to be \u201cdemilitarized,\u201d essentially rendering it defenseless, and a final peace settlement to be acknowledged in international law.",
      "\u201cThere are three pillars on which we will not compromise,\u201d a Russian official briefed on the matter said on condition of anonymity. \u201cOne is the territory of the Donbas. The second is a limit on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces. The third is the recognition of territory by America and Europe.\u201d",
      "Moscow is prepared to be flexible on certain secondary issues, the official said this week, like hundreds of billions in Russian assets frozen in Europe at the beginning of the war. Ukraine and its European allies have called for the funds to be used to boost Ukraine\u2019s shattered economy.",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan envisions that roughly one-third of the frozen assets, or $100 billion, would be invested in the U.S.-led efforts to rebuild Ukraine. According to the original leaked 28-point plan, the U.S. would receive 50% of the profits from the venture. No specific details have been released about the plan that was whittled down to 20 points during Sunday\u2019s talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in Florida.",
      "Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, told NBC News he thinks Putin could be willing to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing you need to understand is he can\u2019t afford to fall out with Trump. It would be quite suicidal,\u201d Gallyamov said. And while the war has not devastated the Russian economy, in the long term Putin understands that ramped-up sanctions by Trump would make economic recovery very difficult, if not impossible, he said.",
      "\u201cIf Trump will really press him, Putin will agree to end the fighting \u2014 maybe with the calculation that he will build up strength, quickly organize some sort of provocation in the spring to blame on the Ukrainians and hit again,\u201d Gallyamov said.",
      "A lot depends on what the Americans demand, Gallyamov said, adding that Putin may be willing to agree to a ceasefire over Christmas and New Year\u2019s.",
      "But Putin is unlikely to truly end the war without intense pressure from the U.S., he said.",
      "What could Putin accept?",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrived in Moscow fresh from talks with Ukraine in Florida this weekend, which both Washington and Kyiv deemed productive, without sharing details.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the last chance for Russia to convince Witkoff, and Witkoff must convince Trump that the Russian view is the correct one,\u201d said Andrei Fedorov, Russia\u2019s former deputy foreign minister.",
      "Putin has signaled for months, even before the diplomatic flurry caused by Trump\u2019s 28-point proposal, that he was willing to continue fighting.",
      "In September, he said he welcomed \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel\u201d in the wake of Trump\u2019s peace efforts in Alaska. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how the situation develops,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cIf not, we\u2019ll have to resolve all the challenges we face militarily.\u201d",
      "He reiterated that last week, saying fighting would stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from the territories they hold. \u201cIf they don\u2019t withdraw, we will achieve this by force,\u201d he said.",
      "The leaked 28-point plan would force Ukraine to cede territory, including land it holds in the Donetsk region. It would limit the Ukrainian army to 600,000, down from more than 800,000 currently. It would also bar Ukraine from ever joining the NATO defense alliance \u2014 which Kyiv has said is a nonstarter.",
      "But according to Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, even the leaked plan did not go far enough for Putin.",
      "The 600,000-personnel limit the plan would impose on the Ukrainian army is one sticking point, she wrote in an analysis last week. It would still leave Kyiv with the largest army in Europe.",
      "The draft plan also did not include a total ban on long-range weapons in Ukraine, she added.",
      "The wording is also important for Putin, Stanovaya said. Putin indicated last week that he would want every word of any peace agreement to be carefully weighed, having mocked the language of the original proposal as undiplomatic and, at times, \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "If he could write his own version of the peace plan, Horowitz said, Putin would legally claim all four Ukrainian provinces he illegally annexed in 2022, not just Donetsk and Luhansk; reduce Ukraine\u2019s army to one-tenth of its current size; complete the so-called denazification of Ukraine, which is code for a Russian say in Ukraine\u2019s future and removal of nationalist parties; and lift all sanctions.",
      "While Putin does not necessarily think those demands would be achievable, Horowitz said, he thinks the final deal should be closer to his ideal peace than that of Ukraine's \u2014 and he is prepared to wait if that\u2019s not the case.",
      "\u201cThe problem, of course, is that this \u2018ideal deal\u2019 means Russia will be encouraged to invade Ukraine again \u2014 beyond what it already occupies,\u201d he added.",
      "Keir Simmons and Natasha Lebedeva reported from Moscow, and Yuliya Talmazan from London."

    "story": [
      "A meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump's envoy and his son-in-law lasted five hours Tuesday but ended without clear progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Russian officials called the meeting with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Moscow \"constructive\" and \"productive.\" But neither side released details of how the talks might bridge the chasm between Russia's unwavering demands and the assurances sought by Ukraine and its frozen-out European backers.",
      "Beforehand, Putin called Europe's attempts to influence the U.S.-led peace talks \"absolutely unacceptable\" and said that while he did not want war with Europe, Russia was ready for one if necessary. Sidelined European powers were meeting Wednesday at a NATO summit in Belgium, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio took the rare step of skipping the summit altogether.",
      "Putin's foreign adviser Yuri Ushakov called Tuesday's meeting \u201cvery useful, constructive\u201d but that the sides agreed not to get into details about the negotiations.",
      "Russian officials had reviewed a number of documents presented by the American delegation, and that some proposals \"seem more-or-less acceptable, but they need to be discussed,\" Ushakov said.",
      "Asked whether an end to the conflict was closer than before, Ushakov replied: \u201cNo further, that\u2019s for sure. But there\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, both in Washington and Moscow.\"",
      "Putin\u2019s special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, posted a single word on X after the meeting: \u201cProductive.\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he was  \"waiting for signals from the American delegation after its meetings in Russia,\" adding that it was important \"everything is fair and transparent and that \"there are no games played behind Ukraine's back.\"",
      "United States officials did not comment on the Moscow talks and the next steps for the American team were not clear.",
      "Zelenskyy said earlier Tuesday, during a meeting with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, that \"if the signals align and if there is fair play from our partners, we may meet very soon.\"",
      "Ukraine and Europe say they are concerned about being sidelined in the negotiations that will directly influence their safety and security on the continent. There are widespread fears that a favorable deal for Putin will embolden him to attack elsewhere.",
      "A leaked 28-point plan the U.S. proposed last month was widely deemed as capitulating to Russia. It would have forced Kyiv to cede its territories to Moscow, including the land that it currently controls. It would have limited the size of Kyiv\u2019s army and barred Ukraine from ever joining NATO.",
      "The proposal blindsided Kyiv, which launched a storm of negotiations in Europe and the U.S. to try to amend the plan and make it more palatable to Ukraine.",
      "It comes as Zelenskyy\u2019s government is on the back foot on the battlefield, while rocked by a major corruption scandal. His powerful chief of staff and top negotiator, Andriy Yermak, resigned last week after being implicated in the probe.",
      "Shortly before his scheduled meeting with the American delegation, Putin addressed an investment forum where he said his army held the advantage in Ukraine, while criticizing European leaders for hindering the peace process.",
      "Russia has no intention of going to war with European countries, but if Europe starts a war, Russia is ready \u201cright now,\u201d Putin told reporters. \"If Europe suddenly wants to start a war with us and does, then we could quickly get a situation in which we have no one to negotiate with.\u201d",
      "Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in what has become Europe\u2019s largest conflict since World War II. Despite Russia expecting Ukraine to surrender in a matter of days, the war has dragged on. The Ukrainian army, backed by Western weapons, has managed to not only resist the onslaught, but also counterattack. Still, Russian forces are now in control of roughly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory.",
      "The Russian leader signaled last week that he was ready for a \u201cserious\u201d discussion with the U.S. and said that a version of the plan that was agreed during talks with Ukrainian officials in Geneva last month could form the \u201cframework\u201d of a final peace settlement. Still, he said his army had the upper hand on the battlefield and if no agreement was reached, he would get what he wanted by force.",
      "Wearing a military uniform, Putin received reports from his generals Monday that Russian troops have completely \u201cliberated\u201d the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub in the Donetsk region. Ukraine denied reports that the city was entirely under Russian control. Pokrovsk\u2019s capture could serve as a springboard for the Russian military to threaten bigger cities and the whole region.",
      "On the streets of Moscow, meanwhile, some expressed hope for an agreement and peace.",
      "\"Everyone is tired of this,\" Igor Andreev, 39, told NBC News in central Moscow, standing on a street opposite the U.S. Embassy. \"I can\u2019t afford many products,\" said Andreev, who works in marketing. \"We are in isolation; I can\u2019t go to another country. Everyone is tired of this situation. I think it needs to end in peace. Everyone is tired of [hearing about] victims. We want love to prevail.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House confirmed Monday that the U.S. did launch a second strike on an alleged drug boat from Venezuela in early September and that it was ordered by Adm. Frank M. Bradley, who at the time headed the Joint Special Operations Command.",
      "The follow-up strike killed the survivors of an initial U.S. strike on the vessel, which the Trump administration has said originated from Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say that second attack could constitute a war crime.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the strikes in question on Sept. 2, Secretary Hegseth authorized Adm. Bradley to conduct these kinetic strikes,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement during Monday's briefing.",
      "\u201cAdm. Bradley worked well within his authority and the law directing the engagement to ensure the boat was destroyed and the threat to the United States of America was eliminated,\" she added.",
      "U.S. Special Operations Command, which Bradley now leads as commander, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Washington Post reported that Bradley had ordered the second strike, and that he was complying with an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to \u201ckill everybody.\u201d NBC News has not confirmed the detail about Hegseth.",
      "One U.S. official and a source familiar with the Pentagon\u2019s actions on Sept. 2 told NBC News recently that the first of the two strikes conducted that day left at least two survivors, with the subsequent strike killing them.",
      "Hegseth, in a social media post Monday night, also indicated that Bradley ordered the second strike. \"Let\u2019s make one thing crystal clear: Admiral Mitch Bradley is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made \u2014 on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"",
      "On Sunday, President Donald Trump told reporters that Hegseth didn't order the second strike.",
      "\"He said he didn't do it,\" said Trump, who also said he didn't know if the second strike even happened. The president said he \"wouldn't have wanted\" it, adding that \"Pete said he did not want them.\" Asked again if there was no second strike, Trump said: \"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.\"",
      "Asked Monday what law the U.S. military relied on to justify the second strike, Leavitt said: \u201cThe strike conducted on Sept. 2 was conducted in self-defense to protect Americans in vital United States interests. The strike was conducted in international waters and in accordance with the law of armed conflict.\u201d",
      "She also confirmed that Trump would be meeting with his national security team \u2014 which includes Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller \u2014 in the Oval Office later Monday. A senior White House official confirmed Monday night that the meeting had wrapped.",
      "Leavitt's comments come amid widespread criticism and bipartisan investigations in the House and Senate into the second boat strike. The leaders of the Senate Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I. \u2014 said in a statement Friday that they will be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances.\"",
      "Similarly, the leaders of the House Armed Services Committee \u2014 chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., and ranking member Adam Smith, D-Wash. \u2014 said they were taking \"seriously the reports of follow-on strikes on boats alleged to be ferrying narcotics in the SOUTHCOM region and are taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question.\"",
      "Smith told reporters Monday night that he would be receiving a classified briefing this week from Bradley about the strikes. He added that it would be \"helpful\" to have Hegseth testify.",
      "The details of the briefing with Bradley are still being worked out, Smith said, but he indicated that they are aiming for it to take place Thursday.",
      "Bradley is expected to be in Washington this week to speak with senior lawmakers about the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter.",
      "Wicker, who also said he will be speaking with Bradley, said Monday that he has spoken with Hegseth about the second strike. The defense secretary is also expected to have spoken or is soon speaking with other lawmakers, according to two other people familiar with matter.",
      "Wicker and Smith both said they have spoken with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Hegseth has defended the numerous U.S. strikes in the Caribbean, saying in a post on X Friday after The Washington Post article was published that \"these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be 'lethal, kinetic strikes.'\"",
      "\"Our current operations in the Caribbean are lawful under both U.S. and international law, with all actions in compliance with the law of armed conflict \u2014 and approved by the best military and civilian lawyers, up and down the chain of command,\" he wrote.",
      "Hegseth received backlash on social media after he posted on his personal X account what appeared to be an AI-generated image of the children's book character Franklin, with the title, \"Franklin targets Narco Terrorists.\" It shows Franklin, a turtle, standing on the edge of a helicopter aiming a machine gun at boats allegedly carrying drugs.",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean are part of an escalating pressure campaign the Trump administration is waging against Venezuela. Trump declared in a Truth Social post Saturday that Venezuela's airspace should be considered \"closed,\" which came as the U.S. is considering military action against the South American nation."

      "In accordance with \u201cguidelines and procedures,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s  request is \u201ccurrently being transferred to the Pardons Department in the Ministry of Justice which will gather the opinions of all the relevant authorities,\u201d read the statement, without indicating when a decision might be reached.",
      "In his video message, Netanyahu also cited Trump\u2019s recent appeal for the trial to be canceled, saying it would allow the two leaders to \u201cpromote more vigorously the vital interests shared by Israel and the United States in a window of time that is unlikely to return.\u201d",
      "Trump penned a letter to Herzog two weeks ago asking the president to grant Netanyahu a full pardon.",
      "At the time, Herzog\u2019s office had said that \u201canyone seeking a pardon must submit a request in accordance with the established procedures.\u201d",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir both immediately backed the proposed pardon on Sunday, with Katz citing the \u201ccomplex security reality\u201d in Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has previously cited the war in Gaza and security concerns while seeking delays in the court proceedings.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid said that there should be no pardon without \"an admission of guilt, an expression of remorse, and an immediate withdrawal from political life.\"",
      "Benny Gantz, another political rival of Netanyahu\u2019s, said that the pardon request was \u201cfake\u201d and urged the leader: \u201cInstead of fanning the flames, extinguish the fire you created within Israeli society.\u201d",
      "In an unrelated case, the International Criminal Court last year issued a warrant for Netanyahu\u2019s arrest over alleged war crimes committed in Gaza.",
      "Both Israel and the U.S. do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC. The warrant theoretically puts Netanyahu at risk of arrest if he steps foot in an ICC member country, though the body has no police force and is reliant on international cooperation.",
      "Israel responded furiously to the warrants, with Netanyahu\u2019s office branding the decision as \u201cantisemitic\u201d and rejecting the charges as \u201cabsurd and false.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Just as peace talks were gaining traction, Ukraine has lost its lead negotiator.",
      "Andriy Yermak, an ever-present figure at President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s side throughout the war with Russia, resigned as chief of staff on Friday after an anti-corruption raid at his home, injecting fresh uncertainty for Ukraine\u2019s leadership.",
      "The exit leaves a vacuum around Zelenskyy as talks accelerate, isolating the Ukrainian president at a critical moment and creating an opening Moscow may try to exploit, analysts say.",
      "The development capped a dramatic week, which began with Kyiv under intense pressure from President Donald Trump to endorse a plan that aligned with Moscow\u2019s hard-line demands. An initial deadline of Thursday, imposed by the White House, passed without any announcement as Ukraine and its allies pushed back against calls for the country to cede territory.",
      "Ukrainian negotiators, led by Yermak, secured changes, and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff will now head to Moscow for talks next week with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Russia still wants to move toward peace despite its belief that Zelenskyy was not a legitimate leader.",
      "But analysts warn that Yermak\u2019s departure leaves Kyiv navigating unfamiliar waters, as Zelenskyy is forced to steer Ukraine through high-stakes negotiations without his most trusted aide.",
      "Yermak\u2019s resignation comes at a \u201cvery bad time, because we\u2019re really at a possible tipping point where you know what Ukraine is demanding may not be granted or taken into consideration,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News by phone on Saturday.",
      "\u201cNone of us really know what Zelenskyy is like operating solo, because he never has,\u201d he said, adding that Yermak has \u201cbasically stood in\u201d for Zelenskyy at times.",
      "Rustem Umerov, the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, will lead Ukraine\u2019s delegation for a round of talks in the U.S. on Sunday, Zelenskyy said in a post on X. Umerov has also been mentioned by anti-corruption investigators. Neither he nor Yermak have faced charges.",
      "Bociurkiw added that Yermak\u2019s departure would be unlikely to change Ukraine\u2019s firm stance on territorial concessions, but that Russia \u201cwill try to manipulate and take advantage of this vacuum.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were due to attend Sunday\u2019s talks, a U.S. official told NBC News.",
      "Michael A. Horowitz, a Jerusalem-based geopolitical consultant, echoed Bociurkiw\u2019s concerns, saying that Yermak\u2019s resignation, just days before major U.S.-Ukraine-Russia talks and a potential Trump-Putin summit, \u201cdisrupts Kyiv\u2019s preparations and invites counterparts to probe whether Ukraine\u2019s red lines on territory and NATO can be eased during the transition.\u201d",
      "But in the long term, Horowitz told NBC News on Saturday, Yermak\u2019s departure could even be a positive.",
      "Critics have said for years that Yermak had accumulated too much power and wielded excessive influence over Zelenskyy. A constant presence by the president\u2019s side through the ups and downs of the war, Yermak had emerged as one of the few men that the Ukrainian leader appeared to really trust.",
      "Zelenskyy has previously railed against corrupt officials, but signs that a corruption scandal may have stretched into his inner circle may provide more ammunition to critics of further support for Ukraine. Trump-aligned figures, including Vice President JD Vance, have previously criticized Ukraine for its issues with corruption.",
      "Yermak\u2019s departure may \u201creinforce skepticism within the Trump administration\u201d about Zelenskyy\u2019s inner circle, giving them further reasons to push for concessions, said Natia Seskuria, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "But Horowitz said the resignation \u201cremoves a lightning rod for controversy and gives Kyiv a cleaner, more collective mandate to say no to an unfair and unsustainable peace,\u201d adding: \u201cZelenskyy is getting his house in order.\u201d",
      "When it comes to how the rule of law is being enforced in Ukraine, \u201cgenerally this is a good sign,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s bad enough that these accusations existed in the first place,\u201d he added, but \u201ceven those in the highest places are prosecuted when suspicions arise.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said in a video statement on Friday that he was looking for Yermak\u2019s replacement. \u201cRussia really wants Ukraine to make mistakes,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be no mistakes on our part.\u201d",
      "Losing unity could mean losing the country and its future, he added.",
      "But Bociurkiw said time is \u201cnot on Ukraine\u2019s side right now.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re Ukraine at the moment, he added, \u201cyou need not only a physical army, but an army of diplomats and advocates.\u201d"
