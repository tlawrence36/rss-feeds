      "The Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and the historian whose book inspired it are getting the National Constitution Center\u2019s Liberty Medal this fall",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and the historian whose book inspired it will collect the National Constitution Center's Liberty Medal this fall, an award for efforts to spread liberty around the world.",
      "Ron Chernow and \u201c Hamilton \u201d will collect the medal and its $100,000 cash prize at an event in October on Philadelphia's Independence Mall.",
      "Award organizers credited the book and musical for having a \u201csingular impact\u201d by bringing to life and spreading the story of the U.S. Constitution and Alexander Hamilton, a pivotal figure in drafting and promoting the governing document. He was also the first U.S. treasury secretary.",
      "\u201cHamilton,\u201d which debuted on Broadway a decade ago, has become a cultural touchstone, winning the Pulitzer Prize, a Grammy and 11 Tony awards.",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda, who created the musical, called the award a deep honor.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution is not just a historical artifact \u2014 it\u2019s a challenge. A call to participate. To speak up, to imagine better, and to work, every day, toward that more perfect union,\u201d he said in a statement released before the formal announcement.",
      "Chernow's many books have included biographies of former presidents George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant and, more recently, of writer and humoristMark Twain.",
      "\u201cIn writing about Hamilton, Washington, and Grant, I\u2019ve come to see that liberty is not a gift passed down through generations \u2014 it\u2019s a responsibility,\u201d Chernow said in a statement. \u201cOne that demands courage, compromise, and commitment. These men were imperfect, but they dared to envision something greater than themselves.\u201d",
      "The Liberty Medal was established in 1988 to honor the 200th anniversary of the U.S. Constitution's 1787 signing. Recent winners have included the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and PBS documentary filmmaker Ken Burns.",

      "The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music",
      "LONDON -- The Glastonbury Festival is making headlines for controversy rather than music.",
      "The likes of Olivia Rodrigo, Rod Stewart, Neil Young, Charli XCX, Busta Rhymes and Doechii played to tens of thousands onsite, and millions more on TV, during Britain\u2019s biggest and most famous music extravaganza. But it\u2019s little-known rap-punk duo Bob Vylan attracting politicians\u2019 ire \u2014 and a police probe \u2014 after leading a chant calling for \u201cdeath\u201d to the Israeli military.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time politics has collided with pop at the festival. For half a century, Britain\u2019s big political and cultural divides have found their way onstage at Glastonbury.",
      "The Glastonbury Festival of Contemporary Performing Arts, to give it its full name, was founded by Michael Eavis in 1970 on his Worthy Farm, 120 miles (some 200 kilometers) southwest of London. It\u2019s still run by the 90-year-old farmer and his daughter, Emily Eavis.",
      "Originally a hippie happening with a 1 pound ticket price (about 20 pounds or $27 today), Glastonbury has largely shed its counterculture cachet. These days, tickets for the three-day event cost close to 400 pounds. But it remains famous for its eclectic lineup, unique atmosphere and commitment to environmentalism and other progressive causes.",
      "This year\u2019s event drew about 200,000 people to see almost 4,000 performers on 120 stages, alongside film screenings and live debates on a variety of issues.",
      "Glastonbury was founded in a spirit of hippie idealism that has never entirely faded. In the 1980s, the festival donated some of its profits to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which protested U.S. nuclear weapons on British soil. It continues to support charities including Oxfam and Greenpeace.",
      "By the late 1980s, attendees included New Age \u201ctravelers\u201d involved with the U.K.\u2019s unofficial and anarchic rave scene. In 1990, some travelers clashed with security at the site, leading to significant damage and more than 200 arrests.",
      "Since then, the festival\u2019s security and organization have grown increasingly professional, sparking regret from some fans who feel it has lost its alternative spirit.",
      "The 2016 festival coincided with the U.K.\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, and the decision to leave the bloc \u2014 which most young people opposed \u2014 overshadowed the event. Many performers mentioned Brexit and the dispirited mood, including headliner Adele, who urged people to \u201clook after each other.\u201d",
      "Performers have often vented their opposition to politicians from the stage. In 2019, rapper Stormzy led the crowd in \u201cF___ Boris\u201d chants aimed at then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson. This year, Irish rappers Kneecap directed the same expletive at Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "In contrast, then-Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn was warmly received at the festival in 2017 after doing better than expected against the Conservatives in a general election.",
      "Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza has provoked heightened emotions that spilled over onto Glastonbury\u2019s stages.",
      "Before the event, some politicians called for Glastonbury to cancel a performance by Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap, whose pro-Palestinian comments, critics say, have crossed a line into support for violence.",
      "Kneecap member Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh has been charged under the Terrorism Act with supporting a proscribed organization for allegedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in London in November. He denies the charge, and Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause.",
      "Kneecap\u2019s energetic set included plenty of pro-Palestinian comments and criticism of the government. But it was the act that preceded them, Bob Vylan, that caused a furor when a member of the duo led chants of \u201cdeath to the IDF,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The Avon and Somerset Police force said officers would review video evidence \u201cto determine whether any offenses may have been committed that would require a criminal investigation.",
      "Michael and Emily Eavis said Bob Vylan had \u201cvery much crossed a line.\u201d They said \u201cthere is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s publicly funded national broadcaster is under fire for showing Bob Vylan\u2019s set, one of dozens of Glastonbury performances it streamed live online.",
      "The BBC said Monday that it should have cut off the broadcast after the \u201cantisemitic\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d comments, and has removed the performance from its website. But the government is demanding to know what \u201cdue diligence\u201d it did on Bob Vylan before the broadcast.",
      "Some media experts say the broadcaster is in a difficult position. Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said Britain\u2019s influential right-wing press,\u201d including newspapers such as the Daily Mail and The Sun, frequently attack the BBC, \u201cfor both commercial and ideological reasons.\u201d",
      "Right-leaning newspapers featured the Bob Vylan story prominently, and Barnett said that attention \u201cputs any political leader under enormous pressure\u201d to express an opinion.",

      "The building housing the space was designed by architect Eric Owen Moss, who is known for creating some of the area's most distinctive and unconventional structures.",

      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",

      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "A prosecutor began two days of closing arguments at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial by telling a jury that the music mogul used \u201cpower, violence and fear\u201d to rule a criminal enterprise for two decades",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",

      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "Country singer Parker McCollum will release his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",
      "He thought, \u201cThat song is going to be cut at some point or another in my career. Might as well make it now.\u201d",
      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give a (expletive) anymore. Whatever it is that I do sound like, you know, that\u2019s what I wanna do.\u201d",
      "As long as the songs \u201cmake you feel something.\u201d",
      "That's something fans have long connected to, since the release of his debut, \u201cThe Limestone Kid,\u201d a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt really eats at me to put out music that hits you where music hits me,\u201d he says. \u201cI really enjoy that chase and that journey of, \u2018Am I going to write songs that are good enough?\u2019 ... I\u2019m trying to find those answers.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, heralding the start of Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle",
      "PARIS -- The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019 Pompidou Center Tuesday, clearing the way for a different kind of flight: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z swept into the front row.",
      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep.

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday threw out appellate rulings in favor of transgender people in four states following the justices' recent decision upholding a Tennessee ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youths.",
      "But the justices took no action in cases from Arizona, Idaho and West Virginia involving the participation of transgender students on school sports teams. The court could say as soon as Thursday whether it will take up the issue in its next term.",
      "The high court ordered appellate judges to reexamine cases from Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and West Virginia involving access to medical care and birth certificates.",
      "The action was unsurprising because the court had set the cases aside until after it decided the Tennessee case, as typically happens when the same legal issue is being considered.",
      "The rulings all included findings that the restrictions on transgender people imposed by the states violate the Constitution's equal protection clause.",
      "In the Tennessee case, the Supreme Court ruled that there was no constitutional violation in a state law prohibiting puberty blockers and hormone therapy to treat gender dysphoria in people younger than 18.",
      "The justices ordered the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, to review its decision that West Virginia\u2019s and North Carolina\u2019s refusal to cover certain health care for transgender people with government-sponsored insurance is discriminatory.",

      "The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will review its ruling blocking an Oklahoma ban on people changing their gender on birth certificates.",

      "A Ukrainian woman, Olha Kurtmalaieva, has endured cancer and war while fighting to bring her husband home from Russian captivity",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 \u201cYou have no moral right to die.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s what Olha Kurtmalaieva told herself as she lay in intensive care, her body shutting down after emergency chemotherapy. Her cancer had progressed to Stage 4, meaning it had spread to other parts of her body and was now incurable. The pain was unbearable. The doctors weren\u2019t sure she\u2019d make it through the night.",
      "She was facing death alone in the Ukrainian capital, while her soldier husband was in Russian captivity in the more than three-year war.",
      "\u201cIf I die now, who will bring him back?\" Olha thought to herself. \"He has no one else in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Against the odds, she learned she was in remission last year. But even after multiple prisoner exchanges, including one that freed over 1,000 people, her husband, a Ukrainian marine, remains a captive.",
      "She hasn\u2019t given up. At nearly every exchange, she\u2019s there waiting, one of hundreds of Ukrainian women still trying to bring home their husbands, sons and brothers.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s everywhere in my life,\u201d Olha said. \u201cHis (photo) is on my phone screen, in my wallet, on the kitchen wall, in every room.\u201d",
      "Day and night, questions circled in her mind: \u201cWhat can I do to speed this up? What did I do today to bring him home?\u201d",
      "Olha was just 21 when she learned she had cancer. It was Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Stage 2. The tumors were growing but were still treatable.",
      "\u201cAt that age, you\u2019re thinking: cancer? Why me? How? What did I do?\u201d she recalled. Her husband, Ruslan Kurtmalaiev, promised to stay by her side through every round of chemotherapy.",
      "When they met, in 2015, he was 21 and she was just 15. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight,\u201d she said with a wide smile, eyes sparkling.",
      "Their attraction blossomed gradually that summer in Berdiansk, in what is now the Russian-occupied zone in the southern Zaporizhzhia region. Three years later, as soon as she turned 18, they wed.",
      "When they first met, it was not long after Russia illegally seized Crimea, Ruslan's homeland, in 2014, and also invaded eastern Ukraine. Ruslan, a professional soldier, had already served on the front line.",
      "From the beginning, Olha understood that life as a military wife meant constant sacrifice \u2014 long separations, missed milestones, and the uncertainty of war. But she never imagined that one day she would be waiting for her husband to return from captivity.",
      "When she describes Ruslan, tears well up in her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s kind, he has a heightened sense of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor him, it was a matter of principle to return home and bring our Crimea home,\u201d she said, a loss she fully comprehended only after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "\u201cOnly when I lost my home did I fully understand him.\"",
      "Olha managed to complete only two sessions of chemo before the full-scale invasion. When her long hair began to fall out, she shaved her head. When she sent Ruslan a photo, he didn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he told her.",
      "Later, he made a confession.",
      "\u201cHe told me, \u2018Yeah, I saw your hair falling out in the mornings. I gathered it all from your pillow before you woke up \u2014 so you wouldn\u2019t get upset.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she believed that losing her hair was the worst thing that could happen to her. But soon after, she discovered what real tragedy meant.",
      "Olha never made it to her third round of chemo.",
      "She stayed in Berdiansk, which was seized by Russian forces in the early days of the war. Cut off from medical care and waiting for news of Ruslan, she quietly began helping the Ukrainian military from inside occupied territory.",
      "\u201cThere was no oncology department in Berdiansk. There was simply nowhere to get treated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, I didn\u2019t even care that much at the time.\u201d",
      "In early April, she discovered that Russians had captured Ruslan and others from his marine forces\u2019 unit.",
      "\u201cI started to cry, but then I stopped myself. I thought, \u2018Wait. Is this something to cry about? He\u2019s alive. That\u2019s what matters.\u2019\u201d",
      "At the time, she said, their idea of Russian captivity was naive. Only later did it become synonymous with torture, starvation and medical neglect.",
      "Olha left Berdiansk in June of 2022.",
      "\u201cWalking through your own city, but feeling like it\u2019s someone else\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were Russian flags everywhere. I kept Ukrainian music in my headphones. I was scared my Bluetooth might disconnect, and they\u2019d kill me. But it was worth it.\u201d",
      "She spent several months moving between cities, helping to organize peaceful rallies to raise awareness about Ukrainian POWs. Eventually, she settled in Kyiv. Throughout that time, she paid little attention to her cancer diagnosis, even as her health steadily declined.",
      "Then her condition worsened sharply. Her temperature spiked to 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).",
      "\u201cWhen the doctor looked at my test results, she said, \u2018How are you even walking?\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Her lymphoma, left untreated during occupation, had progressed to Stage 4. Emergency chemotherapy began \u2014 and it hit her hard.",
      "\u201cMy second round of chemo was disastrous,\u201d she said. She developed an intestinal blockage, couldn\u2019t digest food, and was rushed to intensive care. \u201cIt was morphine all night from the pain. I couldn\u2019t stand. I couldn\u2019t sit. They moved me like a dead body.\u201d",
      "In the hospital, she overheard doctors say her condition was inoperable. Then a nurse came to her bedside and spoke plainly.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to try to restart your system manually,\u2019 she told me. \u2018But if it doesn\u2019t work, you may not wake up tomorrow. You must help us however you can.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was the thought of Ruslan, still in captivity, that helped Olha survive.",
      "In April 2024, five days before her birthday, Olha was told she was in remission. Now she juggles civic activism with running an online cosmetics store. She co-founded the Marine Corps Strength Association, representing over 1,000 Ukrainian POWs still in captivity.",
      "In close contact with former prisoners, Olha gathers fragments of information about Ruslan \u2014 she has had only one phone call with him in the past three years. She sent several letters but never received a reply.",
      "Like an investigator, she pieces together every detail. That\u2019s how she discovered that Ruslan had broken ribs and a crushed arm during regular beatings, according to the testimony of one of the POWs.",
      "As part of the psychological torture, he is made to listen to the Russian national anthem repeatedly. A Crimean Tatar and a Muslim, he is given only Christian religious texts to read \u2014 not the worst form of pressure, Olha acknowledges, but still a clear violation of his faith.",
      "One day, a Russian guard struck him eight times on the head with a hammer.",
      "\u201cThe other prisoners said they had never seen bruises like that in their lives,\u201d she said.",
      "Ruslan spent months in solitary confinement. And yet, somehow, he remains emotionally strong.",
      "\u201cHe tells the others about me,\u201d Olha said, her voice softening. \u201cOne of the guys who came back said (Ruslan) told him: \u2018She\u2019s your age, but she\u2019s got a business, she\u2019s strong, she\u2019s fighting for us. She\u2019ll get us out.\u2019\u201d",
      "That story stayed with her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t afford to be weak. How can a marine\u2019s wife be weak?\u201d Olha said. \u201cWhat matters is that he knows I\u2019ll keep fighting for him \u2014 until the very end.\"",

    "story": [
      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "Philadelphia\u2019s public schools are facing federal criminal allegations of failing to properly inspect eight schools for damaged asbestos",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Federal prosecutors on Thursday charged Philadelphia's public schools with failing to properly inspect eight schools for damaged asbestos. The district agreed to have the criminal case deferred while a court keeps tabs on its response.",
      "Prosecutors said it was the first time a school district in the U.S. has faced such environmental criminal allegations.",
      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",
      "Authorities said a judge must approve the terms of the deferred prosecution agreement, which avoids a grand jury indictment. If the school district complies with the relevant federal law, the government can eventually drop the charges.",
      "About 300 of the school district's aging set of 339 buildings contain asbestos, the U.S. attorney's office said in a release.",
      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",
      "Investigators said some asbestos was improperly addressed and that schools have had to close as a result of asbestos problems. Prosecutors said the \u201clongstanding and widespread problem\u201d put students and teachers in danger.",
      "The deferred prosecution agreement says the school system has already improved policies, procedures and compliance regarding asbestos inspections and abatement.",
      "Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. told The Philadelphia Inquirer the deferred prosecution agreement is a sign of the district's progress in addressing the problem. He noted the district will train workers on asbestos management as part of the deal.",
      "___",
      "This story has been corrected to delete a reference to a district paid monitor. The U.S. attorney\u2019s office says that is not a part of the deferred prosecution agreement.",

State health officials say they are determining the vaccination status of people being held at the facility and are providing testing kits and equipment.",
      "As of Friday, the U.S. has 1,227 measles cases nationwide as of Tuesday, including active outbreaks in 12 states.",
      "The highly contagious and vaccine-preventable illness has been spreading in New Mexico since February, starting first in Lea County \u2014 just across the border from the epicenter of the historic Texas outbreak that has sickened 750 people since late January.",
      "New Mexico had 81 confirmed measles cases Tuesday, with Thursday's announcement bringing the total to 86. One state resident died of measles in March. The adult was unvaccinated and did not seek medical care.",
      "\u201cThe cases at Luna County Detention Center are a stark reminder that the measles outbreak in New Mexico is not over,\u201d said Dr. Chad Smelser, a medical epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health. \u201cWe urge everyone in New Mexico, especially Luna County residents, to ensure that they are fully vaccinated against measles.\u201d",
      "Health officials put out an alert June 17 about measles being found Deming\u2019s wastewater system, an early sign that the virus was spreading.",
      "Pablo Montoya, the facility's warden, said in a statement that the first signs of illness started a week ago and all five incarcerated people who tested positive are now in quarantine. All in-person visits are suspended and court hearings will be held virtually.",
      "New Mexico has seen a large increase in measles vaccinations since February. More than 37,500 doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine had been administered as of Monday, state data shows, compared to about 19,300 in the same timeframe of 2024.",
      "The measles vaccine is safe and it is 97% effective at protecting against measles after two doses. It is recommended as a routine vaccination for children across the U.S.",

      "The Trump administration\u2019s vaccine advisers are bringing up an old flu-shot debate: whether it\u2019s time to wipe out the last small fraction of those vaccines that contain a controversial preservative called thimerosal.",
      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",
      "Some public health experts contend the thimerosal discussion will unnecessarily raise doubt in vaccines while possibly also making them more expensive and harder to get this fall.",
      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

      "Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",
      "She vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans' health.",
      "Monarez declined to say whether she had disagreed with any of Kennedy's decisions regarding the agency to date, saying he has \u201claid out a very clear vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

Help establish new green spaces, join projects to protect water, develop wildlife corridors, or decrease pesticide use to save frogs, insects and birds. Work to get the word out on turning down nighttime lighting to help birds and lightning bugs.",
      "\u201cI see people struggling with these emotions across the age range,\u201d said Robinson. \u201cI have parents who are themselves really struggling with their own feelings and really worried about their children in the future.\u201d",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably ordered more MRIs than I ever have in 25 years in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's to make sure we\u2019re getting it right for the (coaching) staff, for the kids, for the kid's family. There\u2019s that much more riding on it.\u201d",
      "A former Penn State football team doctor, Scott Lynch, alleged in 2019 that coach James Franklin attempted to interfere with medical decisions.",
      "A Penn State internal review found evidence of \u201cfriction\u201d between Lynch and Franklin but could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions. Lynch was awarded $5.25 for wrongful termination by the hospital that had employed him.",
      "Dr. David McAllister, head team physician at UCLA who has been practicing for 27 years, said the relationship between team doctor and athlete has gone from one built on trust to now being transactional and at times adversarial.",
      "When athletes spent four or five years at the same school, as once was the norm, friendships were formed and the team doctor continued to provide care for the some athletes long after their playing days. Now, McAllister said, many football and basketball players are taking advice from agents and business managers whose priority is the athlete\u2019s earning power, and that puts pressure on team physicians.",
      "\u201cThere are seasoned, experienced people that do what I do who either recently got out of it or are really considering it because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to the liability,\u201d McAllister said, \u201cand they don\u2019t find it that much fun anymore.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The FDA previously has said that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- A 92-year-old man on Monday was convicted of the rape and murder of a woman in southwestern England in what is thought to be the UK\u2019s longest-running cold case ever to be solved.",
      "A jury at Bristol crown court found Ryland Headley, then aged 34, guilty of attacking 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in June 1967.",
      "\u201cLouisa Dunne died in a horrifying attack carried out in the place where she should have felt safest \u2014 her own home,\u201d prosecutor Charlotte Ream said. \u201cFor 58 years, this appalling crime went unsolved and Ryland Headley, the man we now know is responsible, avoided justice.\u201d",
      "Dunne was found dead in her home by a neighbor on June 28, 1967. The cause of her death was found to be strangulation and asphyxiation. She had also been raped.",
      "Investigators retained Dunne\u2019s clothing, including a blue skirt, and other samples from her body for further examination. They also recovered a palm print from a window which Headley is believed to have used to gain entry to her home.",
      "In 2023, the case was reexamined and the skirt was sent away for forensic testing in May last year. DNA recovered from the item of clothing linked Headley to the murder scene after his DNA was added to the national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.",
      "Forensic scientists concluded that DNA from the skirt matched Headley\u2019s and the palm print was also his. Headley was arrested at his home in Suffolk in November.",
      "Headley was convicted of two counts of rape in the late 1970s, after he attacked women, aged 79 and 84, in Ipswich. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 1978 and was jailed for seven years.",
      "Testimonies of the two women were read during Headley\u2019s 2025 trial.",
      "\u201cHearing the voices of the victims of his 1977 offences, is just incredibly powerful and harrowing,\u201d said Detective Inspector Dave Marchant, senior investigating officer for the case. \u201cI think it gives us an insight into probably what happened within 58 Britannia Road (Dunne\u2019s home) to some degree.\"",
      "Dunne\u2019s granddaughter Mary Dainton said she was stunned when she heard that Headley had been arrested. \u201cI accepted that some murders just never get solved and some people have to live with that emptiness and sadness,\u201d she said.",
      "Marchant said he is working with the National Crime Agency to determine whether Headley may be responsible for any other unsolved offenses over the years. \u201cCrimes of this magnitude should never go unpunished and we will remain relentless in ensuring we do everything we can to advance other unsolved murder cases in the Avon and Somerset area,\u201d he said.",
      "Headley will be sentenced on Tuesday.",

      "Danish women who turn 18 after Tuesday will be entered into the draft lottery system for military service",
      "HOVELTE, Denmark -- Peering across a dense stretch of woodland outside of Denmark's capital with camouflage paint smeared across her face, 20-year-old Katrine scans the horizon for approaching threats.",
      "After nearly four months of military training, the young soldier and the rest of her unit spent early June completing their final exercises near the Danish army\u2019s barracks in Hovelte, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "Katrine and other female soldiers, all of whom spoke to The Associated Press on June 11 on the condition that only their first names be used because of operational security, volunteered for military service earlier this year. Until now, that was the only way women were allowed to partake in military service, although women have been able to enlist as full-time members of the armed forces since the early 1970s",
      "The Scandinavian country is seeking to increase the number of young people in the military by extending compulsory enlistment to women for the first time. Men and women can both still volunteer, and the remaining places will be filled by a gender-neutral draft lottery.",
      "\u201cIn the situation the world is in now, it\u2019s needed,\u201d Katrine said. \u201cI think it\u2019s only fair and right that women participate equally with men.\u201d",
      "Under new rules passed by Denmark\u2019s parliament earlier in June, Danish women who turn 18 after Tuesday will be entered into the lottery system, on an equal footing with their male compatriots. The change comes against a backdrop of Russian aggression and growing military investment across NATO countries.",
      "Even from the relative safety of Denmark, Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine casts its shadow. Lessons from the Ukrainian battlefields have even filtered down into their training.",
      "\u201cThat makes it very real,\u201d Katrine said.",
      "Denmark's gender-parity reforms were originally outlined in 2024 as part of a major defense agreement. The program was originally expected to be implemented by early 2027, but has been brought forward to summer 2025.",
      "Col. Kenneth Str\u00f8m, head of the conscription program, told AP the move is based on \u201cthe current security situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey could take part in NATO collective deterrence,\u201d Str\u00f8m added. \u201cRaising the number of conscripts, that would simply lead to more combat power.\u201d",
      "Denmark, a nation of 6 million people, has about 9,000 professional troops. The new arrangement is expected to bring the figure up to 6,500 people doing military service annually by 2033, up from 4,700 last year.",
      "Under Danish law, all physically fit men over age 18 are called up for military service. Some people \u2014 both men and women \u2014 volunteer, and the rest of the places are filled by a lottery system that until now has only involved men. Women volunteers make up roughly a quarter of 2024\u2019s cohort.",
      "\u201cSome will probably be very disappointed being chosen to go into the military,\u201d Anne Sofie, part of Katrine\u2019s cohort of volunteers, said of the new female conscripts. \u201cSome will probably be surprised and like it a lot more than they think they would.\u201d",
      "The duration of service is also being extended, from four to 11 months. Conscripts will first spend five months in basic training, followed by six months of operational service, plus additional lessons.",
      "The move is part of a broader military buildup by the Nordic nation.",
      "In February, Denmark\u2019s government announced plans to bolster its military by setting up a $7 billion fund that it said would raise the country\u2019s defense spending to more than 3% of gross domestic product this year. Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\u201cWe see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers. So, I think it\u2019s a general effort to strengthen the Danish defense,\u201d said researcher Rikke Haugegaard from the Royal Danish Defense College.",
      "But Haugegaard notes there are many challenges, from ill-fitting equipment and a lack of additional barracks, to potential cases of sexual harassment.",
      "\u201cFor the next year or two, we will be building a lot of new buildings to accommodate all these people. So, it will be a gradual process,\u201d she added.",
      "In 2017, neighboring Sweden instituted a military draft for both men and women after its government spoke of a deteriorating security environment in Europe. Norway introduced its own law applying military conscription to both sexes in 2013.",

      "BEIJING -- China has reopened its market to seafood from Japan after a nearly two-year ban over the discharge of slightly radioactive wastewater from the tsunami-destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant.",
      "A notice from the customs agency said the ban had been lifted Sunday and that imports from much of Japan would be resumed.",
      "The ban, imposed in August 2023, was a major blow to Japan's scallop and sea cucumber exporters. China was the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood, accounting for more than one-fifth of its exports. The decision to lift the ban coincides with efforts by China and Japan to improve ties as both face economic uncertainty because of the American tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The nuclear plant at Fukushima was heavily damaged by a deadly tsunami that followed a huge offshore earthquake in 2011. Water still must be pumped in to cool the radioactive fuel. The water is then stored in what was an ever-growing complex of tanks on the property.",
      "After years of debate, the utility won Japanese government permission to discharge the water gradually into the sea after treating it to remove most of the radioactive elements and diluting it with seawater. Japanese officials said the wastewater would be safer than international standards and have negligible environmental impact.",
      "China disagreed and imposed a ban, saying the discharge would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities on its east coast.",
      "Over months of talks, Japan agreed to let China take samples of the water for testing. The sampling has not found any abnormalities, the customs agency notice said",
      "China still opposes the wastewater discharge, but based on scientific evidence and analysis, it is allowing imports on a conditional basis from parts of Japan that meet China's standards, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "A ban remains in place for seafood from 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and nearby ones.",
      "Japanese seafood exporters will have to reapply for registration in China and all imports will have to include a health certificate, a certificate of compliance for radioactive substance testing and a certificate of origin, the Chinese customs agency said.",
      "Shipments to China are expected to resume gradually, Japanese government spokesperson Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo on Monday, noting the re-registration requirement.",
      "He said it was unclear how quickly scallop and sea cucumber exporters would return to China, because they had sought out other markets since the ban. But he predicted sales of sea cucumbers, a prized delicacy in China, would recover to a certain degree.",
      "Aoki said the Japanese government would continue to press for the lifting of the export ban on the other 10 prefectures.",

    "story": [
      "A jury in Australia has begun deliberations in the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A sequestered jury in Australia began deliberations Monday in the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "Three of Patterson\u2019s four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She is accused of attempting to murder the fourth, Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, who was gravely ill but survived.",
      "During the nine-week Supreme Court trial in the state of Victoria, Patterson gave evidence in her own defense. The 50-year-old mother of two faces life in prison if convicted.",
      "It isn\u2019t disputed that Patterson served her guests the toxic mushrooms or that the meal killed them. But the jury must decide whether she meant for them to die.",
      "Prosecutors in the case, which has gripped Australia for two years, said the accused woman researched, foraged and served the mushrooms deliberately and lied to investigators to cover her tracks. Their case against Patterson included that she disposed of a food dehydrator after the fatal meal and reset her phone multiple times.",
      "The prosecution said she lied about having a dire medical diagnosis to ensure her guests attended the lunch, cooked individual pastries to avoid poisoning herself, and faked symptoms to make it look as though she fell ill, too.",
      "But Patterson\u2019s lawyers said the poisoning was a terrible accident caused by a pantry mix-up of store-bought and wild mushrooms, which she didn\u2019t know were death caps. The defense case was that Patterson wasn\u2019t as ill as the other diners because she induced vomiting after the meal due to an eating disorder.",
      "The accused lied to the police that she had never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator out of panic, her lawyers said. Patterson denied telling her lunch guests she had a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.",
      "Justice Christopher Beale spent four days summarizing the case to jurors before their deliberations began, urging them not to be swayed by bias or prejudice, or by sympathy for the families of those who died. Patterson\u2019s lies, some of which she admitted during her evidence, could be used to assess her credibility but didn\u2019t mean she was guilty of murder, Justice Beale said.",
      "Prosecutors didn\u2019t offer a motive for the alleged killings and weren\u2019t required to. But they suggested a deteriorating relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, as well as her exasperation with her former in-laws, which she expressed to friends on social media months before the deaths.",
      "The defense said Erin Patterson had a positive and loving relationship with her lunch guests, who included her children\u2019s only living grandparents, and that she had no reason to kill them. Justice Beale highlighted in his summary of the case the fleeting and minor nature of the past disputes.",
      "Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal lunch but didn\u2019t go.",
      "A 14-member jury heard the case, but 12 were selected by ballot Monday to decide the verdict. The jury will remain sequestered, meaning they will stay together in court-appointed accommodation until they reach a unanimous decision.",
      "Late Monday afternoon, court staff told reporters that jurors had finished deliberations for the day and would return to consider the case Tuesday. The jury is not permitted to return a verdict outside of the court's sitting hours and members are barred from discussing the case outside the jury room \u2014 even with each other.",
      "Sequestration is rare in Australia and reflects public and media fervor about the case, with several news outlets publishing live blogs that covered every moment of the trial for its more than two-month run. The lengthy fixture in the town of Morwell, Victoria, drew lines of people eager to watch proceedings each day.",

The runner-up who had been considered a favorite \u2014 former Interior Minister Carolina Toha from the traditional Democratic Socialist party \u2014 took 27.7%.",
      "\u201cToday begins a new path that we will walk together, with the conviction to build a fairer and more democratic Chile,\u201d Jara wrote on social media. \u201cIn the face of the threat from the far-right, we respond with unity, dialogue and hope.\u201d",
      "After Boric's 2022 election, voting was made compulsory, adding unpredictability to this year\u2019s race.",
      "Preliminary turnout figures from electoral authorities showed that turnout was much lower than expected, with just 1.4 million people casting ballots. Chile has some 15.4 million eligible voters.",
      "Although Jara's landslide win represents the rise of hard-liners within Boric's coalition, analysts have described Jara as less dogmatic and more diplomatic than some of her Communist peers. As labor minister, she earned praise for a program that increased minimum wage and reduced the working week to 40 hours.",
      "She has earned comparisons to Michelle Bachelet, Chile's former center-left president and an icon of female empowerment who governed 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018.",
      "Paying tribute to Bachelet in her victory speech, she said: \u201cShe was the one who showed us the path that nothing is impossible.\u201d",
      "But Jara faces a tough climb to the top job. Recent opinion polls show the left-wing government declining in popularity at a moment of sluggish economic growth and rising fears over organized crime and migration in what has long been regarded as one of the region\u2019s most stable and prosperous democracies.",
      "Those hot-button issues have helped mobilize support for Chile's right-wing candidates, particularly ultraconservative lawyer and former lawmaker Jose Antonio Kast, and set the stage for a deeply polarized election.",
      "Another favorite on the right is Evelyn Matthei, a former minister of labor whose business friendly policy proposals have charmed investors.",
      "Chileans will go to the polls Nov. 16 to elect a president for the 2026-2030 term.",

      "The power of celebrity is the one trend that defined the fashion season in Paris",
      "PARIS -- If any force swept through the fashion industry this season \u2014 and sent shockwaves around the globe \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a new silhouette or a daring color. It was the spectacle of celebrity.",
      "Star power eclipsed fabric and form, transforming the runways of Paris Fashion Week into arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols, and digital megastars didn\u2019t just attend \u2014 they became the main event.",
      "As the week wraps up Sunday, it\u2019s clear: the world is watching not for what\u2019s worn, but for who\u2019s wearing it.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z didn\u2019t just attend Louis Vuitton\u2019s blockbuster show \u2014 they became the story. As they swept into the Pompidou Center, the entire mood shifted. Cameras flashed. Phones shot skyward. Even before the first look hit the runway, images of the couple rocketed around the globe.",
      "The scene encapsulated a truth that every major brand \u2014 from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Herm\u00e8s to Saint Laurent \u2014 now understands: The real front row isn\u2019t in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s head-to-toe denim look \u2014 a custom Louis Vuitton creation by Pharrell Williams \u2014 sparked headlines worldwide and instantly set the tone for the season. Her ensemble, complete with a cowboy hat and Western belt, became one of the most shared images of fashion week, underlining just how quickly a star\u2019s wardrobe can ignite trends far beyond the runway.",
      "Her Cowboy Carter tour, however, hasn't been without controversy \u2014 a T-shirt worn in Paris referencing Buffalo Soldiers drew criticism online this week from some Indigenous and Mexican communities.",
      "And when Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway, the moment went viral \u2014 striking a powerful note that Beyonc\u00e9 isn't just an attendee, but the face of Louis Vuitton\u2019s creative vision.",
      "This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it.",
      "It\u2019s a story that\u2019s been told before \u2014 celebrity eclipsing fashion \u2014 but in a year of global uncertainty, the urge for escapism and the power of star-driven fantasy have reached a new intensity.",
      "What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event.",
      "Designers don\u2019t just stage shows \u2014 they produce spectacles.",
      "Williams, Louis Vuitton\u2019s showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames. Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories \u2014 making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself.",
      "The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears.",
      "No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7\u2019s Bambam, and NCT\u2019s Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo.",
      "These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale.",
      "Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d moment and Louis Vuitton\u2019s nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends \u2014 knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks.",
      "\u201cWe make fashion, but we\u2019re a house of travel,\u201d Williams told reporters. In truth, it\u2019s the celebrity\u2019s journey through fashion that matters most.",
      "The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim.",
      "TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Herm\u00e8s, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance. Their posts quickly turn exclusive details into mass-market \u201cmust-haves.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a process that global platforms like Shein and Temu have weaponized \u2014 transforming a viral runway or celebrity moment into affordable, shoppable trends in a matter of days. The result: What debuts on the Paris catwalk can show up in online shopping carts from Atlanta to Addis Ababa almost instantly.",
      "Beneath the celebrity glow, classic trends endure. Streetwear is still king, with oversized silhouettes, soft tailoring and activewear influences everywhere from Dior to Dolce & Gabbana.",
      "The Herm\u00e8s \u201ccool city guy\u201d and Dolce\u2019s pajama dressing \u2014 rumpled but rich \u2014 are direct answers to how men want to live and move now. But even these trends go mainstream through star power, not just design. The models might debut the look, but it\u2019s the front-row faces who make it stick.",
      "Williams\u2019 very appointment as Louis Vuitton\u2019s menswear creative director \u2014 a chart-topping musician handpicked by LVMH chief Bernard Arnault in 2023 \u2014 was itself a statement: In today\u2019s industry, celebrity doesn\u2019t just influence fashion, it leads it.",
      "All this spectacle reflects a bigger shift. Fashion isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in \u2014 it\u2019s about who\u2019s in the room, and who\u2019s watching. At Armani in Milan, at Saint Laurent in Paris, at every show, a galaxy of K-pop, Hollywood, and music stars now drive the narrative.",
      "For Gen Z and Alpha, the runway is no longer about aspiration \u2014 it\u2019s about participation, sharing, and living in the moment. The \u201cshow\u201d has become the product.",
      "In 2025, the biggest trend in men\u2019s fashion isn\u2019t a garment at all \u2014 it\u2019s the show itself. And in a season defined by heat, hype and headlines, it\u2019s clear: celebrity is the new couture, and we\u2019re all in the front row.",

      "Pope Leo XIV is marking a feast day as the Vatican launches a new campaign to boost donations from the faithful",
      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV on Sunday celebrated a special feast day traditionally used by the Catholic Church to drum up donations from the faithful, with the Vatican under the first American pope rolling out a new campaign to urge ordinary Catholics to help bail out the deficit-ridden Holy See.",
      "Leo celebrated Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, marking the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul and repeated his message calling for unity and communion among all Christians.",
      "In churches around the world, Masses on the July 29 feast day often include a special collection for Peter\u2019s Pence, a fund which both underwrites the operations of the central government of the Catholic Church and pays for the pope\u2019s personal acts of charity.",
      "With a promotional video, poster, QR code and website soliciting donations via credit card, PayPal, bank transfer and post office transfer, the Vatican is betting this year that an American-style fundraising pitch under the Chicago-born Leo will help keep the Holy See bureaucracy afloat and erase its 50 million to 60 million euro ($57-68 million) structural deficit.",
      "The video features footage of Leo\u2019s emotional first moments as pope, when he stepped out onto the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and later choked up as he received the fisherman\u2019s ring of the papacy. With an evocative soundtrack in the background, the video superimposes a message, available in several languages, urging donations to Leo via the Peter\u2019s Pence collection.",
      "\u201cWith your donation to Peter\u2019s Pence, you support the steps of the Holy Father,\u201d it says. \u201cHelp him proclaim the Gospel to the world and extend a hand to our brothers and sisters in need. Support the steps of Pope Leo XIV. Donate to Peter\u2019s Pence.\u201d",
      "The fund has been the source of scandal in recent years, amid revelations that the Vatican's secretariat of state mismanaged its holdings through bad investments, incompetent management and waste. The recent trial over the Vatican\u2019s bungled investment in a London property confirmed that the vast majority of Peter\u2019s Pence contributions had funded the Holy See\u2019s budgetary shortfalls, not papal charity initiatives as many parishioners had been led to believe.",
      "Between the revelations and the COVID-19 pandemic, which closed churches and canceled out the traditional pass-the-basket collection on June 29, Peter\u2019s Pence donations fell to 43.5 million euros in 2022 \u2014 a low not seen since 1986 \u2014 that was nevertheless offset the same year by other investment income and revenue to the fund.",
      "Donations rose to 48.4 million euros (about $56.7 million) in 2023 and hit 54.3 million euros (nearly $63.6 million) last year, according to the Peter\u2019s Pence annual report issued last week. But the fund incurred expenses of 75.4 million euros ($88.3 million) in 2024, continuing the trend in which the fund is exhausting itself as it covers the Holy See\u2019s budgetary shortfalls.",
      "On top of the budget deficit, the Vatican is also facing a 1 billion euro (about $1.17 billion) shortfall in its pension fund that Pope Francis, in the months before he died, warned was unable in the medium term to fulfill its obligations.",
      "Unlike countries, the Holy See doesn't issue bonds or impose income tax on its residents to run its operations, relying instead on donations, investments and revenue generated by the Vatican Museums, and sales of stamps, coins, publications and other initiatives.",
      "For years, the United States has been the greatest source of donations to Peter\u2019s Pence, with U.S. Catholics contributing around a quarter of the total each year.",
      "Vatican officials are hoping that under Leo\u2019s pontificate, with new financial controls in place and an American math major running the Holy See, donors will be reassured that their money won\u2019t be misspent or mismanaged.",
      "\u201cThis is a concrete way to support the Holy Father in his mission of service to the universal Church,\u201d the Vatican\u2019s economy ministry said in a press release last week announcing the annual collection and new promotional materials surrounding it. \u201cPeter\u2019s Pence is a gesture of communion and participation in the Pope\u2019s mission to proclaim the Gospel, promote peace, and spread Christian charity.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- After a weekend of setbacks, the Senate will try to sprint ahead Monday on President Donald Trump's big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts despite a series of challenges, including the sudden announcement from one GOP senator that he won't run for reelection after opposing the package over its Medicaid health care cuts.",
      "An all-night session to consider an endless stream of proposed amendments to the package, in what's called a vote-a-rama, was abruptly postponed, and it's now scheduled to launch as soon as the Senate gavels open. With Democrats united against the Republican president's legislation and eagerly lined up to challenge it, the voting could take all day.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the \u201chardest choices\" for Republicans are still to come. His side plans to bring \u201camendment after amendment after amendment to the floor, so Republicans can defend their billionaire tax cuts and so they can try to explain their massive cuts to Medicaid to people back home.\u201d",
      "The hours ahead will be pivotal for the Republicans, who have control of the Congress and are racing against Trump's Fourth of July deadline to wrap up work. The 940-page \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d as it is now formally titled, has consumed the Congress as its shared priority with the president, with no room politically to fail, even as not all Republicans are on board.",
      "A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law. It also said the package would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the decade.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's leadership team has recalled lawmakers back to Washington for voting in the House as soon as Wednesday, if the legislation can first clear the Senate.",
      "But the outcome remains uncertain, especially after a weekend of work in the Senate that brought less visible progress on securing enough Republican support, over Democratic opposition, for passage.",
      "Few Republicans appear fully satisfied as the final package emerges. GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who announced Sunday he would not seek reelection after Trump badgered him over his opposition to the package, said he has the same goals as Trump, cutting taxes and spending.",

But some were found to be out of compliance with the rules by the Senate parliamentarian.",
      "All told, the Senate bill includes some $4 trillion in tax cuts, making permanent Trump's 2017 rates, which would expire at the end of the year if Congress fails to act, while adding the new ones he campaigned on, including no taxes on tips.",
      "The Senate package would roll back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits that Democrats warn will wipe out wind and solar investments nationwide and impose $1.2 trillion in cuts, largely to Medicaid and food stamps, by imposing work requirements, making sign-up eligibility more stringent and changing federal reimbursements to states.",
      "Additionally, the bill would provide a $350 billion infusion for border and national security, including for deportations, some of it paid for with new fees charged to immigrants.",
      "Unable to stop the march toward passage, the Democrats as the minority party in Congress are using the tools at their disposal to delay and drag out the process.",
      "Democrats forced a full reading of the text, which took 16 hours. Then Democratic senators took over Sunday's debate, filling the chamber with speeches, while Republicans largely stood aside.",
      "\u201cReckless and irresponsible,\" said Sen. Gary Peters, a Democrat from Michigan.",

Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\u201cWe see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers.

      "Those critical of the city's political changes say it\u2019s a less visible side of a push to silence dissent that began five years ago when Beijing imposed a national security law to crush challenges to its rule, under which opposition politicians were jailed and pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily was shuttered.",
      "China said the law was necessary for the city's stability following anti-government protests in 2019.",

A school where she taught sociology part-time asked her to leave after it received a letter claiming that she made a student uncomfortable.",
      "The letter, which was written in the simplified Chinese characters used in mainland China but less prominently in Hong Kong, included links to news reports about her arrest under the homegrown national security law last year, though she was never charged.",

      "A notice from the customs agency said the ban had been lifted Sunday and that imports from much of Japan would be resumed.",
      "The ban, imposed in August 2023, was a major blow to Japan's scallop and sea cucumber exporters. China was the biggest overseas market for Japanese seafood, accounting for more than one-fifth of its exports. The decision to lift the ban coincides with efforts by China and Japan to improve ties as both face economic uncertainty because of the American tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The nuclear plant at Fukushima was heavily damaged by a deadly tsunami that followed a huge offshore earthquake in 2011. Water still must be pumped in to cool the radioactive fuel. The water is then stored in what was an ever-growing complex of tanks on the property.",
      "After years of debate, the utility won Japanese government permission to discharge the water gradually into the sea after treating it to remove most of the radioactive elements and diluting it with seawater. Japanese officials said the wastewater would be safer than international standards and have negligible environmental impact.",
      "China disagreed and imposed a ban, saying the discharge would endanger the fishing industry and coastal communities on its east coast.",
      "Over months of talks, Japan agreed to let China take samples of the water for testing. The sampling has not found any abnormalities, the customs agency notice said",
      "China still opposes the wastewater discharge, but based on scientific evidence and analysis, it is allowing imports on a conditional basis from parts of Japan that meet China's standards, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said.",
      "A ban remains in place for seafood from 10 of Japan's 47 prefectures, including Fukushima and nearby ones.",
      "Japanese seafood exporters will have to reapply for registration in China and all imports will have to include a health certificate, a certificate of compliance for radioactive substance testing and a certificate of origin, the Chinese customs agency said.",
      "Shipments to China are expected to resume gradually, Japanese government spokesperson Kazuhiko Aoki told reporters in Tokyo on Monday, noting the re-registration requirement.",
      "He said it was unclear how quickly scallop and sea cucumber exporters would return to China, because they had sought out other markets since the ban. But he predicted sales of sea cucumbers, a prized delicacy in China, would recover to a certain degree.",
      "Aoki said the Japanese government would continue to press for the lifting of the export ban on the other 10 prefectures.",

      "Carney and Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney\u2019s office said they agreed to resume negotiations.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month\u2019s G7 Leaders\u2019 Summit in Kananaskis,\u201d Carney said in a statement.",
      "Carney visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but firm. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.",
      "Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.",
      "The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a \u201cclear victory\" for Trump.",
      "\"At some point this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "He said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump\u2019s outbursts.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executive will be very happy with this outcome,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday.",
      "\u201cRescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,\u201d Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.",
      "Trump\u2019s announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he\u2019s launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the U.S. president poking at the nation\u2019s northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.",
      "Canada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Trump imposed on goods from America\u2019s neighbor.",
      "Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period he set would expire.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Trump\u2019s first term.",

      "The changes made to President Donald Trump\u2019s big tax bill in the Senate would pile trillions onto the nation\u2019s debt load while resulting in even steeper losses in health care coverage, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new analysis,...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The changes made to President Donald Trump's big tax bill in the Senate would pile trillions onto the nation's debt load while resulting in even steeper losses in health care coverage, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in a new analysis, adding to the challenges for Republicans as they try to muscle the bill to passage.",
      "The CBO estimates the Senate bill would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, a nearly $1 trillion increase over the House-passed bill, which CBO has projected would add $2.4 to the debt over a decade.",
      "The analysis also found that 11.8 million more Americans would become uninsured by 2034 if the bill became law, an increase over the scoring for the House-passed version of the bill, which predicts 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage.",
      "The stark numbers are yet another obstacle for Republican leaders as they labor to pass Trump's bill by his self-imposed July 4th deadline.",
      "Even before the CBO's estimate, Republicans were at odds over the contours of the legislation, with some resisting the cost-saving proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid and food aid programs even as other Republicans say those proposals don't go far enough. Republicans are slashing the programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks put in place during his first term.",
      "The push-pull was on vivid display Saturday night as a routine procedural vote to take up the legislation in the Senate was held open for hours as Vice President JD Vance and Republican leaders met with several holdouts. The bill ultimately advanced in a 51-49 vote, but the path ahead is fraught, with voting on amendments still to come.",
      "Still, many Republicans are disputing the CBO estimates and the reliability of the office's work. To hoist the bill to passage, they are using a different budget baseline that assumes the Trump tax cuts expiring in December have already been extended, essentially making them cost-free in the budget.",
      "The CBO on Saturday released a separate analysis of the GOP's preferred approach that found the Senate bill would reduce deficits by about $500 billion.",
      "Democrats and economists decry the GOP's approach as \u201cmagic math\u201d that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks.",
      "In addition, Democrats note that under the traditional scoring system, the Republican bill bill would violate the Senate's \u201cByrd Rule\u201d that forbids the legislation from increasing deficits after 10 years.",
      "In a Sunday letter to Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, CBO Director Phillip Swagel said the office estimates that the Finance Committee\u2019s portion of the bill, also known as Title VII, \u201cincreases the deficits in years after 2034\u201d under traditional scoring.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is not planning to extend a 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9, when the negotiating period he set would expire, and his administration will notify countries that the trade penalties will take effect unless there are deals with the United States.",
      "Letters will start going out \u201cpretty soon\" before the approaching deadline, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll look at how a country treats us \u2014 are they good, are they not so good \u2014 some countries we don\u2019t care, we\u2019ll just send a high number out,\u201d Trump told Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures\" during a wide-ranging interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday.",
      "Those letters, he said, would say, \u201cCongratulations, we\u2019re allowing you to shop in the United States of America, you\u2019re going to pay a 25% tariff, or a 35% or a 50% or 10%.\u201d",
      "Trump had played down the deadline at a White House news conference Friday by noting how difficult it would be to work out separate deals with each nation. The administration had set a goal of reaching 90 trade deals in 90 days.",
      "Negotiations continue, but \u201cthere's 200 countries, you can't talk to all of them,\u201d he said in the interview.",
      "Trump also discussed a potential TikTok deal, relations with China, the strikes on Iran and his immigration crackdown.",
      "Here are the key takeaways:",
      "A group of wealthy investors will make an offer to buy TikTok, Trump said, hinting at a deal that could safeguard the future of the popular social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance.",
      "\u201cWe have a buyer for TikTok, by the way. I think I\u2019ll need, probably, China approval, and I think President Xi (Jinping) will probably do it,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump did not offer any details about the investors, calling them \u201ca group of very wealthy people.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'll tell you in about two weeks,\u201d he said when asked for specifics.",
      "It's a time frame Trump often cites, most recently about a decision on whether the U.S. military would get directly involved in the war between Israel and Iran. The U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites just days later.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to keep TikTok running in the U.S. for 90 more days to give his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.",
      "It is the third time Trump extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban \u2014 approved by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court \u2014 took effect.",
      "U.S. strikes on Iran \u201cobliterated\u201d its nuclear facilities, Trump insisted, and he said whoever leaked a preliminary intelligence assessment suggesting Tehran's nuclear program had been set back only a few months should be prosecuted.",
      "Trump said Iran was \u201cweeks away\u201d from achieving a nuclear weapon before he ordered the strikes.",
      "\u201cIt was obliterated like nobody\u2019s ever seen before,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Sunday on X that Trump \"exaggerated to cover up and conceal the truth.\" Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, Amir Saeid Iravani, told CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his country's nuclear program is peaceful and that uranium \u201cenrichment is our right, and an inalienable right and we want to implement this right\u201d under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \u201cI think that enrichment will not \u2014 never stop.\u201d",
      "Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said on CBS that \u201cit is clear that there has been severe damage, but it\u2019s not total damage.\"",
      "Grossi also said the U.N. nuclear watchdog has faced pressure to report that Iran had a nuclear weapon or was close to one, but \u201cwe simply didn\u2019t because this was not what we were seeing.\u201d",
      "Of the leak of the intelligence assessment, Trump said anyone found to be responsible should be prosecuted. Journalists who received it should be asked who their source was, he said: \u201cYou have to do that and I suspect we\u2019ll be doing things like that.\u201d",
      "His press secretary said Thursday that the administration is investigating the matter.",
      "As he played up his immigration crackdown, Trump offered a more nuanced view when it comes to farm and hotel workers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the strongest immigration guy that there\u2019s ever been, but I\u2019m also the strongest farmer guy that there\u2019s ever been,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "He noted that he wants to deport criminals, but it\u2019s a problem when farmers lose their laborers and it destroys their businesses.",
      "Trump said his administration is working on \u201csome kind of a temporary pass\u201d that could give farmers and hotel owners control over immigration raids at their facilities.",
      "Earlier this month, Trump had called for a pause on immigration raids disrupting the farming, hotel and restaurant industries, but a top Homeland Security official followed up with a seemingly contradictory statement. Tricia McLaughlin said there would be \u201cno safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine\u201d immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "Trump praised a recent trade deal with Beijing over rare earth exports from China and said establishing a fairer relationship will require significant tariffs.",
      "\u201cI think getting along well with China is a very good thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cChina\u2019s going to be paying a lot of tariffs, but we have a big (trade) deficit, they understand that.\"",
      "Trump said he would be open to removing sanctions on Iranian oil shipments to China if Iran can show \u201cthey can be peaceful and if they can show us they're not going to do any more harm.\u201d",
      "But the president also indicated the U.S. isn\u2019t afraid to retaliate against Beijing. When Fox News Channel host Maria Bartiromo noted that China has tried to hack U.S. systems and steal intellectual property, Trump replied, \u201cYou don\u2019t think we do that to them?\u201d",

      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d debuted with $55.6 million in North American theaters and $144 million globally over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, handing the tech company easily its biggest opening yet.",
      "Though Apple Original Films has had some notable successes in its six years in Hollywood \u2014 including the 2021 Oscar-winner \u201cCODA\u201d \u2014 its theatrical results have been decidedly mixed. Misfires like \u201cArgylle\u201d and \u201cFly Me to the Moon\u201d and big-budget awards plays like Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cNapoleon\u201d and Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d have been better at driving viewers to Apple TV+ than movie theaters.",
      "But \u201cF1\u201d was Apple\u2019s first foray into summer blockbuster territory. It won a bidding war for the project from much of the production team behind the 2022 box-office smash \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d Apple then partnered with Warner Bros. to distributed the film starring Brad Pitt, Damson Idris and Kerry Condon.",
      "With a production budget over $200 million, \u201cF1\u201d still has several laps to go to turn a profit. But for now, \u201cF1\u201d is full speed ahead.",
      "\"The film\u2019s outstanding debut reflects both the excitement of Formula 1 and the deeply emotional and entertaining story crafted by the entire cast and creative team,\" said Zack Van Amburg, who heads worldwide video for Apple with Jamie Erlicht. \"Their dedication and innovation have fueled an unforgettable cinematic experience.\u201d",
      "Car racing movies have often struggled in theaters; crash-and-burn cases include Ron Howard\u2019s \u201cRush\u201d (2013) and Michael Mann\u2019s \u201cFerrari\u201d (2023). But \u201cF1\u201d built off the Formula 1 fandom stirred up by the popular series \u201cFormula 1: Drive to Survive.\u201d And it leaned on \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d director Joseph Kosinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to deliver another adult-oriented action thrill ride.",
      "As in \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d the filmmakers sought an adrenaline rush by placing IMAX cameras inside the cockpit in \u201cF1.\u201d IMAX and large-format screens accounted for 55% of in its ticket sales. IMAX, whose screens are much sought-after in the summer, has carved out a three-week run for the movie.",
      "Warner Bros. expected \u201cF1\u201d to perform well overseas, where the sport is more popular than it is in the U.S. Jeffrey Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros., said Pitt was the movie's \u201csecret sauce.\u201d The $144 million global launch is the actor's biggest opening weekend.",
      "\u201cWe came up with multiple campaigns based on where you are in the world,\u201d said Goldstein. \u201cWe planned for an audience-winner: screen the movie and get it out there. People talking about this movie drove this movie.\u201d",
      "Reviews have been very good for \u201cF1\u201d and audience reaction (an \u201cA\u201d via CinemaScore) was even better. That suggests \u201cF1\u201d could hold up well in the coming weeks despite some formidable coming competition in Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cJurassic World Rebirth.\u201d",
      "Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, praised Warner Bros. for making \u201cF1\u201d a theatrical event. The studio was also behind the year's other big original release, \u201cSinners.\"",
      "\u201cFor Apple, this demonstrates to them the prestige factor of having a big theatrical release,\" said Dergarabedian. \u201cIt elevates their brand.\"",

      "The power of celebrity is the one trend that defined the fashion season in Paris",
      "PARIS -- If any force dominated the global fashion industry this season \u2014 eclipsing fabric, form and even the wildest silhouettes \u2014 it was the spectacle of celebrity.",
      "In a year marked by global anxiety and a hunger for fantasy, star power flooded Paris Fashion Week, turning runways into gladiator arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols and digital megastars became the main event.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z didn\u2019t just attend Louis Vuitton\u2019s blockbuster show \u2014 they became the show.",
      "As they swept into the Pompidou Center, cameras flashed and phones shot skyward. Before the first look even hit the runway, images of the couple ricocheted across the globe. K-pop idols like J-Hope and Jackson Wang livestreamed their arrival to millions, while crowds outside flooded social feeds with every glimpse of a star.",
      "As the industry\u2019s spring season wraps up Sunday, it\u2019s clear: Fashion\u2019s global audience is focused less on what\u2019s worn and more on who\u2019s wearing it.",
      "This interplay between celebrity and fashion is hardly new, but in 2025, the desire for escapism and star-driven spectacle is peaking like never before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about celebrity clickbait, and it\u2019s at a tipping point now. Celebrities have replaced the designers and stylists as the tastemakers,\u201d said Anna Barr, a fashion magazine editor who attended shows.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's appearance this week encapsulated a truth that every major brand \u2014 from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Herm\u00e8s to Saint Laurent \u2014 now understands: The real front row isn\u2019t in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star.",
      "The pop star\u2019s head-to-toe denim \u2014 custom Louis Vuitton by Pharrell Williams \u2014 wasn\u2019t just viral.",
      "Within 24 hours, clips of her arrival amassed millions of views on TikTok, outpacing even Louis Vuitton\u2019s own campaign content. When Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway in the Paris dusk, the moment went viral \u2014 underlining that Beyonc\u00e9 isn\u2019t just an attendee, but a face of Louis Vuitton\u2019s creative vision.",
      "But even as Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s look became the week\u2019s most shared image, her presence in Paris also sparked debate: a Buffalo Soldiers T-shirt she wore during her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour ignited criticism from some Indigenous and Mexican communities, reminding the industry that every viral moment can be a flash point.",
      "This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it.",
      "What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event.",
      "Designers don\u2019t just stage shows \u2014 they produce spectacles. Williams, Louis Vuitton\u2019s showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames.",
      "Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories \u2014 making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself.",
      "The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears.",
      "No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7\u2019s Bambam, and NCT\u2019s Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo.",
      "These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale.",
      "Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201c Cowboy Carter \u201d moment and Louis Vuitton\u2019s nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends \u2014 knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks.",
      "\u201cWe make fashion, but we\u2019re a house of travel,\u201d Williams told reporters. In truth, it\u2019s the celebrity\u2019s journey through fashion that matters most.",
      "The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim.",
      "TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Herm\u00e8s, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance.

But even these trends go mainstream through star power, not just design. The models might debut the look, but it\u2019s the front-row faces who make it stick.",
      "The celebrity ascendancy isn\u2019t just a front-row phenomenon \u2014 it\u2019s woven into the industry itself.

It was a declaration that celebrity now runs the show.",

      "Buffett said late Friday that the shares of Berkshire Hathaway will be delivered on Monday. Berkshire Hathaway owns Geico, Dairy Queen and a range of other businesses, and Buffett is donating nearly 12.4 million of the Class B shares of its stock. Those shares have a lower and easier-to-digest price tag than the company's original Class A shares, and each of the B shares was worth $485.68 at their most recent close on Friday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.",
      "Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July.",
      "Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.",
      "Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.",
      "Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.",
      "It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount.",
      "A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years.",
      "There are scores of business-related tax cuts.",
      "The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.",
      "Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.",
      "The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.",
      "Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year.",
      "The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.",
      "For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.",
      "To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.",
      "Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.",
      "The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program\u2019s work requirements.",
      "There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services.",
      "Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts.",
      "All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.",
      "The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Fund to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.",
      "Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.",
      "In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings.",
      "A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.",
      "The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.",
      "The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump\u2019s long-sought \u201cNational Garden of American Heroes.\u201d",
      "There's a new excise tax on university endowments, restrictions on the development of artificial intelligence and blocks on transgender surgeries. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee.",
      "Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.",
      "The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.",
      "Also, the interior secretary would be directed to sell certain Bureau of Land Management acreage to provide for housing. The sale of public lands would cover at least 600,000 acres and up to 1.2 million acres, according to a projection from the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.",
      "Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.",
      "The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to grind through a rare weekend session as Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks and spending cuts by his July Fourth deadline.",
      "Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks.",
      "The 940-page bill was released shortly before midnight Friday. Senators were expected to take a procedural vote Saturday to begin debate on the legislation, but the timing was uncertain and there is a long path ahead, with at least 10 hours of debate time and an all-night voting session on countless amendments.",
      "Senate passage could be days away, and the bill would need to return to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.",
      "\u201cIt's evolving,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., as he prepared to close up the chamber late Friday.",
      "The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up, even as he sometimes gives mixed signals, allowing for more time.",
      "At recent events at the White House, including Friday, Trump has admonished the \u201cgrandstanders\u201d among GOP holdouts to fall in line.",
      "\u201cWe can get it done,\u201d Trump said in a social media post. \u201cIt will be a wonderful Celebration for our Country.\u201d",
      "The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda.",
      "But the spending cuts that Republicans are relying on to offset the lost tax revenues are causing dissent within the GOP ranks. Some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he is concerned about the fundamentals of the package and will not support the procedural motion to begin debate.",
      "\u201cI'm voting no on the motion to proceed,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., pushing for deeper cuts, said he needed to see the final legislative text.",
      "The release of that draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the bill to ensure it complied with the chamber\u2019s strict \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump\u2019s bill.",
      "Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals were determined to be out of compliance by the chief arbiter of the Senate's rules. One plan would have shifted some food stamp costs from the federal government to the states; a second would have gutted the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.",
      "The final text includes a proposal for cuts to a Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary objections and opposition from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers.",
      "Most states impose the provider tax as a way to boost federal Medicaid reimbursements. Some Republicans argue that is a scam and should be abolished.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The CBO has not yet publicly assessed the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.",
      "Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the poorest Americans would face a $1,600 tax increase, the CBO said.",
      "One unresolved issue remains the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states. The cap is now $10,000.",
      "The White House and House Republicans had narrowed in on a plan for a $40,000 cap, but for five years instead of 10. Republican senators says that's too generous. At least one House GOP holdout, Rep. Nick LaLota of New York, said he cannot support the compromise.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what\u2019s in it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no good reason for Republicans to chase a silly deadline,\u201d Schumer said.",

      "It\u2019s been illegal to smoke in restaurants, bars and public buildings since a series of bans in 2007 and 2008. Ever-higher taxes mean a pack now costs upwards of 12 euros ($14).",
      "Yet more than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, most of them daily, one of the higher rates in Europe and globally. The Health Ministry is particularly concerned that tobacco remains popular among young people, citing public health statistics showing that 15% of 17-year-olds smoke. Black market cigarette trading is common.",
      "More than 200 people in France die each day of tobacco-related illness, Health Minister Catherine Vautrin said in a statement Saturday. That adds up to some 75,000 deaths per year.",
      "In a Paris park as the ban loomed, views were mixed.",
      "Parisian Natacha Uzan welcomed the end of smoking in restaurants. But she said: \u2019\u2019Now outside, in parks, I find it becoming a bit repressive.\u201d",
      "The broader ban is a \u2018\u2019good thing'' for Anabelle Cermell, mother of a 3-month-old boy. \u2018\u2019I tell myself, oh, it\u2019s really not ideal for him, but there\u2019s not much I can do about it, or I would have to ... not take the bus, not go to parks.\u201d",
      "The government said last month that the new ban would take effect July 1. The official decree introducing the ban was published Saturday, and a health minister\u2019s statement said that a government order specifying the perimeters set by the ban would be published in the coming days.",
      "Electronic cigarettes are exempt from the new ban.",
      "Other European countries have gone farther. Britain and Sweden have tightened smoking regulations in public spaces. Spain is extending its smoking ban to caf\u00e9 and restaurant terraces, which are exempt from France\u2019s new ban.",

      "Prosecutors began investigating in 2021 whether Juventus, which is listed on the Milan stock exchange, cashed in on illegal commissions from transfer and loans of players. The case has also explored whether investors were misled with invoices being issued for non-existent transactions to demonstrate income that in turn could be deemed false accounting.",
      "A decision in the case, which was moved from Turin to Rome, is expected in September, a preliminary judge announced Friday.",
      "The case prompted Agnelli and Juventus\u2019 entire board of directors to resign in 2022. Agnelli was then given two separate bans by sports authorities, the last of which expires in October.",
      "Juventus was hit with a 10-point penalty in the 2022-23 season and then removed by UEFA from the Conference League for financial irregularities.",
      "If the plea bargains are accepted in September, it could be the final step in the false accounting legal cases at Juventus and set up Agnelli's possible return to soccer after his sports ban expires a month later.",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation that provides public funding to renovate Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",
      "Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "Brazil\u2019s Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office has signed a landmark agreement with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to limit the use of its satellite internet service in illegal mining and other criminal operations in the Amazon",
      "Brasilia, BRAZIL -- Brazil\u2019s Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced Friday a deal with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to curb the use of its services in illegal mining and other criminal activities in the Amazon.",
      "Starlink\u2019s lightweight, high-speed internet system has rapidly spread across the Amazon, a region that for decades struggled with slow and unreliable connectivity. But the service has also been adopted by criminal organizations, which have used it to coordinate logistics, make payments and receive alerts about police raids.",
      "It's the first agreement of its kind aimed at curbing such use following years of pressure from Brazilian authorities.",
      "Starlink, a division of Musk's SpaceX, will begin requiring identification and proof of residence from all new users in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region starting in January. The company will also provide Brazilian authorities with user registration and geolocation data for internet units located in areas under investigation.",
      "If a terminal is confirmed to be used for illegal activity, Starlink has committed to blocking the service. The deal is for two years and can be renewed.",
      "Illegal gold mining has contaminated hundreds of miles of Amazon rivers with mercury and disrupted the traditional lives of several Indigenous tribes, including the Yanomami. Starlink, which first arrived in the region in 2022, has enabled criminal groups to manage mining operations in remote areas, where logistics are complex and equipment and fuel must be transported by small plane or boat.",
      "\u201cThe use of satellite internet has transformed the logistics of illegal mining. This new reality demands a proportional legal response. With the agreement, connectivity in remote areas also becomes a tool for environmental responsibility and respect for sovereignty,\u201d federal prosecutor Andr\u00e9 Porreca said in a statement.",
      "Illegal gold miners and loggers have always had some form of communication, mainly via radio, to evade law enforcement. Starlink, with its fast and mobile internet, has significantly enhanced that capability, Hugo Loss, operations coordinator for Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, told The Associated Press in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to transmit in real time the locations of enforcement teams, allowing them to anticipate our arrival, which seriously compromises the safety of our personnel and undermines the effectiveness of operations,\u201d Loss said. \u201cCutting the signal in mining areas, especially on Indigenous lands and in protected areas, is essential because internet access in these locations serves only criminal purposes.\u201d",
      "Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection for the agency, said what\u2019s also needed is tighter regulation on the sale and use of such equipment.",
      "The AP emailed James Gleeson, SpaceX\u2019s vice president of communications, with questions about the deal, but didn't immediately receive a response.",

      "The U.S. and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The United States and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions. But details are scarce, and the latest pact leaves major issues between the world's two biggest economies unresolved.",
      "President Donald Trump said late Thursday that a deal with China had been signed \"the other day.'' China's Commerce Ministry confirmed Friday that some type of arrangement had been reached but offered few details about it.",
      "Sudden shifts and a lack of clarity have been hallmarks of Trump's trade policy since he returned to the White House determined to overturn a global trading system that he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "He's been engaged for months in a battle with China that has mostly revealed how much pain the two countries can inflict on each other. And he's racing against a July 8 deadline to reach deals with other major U.S. trading partners.",
      "The uncertainty over his dealmaking and the cost of the tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers and usually passed on to consumers, have raised worries about the outlook for the U.S. economy. And although analysts welcomed the apparent easing of tensions with China, they also warned that the issues dividing Washington and Beijing are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday that the Chinese had agreed to make it easier for American firms to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals critical for manufacturing and microchip production. Beijing had slowed exports of the materials amid a bitter trade dispute with the Trump administration.",
      "Without explicitly mentioning U.S. access to rare earths, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that \u201cChina will, in accordance with the law, review and approve eligible export applications for controlled items. In turn, the United States will lift a series of restrictive measures it had imposed on China.''",
      "The Chinese have complained about U.S. controls on exports of advanced U.S. technology to China. But the ministry statement did not specifically say whether the United States planned to ease or lift those controls.",
      "In his interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d Bessent mentioned that the United States had earlier imposed \u201ccountermeasures'' against China and \u201dhad held back some vital supplies for them.''",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing here is a de-escalation under President Trump\u2019s leadership,'' Bessent said, without spelling out what concessions the United States had made or whether they involved America's export controls.",
      "Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy, wondered why Trump hadn\u2019t disclosed details of the agreement two days after it had been reached.",
      "\u201cSilence regarding the terms suggests that there is less substance to the deal than the Trump Administration implies,\u2033 said Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China.",
      "The agreement that emerged Thursday and Friday builds on a \"framework'' that Trump announced June 11 after two days of high-level U.S.-China talks in London. Then, he announced, China had agreed to ease restrictions on rare earths. In return, the United States said it would stop seeking to revoke the visas of Chinese students on U.S. college campuses.",
      "And last month, after another meeting in Geneva, the two countries had agreed to dramatically reduce massive taxes they'd slapped on each other's products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.",
      "Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In Geneva, the two countries agreed to back off and keep talking: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%. That led to the talks in London earlier this month and to this week's announcement.",
      "If nothing else, the two countries are trying to ratchet down tensions after demonstrating how much they can hurt each other.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and China appear to be easing the chokeholds they had on each other\u2019s economies through export controls on computer chips and rare earth minerals, respectively,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"This is a positive step but a far cry from signaling prospects of a substantial de-escalation of tariffs and other trade hostilities.''",
      "Trump launched a trade war with China in his first term, imposing tariffs on most Chinese goods in a dispute over China's attempts to supplant U.S. technological supremacy. Trump's trade team charged that China was unfairly subsidizing its own tech companies, forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market and even engaging outright theft of trade secrets.",
      "The squabbling and negotiating of the past few months appear to have done little to resolve Washington's complaints about unfair Chinese trade practices and America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $262 billion last year.",
      "This week's agreement \u201cincludes absolutely nothing related to the U.S.\u2019s concerns regarding China\u2019s trade surplus or non-market behavior,'' said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201dIf the two sides can implement these elements of the ceasefire, then they could begin negotiations on issues which generated the initial escalation in tensions in the first place.''",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has made aggressive use of tariffs. In addition to his levies on China, he has imposed \"baseline'' 10% taxes on imports from every country in the world . And he's announced even higher taxes \u2014 so-called reciprocal tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% \u2014 on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit.",
      "But after financial markets sank on fears of massive disruption to world trade, Trump suspended the reciprocal levies for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate reductions in their barriers to U.S. exports. That pause lasts until July 8.",
      "On Friday, Bessent told Fox Business Network that the talks could extend beyond the deadline and be \u201cwrapped up by Labor Day\u2019\u2019 Sept. 1 with 10 to 12 of America's most important trading partners.",
      "Trump further played down the July 8 deadline at a White House press conference Friday by noting that negotiations are ongoing but that \u201cwe have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries-plus. You can't do that.\u201d",
      "Instead of new trade deals, Trump said his administration would in coming days or weeks send out a letter where \u201cwe're just gonna tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States.''",
      "Separately, Trump took sudden aim at Canada Friday, saying on social media that he's immediately suspending trade talks with that country over its plan to impose a tax on technology firms next Monday. Trump called Canada's digital services tax \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d",
      "The digital services tax will hit companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It will apply retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion bill due at the end of the month.",

      "NEW YORK -- The WNBA is expanding to 18 teams over the next five years, with Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia all set to join the league by 2030.",
      "Cleveland will begin play in 2028, Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia the season after, assuming they get approval from the NBA and WNBA Board of Governors. Toronto and Portland will enter the league next year.",
      "\u201cThe demand for women\u2019s basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\u201d WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \u201cThis historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league\u2019s extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women\u2019s professional basketball.\u201d",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\u201d said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \u201cExtending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\u201d",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\u201d Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \u201cToday marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league\u2019s early growth, and we\u2019re proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\u201d",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock \u2014 the names of the previous teams \u2014 would be considered but they\u2019d do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\u201cRockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we\u2019re not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\u201d Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\u201cWe tell the city it\u2019s going to open in 2031. We\u2019re hoping for 2030,\u201d said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \u201cSo we\u2019re trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it\u2019s 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We\u2019ve got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they\u2019ll play there.\u201d",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\u201d Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \u201cI would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\u201d",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn\u2019t get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\u201d Engelbert said. \u201cGiven the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we\u2019re very careful about, you know, making sure we\u2019re balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\u201cBut one thing I\u2019m very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\u201d",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women\u2019s professional sports team,\u201d Barlage said. \u201cThe largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it\u2019s growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\u201d",

      "Wimbledon is preparing for the possibility of record-breaking Day 1 heat as the oldest Grand Slam tournament gets started",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Wimbledon was preparing for the possibility of record-breaking Day 1 heat as the oldest Grand Slam tournament got started Monday.",
      "The temperature shortly before play was scheduled to begin in the first matches at 11 a.m. local time was 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 Celsius) \u2014 not yet quite reaching the 85 F (29.3 C) measured during the first day of the 2001 fortnight.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll spend the whole day going from one shady spot to another,\u201d said Sally Bolton, the chief executive officer of the All England Club.",
      "\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a very warm day. The first obvious point to make is that the athletes compete in temperatures like this all year on the tour,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cFor us Brits here at The Championships, it feels very hot.\u201d",
      "The average daytime temperature in London in June is 71 F (21.5 C), although the government's official weather office said this spring was \u201cthe UK\u2019s warmest and sunniest\" since that's been tracked.",
      "Wimbledon, like other tennis tournaments, monitors air temperature, surface temperature and humidity for a heat-stress reading that, if it exceeds 30.1 C (about 86 F), allows for 10-minute breaks between the second and third sets of women's matches or between the third and fourth sets of men's matches.",
      "Among other precautions being taken Monday, Bolton said, were having more ice on court available for players to use to cool off, rotating ball girls and boys more frequently \u201cif we feel we need to,\u201d and giving regular breaks to workers around the grounds.",
      "As for fans, Bolton said, \u201cwe're offering the same advice as lots of the medical professionals: Come prepared. Bring a hat. Wear sunscreen. Wear light clothing if you can. Take breaks out of the sun. We\u2019ve got over 100 water points around the grounds, so definitely stay hydrated. And keep an eye on your friends and others around you. If people look like they're suffering a little bit from heat stress, we\u2019ve got a really significantly sized medical team here.\u201d",
      "This is nothing compared to what athletes and spectators experience during the local summers when the Australian Open is held in Melbourne in January or the U.S. Open is held in New York in August and September, when temperatures regularly get to 90 F (32 C) and can top 100 F (38 C).",
      "A 2023 Associated Press analysis showed the average high temperatures felt during the U.S. Open and the three other major tennis tournaments steadily have gotten higher and more dangerous in recent decades, reflecting the climate change that has created record heat waves. For the players, it can inhibit them from playing their best and, worse, increase the likelihood of heat-related illness.",
      "On Monday, fans were using umbrellas to offer shade, not protection from the drizzles often seen around these parts. A year ago, because of persistent showers, it took four days \u2014 instead of the scheduled two \u2014 to complete the first round.",
      "Thinking back to the rain-filled Wimbledon of 2024, Bolton joked: \u201cWe\u2019re not used to these sort of temperatures, but we\u2019re absolutely ready for it \u2014 and actually delighted that it's sunny and not wet, like it was last year.\u201d",

      "The 31 matches will be spread across Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lucerne, Sion, St. Gallen, Thun and Zurich. The opening game features Iceland against Finland on Wednesday at Arena Thun.",
      "Four of the stadiums have held matches in the men's European Championship, when Switzerland co-hosted the tournament with Austria in 2008.",
      "Here's a closer look at the cities and stadiums:",
      "Commonly considered to be the cultural capital of Switzerland, Basel boasts a rich history and is home to the oldest public art collection in the world, housed in the Kunstmuseum Basel since 1661. Basel is Switzerland\u2019s third-most-populous city and is situated in the northwest of the country, bordering both France and Germany. The Dreil\u00e4ndereck of Basel, also known as the tripoint, is a monument marking the exact point where the borders meet. Tennis great Roger Federer was born in Basel and is a big fan of its local soccer team.",
      "Stadium: St. Jakob-Park is Switzerland\u2019s largest soccer venue, with a capacity of 34,250. It will host five matches, including the final on July 27 and the home nation\u2019s opening match on Wednesday. It is the home of Swiss national champion Basel so has regularly hosted Champions League matches as well as Euro 2008 quarterfinals and a semifinal, and a Europa League final in 2016. The stadium is nicknamed \u201cJoggeli\u201d by the fans \u2014 a diminutive of \u201cJakob\u201d in the local dialect. It has also hosted many concerts.",
      "Switzerland\u2019s federal capital is located in the west-central part of the country. Bern city center is largely medieval and has been recognized by UNESCO as a Cultural World Heritage Site. The most famous sights are the Zytglogge, an elaborate medieval clock tower with moving puppets, and the M\u00fcnster, an impressive 15th century Gothic cathedral \u2014 the tallest in Switzerland. There is also a museum dedicated to Albert Einstein, at his former residence.",
      "Stadium: Stadion Wankdorf is the country's second-largest soccer stadium, with a capacity of 29,800. It is the home of the Young Boys soccer team. The venue opened in 2005 and was built on the grounds of the stadium that hosted the 1954 World Cup final. Bruce Springsteen, Elton John and Red Hot Chilli Peppers are among those to have played concerts in the stadium. It will host four matches at Euro 2025, including World Cup winner Spain\u2019s opening match against Portugal on July 3 as well as a quarterfinal.",
      "The second-most populous city in Switzerland, Geneva is a center for international diplomacy and finance. It hosts the highest number of international organizations in the world \u2014 including the European headquarters of the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the Red Cross. The city is located in southwestern Switzerland, almost encircled by the French border, in a picturesque basin at the tip of Lake Geneva and has a clear view of Mont Blanc, the highest Alpine peak.",
      "Stadium: Stade de Gen\u00e8ve has a capacity of 26,750 and was completed in 2003 after three years of construction. It hosted three group stage games during Euro 2008 and held other international fixtures, notably a friendly between Argentina and Portugal in 2011 \u2014 the first time Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo faced each other while playing for their countries. It regularly holds rugby matches and even ice hockey games. It will host five matches at Euro 2025, including a quarterfinal and semifinal.",
      "With a population of approximately 83,000 people, Lucerne is the most populous city in central Switzerland. It boasts the oldest covered bridge in Europe, built in 1333. It also has a colorful old town, where the buildings are decorated with murals depicting village life and hunting scenes from the olden days. That adds to the picturesque quality of Lucerne, which is set on the shores of Lake Lucerne and the River Reuss.",
      "Stadium: Allmend Stadion Luzern, which opened in 2011, was completely rebuilt after the previous stadium was deemed no longer suitable for use in the Swiss Super League. It has a matchday capacity of 14,350 and will be used for three group stage matches \u2014 all involving the two tournament debutants, Poland and Wales.",
      "Situated near the Italian and French borders, Sion is one of the driest and sunniest areas of Switzerland. Sion is one of Europe\u2019s most significant prehistoric sites with the first settlements dating back to 6200 BC. The city is dotted with hills, the highest of which is Tourbillon with the ruins of a castle. On the opposite hill stands the Basilique de Val\u00e8re, which houses the oldest playable organ in the world, built in the early 1430s. Sion has had multiple bids to host the Winter Olympics but never won.",
      "Stadium: The Stade de Tourbillon is the smallest of all the venues for Euro 2025 as it has a matchday capacity of just 7,750. It has nevertheless hosted a number of men\u2019s international matches, including one of Switzerland\u2019s qualifiers for Euro 2020. It is named after the castle that overlooks the city.",
      "Nestled in a northeastern valley between Lake Constance and the Appenzell Alps, St. Gallen is one of the highest cities in Switzerland. Its university is considered one of the best business schools in Europe and its Abbey District, which includes a medieval monastic library, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.",
      "Stadium: Arena St. Gallen opened in 2008 and will have a capacity of 16,300 at Euro 2025, where it will host three group stage matches \u2014 including defending champion England\u2019s game against Wales. The city\u2019s largest solar-electric power plant was installed on the stadium roof in 2015. The system was expanded at the start of this year and will now generate enough solar power for the needs of approximately 288 four-person households.",
      "Thun is located about 30 kilometers southeast of Bern, where the river Aare flows out of Lake Thun. It has stunning views of the Bernese Alps. There is also a 12th-century castle, with impressive turrets, overlooking the old town.",
      "Stadium: Arena Thun is the second smallest of the venues, with a capacity of 8,100. It opened in 2011 and was built on the site of the old stadium. Natural turf will be laid over the existing artificial turf for the three group stage matches it will host during Euro 2025, including world champion Spain against Belgium.",
      "Zurich is the most populous city in Switzerland and lies in the north of the country near the Alps. The Old Town stretches on both sides of the river Limmat, which flows out of Lake Zurich. It is an international hub for banking and insurance and also the home to FIFA.",
      "Stadium: Stadion Letzigrund has a capacity of 22,700 and is home to an athletics club and three soccer teams. Concerts have been staged there as well as men\u2019s and women\u2019s international matches and three group stage games at Euro 2008. It will host five matches at Euro 2025, including two of defending champion England\u2019s group games and a quarterfinal and semifinal. In 1960, Armin Hary became the first man to run 100 meters in 10 seconds on the track at the old Letzigrund stadium, which was demolished and rebuilt, reopening in 2007. Many athletes have set world records at the Weltklasse Z\u00fcrich, a track and field meeting that has been held at the stadium for nearly 100 years.",

      "LONDON -- This year's visit to Wimbledon is special for Petra Kvitova.",
      "It marks her return to competition at the All England Club \u2014 the site of her two greatest triumphs as a professional tennis player \u2014 after missing the event last year while on maternity leave.",
      "And it also marks her farewell to the grass-court Grand Slam tournament she won in 2011 and 2014: Kvitova, a 35-year-old left-hander from the Czech Republic, announced 1 1/2 weeks ago that she plans to leave the tour after the U.S. Open, which ends in September.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to see that she\u2019s retiring, because I remember playing her when I just started,\u201d said Aryna Sabalenka, 27, the three-time major champion who is seeded No. 1 at the All England Club. \u201cI\u2019m kind of sad. I was thinking when I saw the news: \u2018Come on. Give it try. Why? Why would you retire? Keep going.\u2019\u201d",
      "Kvitova, who received a wild-card invitation from the tournament, was scheduled to play in the first round of Wimbledon on Tuesday against No. 10 seed Emma Navarro of the United States.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll be amazing, for sure. It\u2019s my favorite tournament. It always has been and it always will be. So it\u2019ll be very nice to be back,\u201d Kvitova said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s always brought me so many memories. Some really good memories, of course. But also bad memories, because losing with the pressure there is hard. Even with the two best results of my career, I do feel like sometimes the losses were very, very painful. But at the end of the day, winning two titles is what counts the most.\u201d",
      "Kvitova's first two appearances at the tournament she refers to as \u201cWimby\u201d did not go perfectly. She lost her opening matches in both 2008 and 2009.",
      "But the following year, she made it all the way the semifinals. And then, in 2011, Kvitova beat Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-4 in the final. Three years later, Kvitova earned her second trophy, defeating Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-0 in the title match.",
      "\u201cIt took me a while,\u201d Kvitova said, \u201cto get used to the grass.\u201d",
      "Kvitova, who's been ranked as high as No. 2 but is currently outside the top 500 because of her absence and a 1-6 record since her February comeback, also associates two other key memories with Wimbledon. Jiri Vanek, her coach since 2016, proposed to Kvitova at Centre Court and they're now married. Their first child, a son named Petr, was born during the middle weekend of the 2024 fortnight.",
      "Kvitova described her 17 months away from the tour as feeling akin to just a short break.",
      "\u201cIt actually feels like I never quit. It feels like I\u2019ve been here every year,\u201d she said before returning to Grand Slam action at the French Open in May. \u201cMy mindset is still in a good place, so it feels good to be here. And my game is getting better.\u201d",
      "Motherhood does present its challenges, as for any working mom. The biggest difficulty, Kvitova said, has been being away from her family when they don't accompany her when she is playing.",
      "\u201cTraveling together is not easy sometimes, either. The worst part is the logistics that come with it. Having so much stuff. Being in the hotel room it can be a little tough, especially when they\u2019re small. He is starting to crawl and everything, so it\u2019s a mess everywhere,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it also is fun. He\u2019s a very good boy, so that makes it all a little bit easier.\u201d",

      "Matt Freese made three saves in six shootout attempts to lead the U.S. to victory over Costa Rica in the quarterfinals of the Gold Cup",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- After losing a second-half lead to Costa Rica, this young U.S. side was forced into a shootout with the daunting task of facing goalkeeper Keylor Navas.",
      "Matt Freese studied for this. Literally.",
      "The late-blooming national team rookie, who made a costly mistake in the previous match, actually conducted an in-depth research project in college at Harvard about penalty kicks.",
      "Freese spent the flight to Minneapolis reviewing his findings and examining Costa Rica's tendencies, time well spent that fueled his steely performance in the CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinal victory on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cTo be able to rely on that type of thing and deal with a lot of statistics and read the game and read their hips, things like that, is massive,\u201d Freese said after making three saves in the six-round shootout won 4-3 by the Americans after a 2-2 tie in regulation.",
      "The Americans play Guatemala in the semifinals on Wednesday in St. Louis. If the U.S. can rely on Freese like this moving forward, that too would be an enormous boost.",
      "The 26-year-old native of Pennsylvania, who has displaced for now 2022 World Cup and 2023 Gold Cup starter Matt Turner, knocked away shootout attempts by Juan Pablo Vargas, Francisco Calvo and Andy Rojas. Calvo scored on Freese in the 12th minute on a penalty kick.",
      "Freese, a little-used backup for Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union before a trade to New York City FC in 2023 jump-started his career, has had little time with the national team for training. His path was only cleared this spring by injuries to Patrick Schulte and Zack Steffen.",
      "But new coach Mauricio Pochettino has been determined to push his young players into the deep end during this biennial championship for North America, Central America and the Caribbean, with Freese at the forefront of the experiment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just got to be ready for whatever game I get, for whatever moment is there for me,\u201d said Freese, who gave up one goal in three group stage matches. \u201cHe\u2019s shown a lot of faith in me. That\u2019s something I\u2019m really grateful for, and it\u2019s my job to repay him and help the team win.\u201d",
      "The goal Freese gave up during the group stage was quite a gaffe, a misfired clearing attempt against Haiti that set up the tying goal in a game the U.S. won 2-1. But Pochettino and his staff had no problem sending Freese back to the net for the knockout rounds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to show you can bounce back, an opportunity to learn and quickly move on to the next,\u201d Freese said.",
      "Turner played only three club matches in the recently ended season for Crystal Palace, all in the FA Cup and none since March 1. The critical position is wide open for Freese \u2014 or anyone \u2014 to seize it with the North American World Cup looming next summer.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s good for Matt, for the rest of the keepers, to see that they can have the possibility and deal with the pressure,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cBecause you never know what\u2019s going to happen in one year. Now is the moment to test or to give the possibility to show that they can deal with that stress and perform.\u201d",
      "Pochettino didn't directly answer a question about whether Freese has passed Turner on the depth chart. But the native of Argentina, who began his playing career with the same club that Navas stars for and briefly managed him with Paris Saint-Germain, was clearly pleased by the way his keeper stepped up with one of the best in the world during the dramatic shootout.",
      "After each save, Freese told himself he wanted another one. After the third diving stop, he became especially demonstrative \u2014 nodding his head and sticking out his tongue toward his cheering teammates at midfield.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done extremely well. He\u2019s worked extremely hard,\" said Diego Luna, who scored his first international goal for the U.S. in the first half. \u201cThese are the type of moments that we live for.\u201d",

      "Reed, who started the final round with a three-shot lead, fell behind late in the day at Maridoe Golf Club until Jinichiro Kozuma made bogey on the 18th hole and then made par on his final hole at No. 1 for a 68.",

      "\u201cTo get my first win here, part of LIV, it means so much to me,\u201d Reed said. \u201cI tried to mess it up. After making birdie on the first, I seemed to leave every putt short.\u201d",

      "Giving Funds is GoFundMe\u2019s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered",
      "NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall.",
      "Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived.",
      "\u201cIt was just a bit of a thing,\u201d he added. \"If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.\u201d",
      "Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers \u2014 products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts.",
      "To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they\u2019re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they\u2019re coming in and they\u2019re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cThat connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.\u201d",
      "Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit.",
      "The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals.",
      "There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements.",
      "GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors.",
      "Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving \u2014 something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as \u201cwealth management products.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a giving product,\u201d Cadogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for everybody. And you don\u2019t need to know the words \u2018donor advised fund.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d",
      "DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes \u2014 even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023.",
      "Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas.",
      "That \u201cdynamic, alive community\u201d is very different from the \u201cfairly static, passive\u201d financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially inspiring the money to move,\u201d he said.",
      "Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning.",
      "Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the \u201csweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.\u201d",
      "The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are \u201cavailable-to-everyone vehicles\" considering that half run balances under $50,000.",
      "\u201cGivers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.\u201d",
      "But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as \u201ca game changer\u201d that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years.",
      "Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a \u201csavings account\" for \"good works.\"",
      "\u201cAnd GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,\u201d she said.",

      "According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies without any human intervention or supervision.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility",
      "They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.",
      "China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions like marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans.

      "Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school\u2019s research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decision-making, player formations, and passing strategies\u2014including variables such as speed, force, and direction, according to Cheng.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- In the time before widespread vaccination, death often came early.",
      "Devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems. These illnesses were the main reason why nearly one in five children in 1900 never made it to their fifth birthday.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2013 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of these preventable diseases all too well. For them, news of measles outbreaks and rising whooping cough cases brings back terrible memories of lives forever changed \u2013 and a longing to spare others from similar pain.",
      "With a mother\u2019s practiced, guiding hand, 80-year-old Janith Farnham helped steer her 60-year-old daughter\u2019s walker through a Sioux Falls art center. They stopped at a painting of a cow wearing a hat.",
      "Janith pointed to the hat, then to her daughter Jacque\u2019s Minnesota Twins cap. Jacque did the same.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so funny!\u201d Janith said, leaning in close to say the words in sign language too.",
      "Jacque was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause a host of issues including hearing impairment, eye problems, heart defects and intellectual disabilities. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted the viral illness very early in the pregnancy, when she had up to a 90% chance of giving birth to a baby with the syndrome.",
      "Janith recalled knowing \u201cthings weren\u2019t right\u201d almost immediately. The baby wouldn\u2019t respond to sounds or look at anything but lights. She didn\u2019t like to be held close. Her tiny heart sounded like it purred \u2013 evidence of a problem that required surgery at four months old.",
      "Janith did all she could to help Jacque thrive, sending her to the Colorado School for the Deaf and the Blind and using skills she honed as a special education teacher. She and other parents of children with the syndrome shared insights in a support group.",
      "Meanwhile, the condition kept taking its toll. As a young adult, Jacque developed diabetes, glaucoma and autistic behaviors. Eventually, arthritis set in.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home a short drive from Janith's place. Above her bed is a net overflowing with stuffed animals. On a headboard shelf are photo books Janith created, filled with memories like birthday parties and trips to Mount Rushmore.",
      "Jacque\u2019s days typically begin with an insulin shot and breakfast before she heads off to a day program. She gets together with her mom four or five days a week. They often hang out at Janith\u2019s townhome, where Jacque has another bedroom decorated with her own artwork and quilts Janith sewed for her. Jacque loves playing with Janith\u2019s dog, watching sports on television and looking up things on her iPad.",
      "Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor, gratefulness, curiosity and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous\u201d to family, friends and new people she meets.",
      "\u201cWhen you live through so much pain and so much difficulty and so much challenge, sometimes I think: Well, she doesn\u2019t know any different,\u201d Janith said.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith believes younger people are being selfish if they choose not to get their children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than frustrating. I mean, I get angry inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what can happen, and I just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls getting home from work, opening the car door and hearing her mother scream. Inside the house, her little sister Karen lay unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, and Karen was 6. She\u2019d contracted measles shortly after Easter. While an early vaccine was available, it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, but their mother didn't share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt's not that she was against it,\" Tobin said. \"She just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. Karen \u2013 who Tobin described as a \u201cvery endearing, sweet child\u201d who would walk around the house singing \u2013 quickly became very sick. The afternoon she collapsed in the bathroom, Tobin, then 19, called the ambulance. Karen never regained consciousness.",
      "\u201cShe immediately went into a coma and she died of encephalitis,\u201d said Tobin, who stayed at her bedside in the hospital. \u201cWe never did get to speak to her again.\u201d",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions allowed for medical, religious or philosophical reasons. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very upset by how cavalier people are being about the measles,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they realize how destructive this is.\u201d",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "\u201cI could only see my parents through a glass window. They were crying and I was screaming my head off,\u201d said Duguay, 68. \u201cThey told my parents I would never walk or move again.\u201d",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It mostly preyed on children and was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio's visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Duguay initially defied her doctors. After intensive treatment and physical therapy, she walked and even ran \u2013 albeit with a limp. She got married, raised a son and worked as a medical transcriptionist.",
      "But in her early 40s, she noticed she couldn\u2019t walk as far as she used to. A doctor confirmed she was in the early stages of post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time.",
      "One morning, she tried to stand up and couldn\u2019t move her left leg.",
      "After two weeks in a rehab facility, she started painting to stay busy. Eventually, she joined arts organizations and began showing and selling her work. Art \"gives me a sense of purpose,\u201d she said.",
      "These days, she can't hold up her arms long enough to create big oil paintings at an easel. So she pulls her wheelchair up to an electric desk to paint on smaller surfaces like stones and petrified wood.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn't just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further. \u201c Herd immunity \" keeps everyone safe by preventing outbreaks that can sicken the vulnerable.",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009 after Van Tornhout and her husband tried five years for a baby. She was six weeks early but healthy.",
      "\u201cShe loved to have her feet rubbed,\" said the 40-year-old Lakeville, Indiana mom. \"She was this perfect baby.\u201d",
      "When Callie turned a month old, she began to cough, prompting a visit to the doctor, who didn\u2019t suspect anything serious. By the following night, Callie was doing worse. They went back.",
      "In the waiting room, she became blue and limp in Van Tornhout\u2019s arms. The medical team whisked her away and beat lightly on her back. She took a deep breath and giggled.",
      "Though the giggle was reassuring, the Van Tornhouts went to the ER, where Callie\u2019s skin turned blue again. For a while, medical treatment helped. But at one point she started squirming, and medical staff frantically tried to save her.",
      "\u201cWithin minutes,\u201d Van Tornhout said, \u201cshe was gone.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout recalled sitting with her husband and their lifeless baby for four hours, \"just talking to her, thinking about what could have been.\u201d",
      "Callie\u2019s viewing was held on her original due date \u2013 the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called to confirm she had pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "Today, next to the cast of Callie\u2019s foot is an urn with her ashes and a glass curio cabinet filled with mementos like baby shoes.",
      "\u201cMy kids to this day will still look up and say, \u2018Hey Callie, how are you?\u2019\u201d said Van Tornhout, who has four children and a stepson. \u201cShe\u2019s part of all of us every day.\u201d",
      "Van Tornhout now advocates for childhood immunization through the nonprofit Vaccinate Your Family. She also shares her story with people she meets, like a pregnant customer who came into the restaurant her family ran saying she didn\u2019t want to immunize her baby. She later returned with her vaccinated four-month-old.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2013 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d",

      "Ticks can be active in any season and experts say it\u2019s important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ticks can be active in any season and it's important to check for and remove the bloodsuckers as quickly as possible \u2014 especially after you've been outside hiking, gardening or enjoying nature.",
      "\u201cHumans are outside more in summer so we hear about more tick infections,\u201d said Sam Telford, an infectious diseases expert at Tufts University. But he urges caution year-round because \u201cevery season is tick season.\u201d",
      "While tick populations vary a lot regionally, some Northeastern states including Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island are seeing \u201cabove average\u201d numbers of American dog ticks this year, said Telford.",
      "And New York state is seeing a higher number of reported deer tick bites this year than last year, said Saravanan Thangamani, who studies tick-borne diseases at SUNY Upstate Medical University.",
      "Ticks, like mosquitos, need to feed on blood. But instead of a quick prick, they are slow feeders \u2013 with hooked mouth parts that attach into the skin of deer, rabbits, dogs and people.",
      "There are many different species of ticks found globally and only some spread germs that can make people sick. A main worry is blacklegged ticks, also called deer ticks, which can spread Lyme disease. Once found mainly in New England and pockets of the Midwest, the ticks are now present over a wider range.",
      "A tick bite doesn't always lead to illness. \u201cIf you remove a tick within 24 hours of attachment, it\u2019s fairly unlikely that you will get infected,\u201d said Telford.",
      "Ticks are usually found low to the ground, in leaf litter or grassy areas.",
      "Check your clothing for ticks and do a full-body check including under the arms and behind ears, knees and hair.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out all day long, try to do a quick check for ticks every few hours,\u201d said Bobbi Pritt at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWhen you go back inside, take a shower. That will wash off any unattached ticks, and you\u2019re also more likely to spot any other ticks.\"",
      "Use tweezers to remove the tick and grasp it as close to the skin as possible to pull from the head. If you don\u2019t have them handy, you can also use your fingernails, the edge of a credit card or any semi-sharp object.",
      "The best approach is to minimize tick exposure altogether.",
      "Bug sprays containing ingredients such as DEET can be sprayed on exposed skin to ward off ticks and mosquitos, said Telford.",
      "Wear long sleeves and pants, and you can also spray clothing with repellents containing permethrin, a chemical similar to a natural ingredient in chrysanthemums that makes ticks avoid the flowers.",
      "Don\u2019t forget to pay attention to outdoor pets. Medications can prevent fleas and ticks from attaching to a dog's skin. But it\u2019s still a good idea to check the fur after being outside.",
      "\u201cWherever pets can\u2019t easily groom themselves, that\u2019s where the ticks will be \u2013 on the ears, around the muzzle area, under the collar, between the toes,\u201d said Thangamani.",
      "Dogs and cats roaming outdoors can also bring ticks into the house.",
      "\u201cIf pets bring ticks in, a tick can live in the house for months until it finds its next blood meal,\u201d which could be another household member, he said.",
      "After removing the tick, keep an eye on the skin around the bite. If a rash or flu-like symptoms appear within several days or weeks, see a doctor.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend tick testing because results may not be reliable.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",
      "Gavi is a public-private partnership including WHO, UNICEF, the Gates Foundation and the World Bank. It has paid for more than 1 billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. The United States has long been one of its biggest supporters; before Donald Trump\u2019s re-election, the country had pledged $1 billion through 2030.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "The three countries shared the tab for the two-week mission. Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the deal, put the ticket price at more than $65 million per customer.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center two weeks late because of space station leak concerns. The capsule on top carried not only the three newcomers to space \u2014 none of whom were alive when their countries\u2019 first astronauts launched \u2014 but America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts sometimes pressed into temporary duty.",
      "The astronauts are due to arrive at the orbiting lab the next morning.",
      "In addition to dozens of experiments, the astronauts are flying food that celebrates their heritage: Indian curry and rice with mango nectar; spicy Hungarian paprika paste; and freeze-fried Polish pierogies.",
      "Hungary\u2019s first astronaut, Bertalan Farkas, cheered on Kapu from the launch site.",
      "\u201cFor such a small country as Hungary, it is really important to collaborate in a peaceful international space cooperation,\u201d Farkas told The Associated Press. He called it \u201cone of the most important moments\" of his life.",
      "Farkas launched with the Soviets in 1980, taking along a teddy bear in a cosmonaut suit that went back up with Kapu. India and Poland\u2019s original astronauts also launched with the Soviets in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski carried up the Polish flag worn on his predecessor\u2019s spacesuit, noting that Miroslaw Hermaszewski was his biggest supporter until his death in 2022. India\u2019s first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, couldn\u2019t make it to Florida for the launch; Shukla said he\u2019s been a mentor \u201cat every step of this journey\u201d and is flying a surprise gift for him.",
      "While others born in India and Hungary have flown in space before \u2014 including NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, who died aboard the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and two-time space tourist Charles Simonyi, of Microsoft fame \u2014 they were U.S. citizens at the time of launch.",
      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone. The trip caused her to miss her induction into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame late last month, since she was in quarantine before the flight. Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",
      "Once opposed to nontraditional station guests, NASA now throws out the welcome mat, charging for their food and upkeep while insisting that an experienced astronaut accompany them.",
      "It\u2019s all part of NASA\u2019s push to open space \u2014 moon included \u2014 to private businesses. Axiom is among several U.S. companies planning to launch their own space stations in the next few years. The goal is for them to be up and running before the international station comes down in 2031 after more than three decades of operation.",
      "Access to space \u201cis not only for the biggest agencies anymore \u2014 space is for everyone,\u201d Poland\u2019s Uznanski-Wisniewski said ahead of liftoff. He repeated the sentiment upon reaching orbit.",
      "Hungarians want to \u201csit at the same table with the giants,\u201d said Kapu. Through this mission, \u201cHungary gets one step closer to the stars.\u201d",
      "They should have flown earlier this year, but their mission was delayed following a switch in SpaceX capsules. The change enabled NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to return to Earth in March sooner than planned.",
      "The Axiom astronauts faced more launch delays once arriving in Florida. SpaceX had to fix an oxygen leak in its rocket, then NASA put the crew\u2019s visit on indefinite hold while monitoring repairs to longtime air leaks on the Russian side of the space station.",
      "Once in orbit, the astronauts radioed messages in their native languages and revealed the name they gave to their brand-new capsule: Grace.",
      "\u201cGood things come to those who wait,\" SpaceX told the crew. \"Godspeed to the maiden crew of Grace.\u201d",
      "SpaceX CEO and founder Elon Musk\u2019s Falcon rockets launching from Florida and California are considerably smaller than the Starships making test flights out of Texas and, this year, exploding one after the other.

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran will \u201ccertainly\u201d hurt Russia long-term, Albright said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Hackers backing Tehran have targeted U.S. banks, defense contractors and oil industry companies following American strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 but so far have not caused widespread disruptions to critical infrastructure or the economy.",
      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",
      "The U.S. strikes could even prompt Iran, Russia, China and North Korea to double down on investments in cyberwarfare, according to Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor.",
      "Bellini noted that hacking operations are much cheaper than bullets, planes or nuclear arms \u2014 what defense analysts call kinetic warfare. America may be militarily dominant, he said, but its reliance on digital technology poses a vulnerability.",

      "Two pro-Palestinian hacking groups claimed they targeted more than a dozen aviation firms, banks and oil companies following the U.S. strikes over the weekend.",
      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",

      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",

So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "But the company is still on the hook and must now go to trial over how it acquired those books by downloading them from online \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated copies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",
      "\u201cThat Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "The ruling could set a precedent for similar lawsuits that have piled up against Anthropic competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, as well as against Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",
      "The authors' attorneys declined comment.",

      "LONDON -- Google could be forced to let British users choose whether to use rival search services, the country's antitrust watchdog said Tuesday as it proposed using new digital regulations to boost competition.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority said its \u201cpriority measures\u201d include requiring Google to present users with \u201cchoice screens\u201d when they use key products like the Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system.",
      "The choice screens would let users \u201ceasily select and switch between search services,\" which could potentially include AI assistants, it said.",
      "The watchdog is seeking to give Google a \u201c strategic market status \u201d label under the new U.K. digital rules. That would give it the power to use \u201ctargeted measures\u201d to impose changes to \u201cspecific aspects\u201d of its search operations in the U.K.",
      "The CMA's move \u201ccould have significant implications for businesses and consumers in the UK,\u201d Google said.",

      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",

      "The highly anticipated trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is nearing its end. Combs has been accused of sex trafficking by force, transportation to engage in prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy as part of a blockbuster federal indictment originally filed in September 2024. He later faced two additional superseding indictments. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",
      "Combs is accused of being the ringleader of an alleged enterprise that \"abused, threatened and coerced women\" into prolonged, drug-fueled sexual orgies with male prostitutes, which he called \"freak-offs,\" and then threatened them into silence. Combs has said that all of the sex was consensual and that while his relationships sometimes involved domestic violence, he wasn't engaged in trafficking.",

      "Combs\u2019 mother, twin daughters and sons were seated behind him in the gallery as the judge instructed jurors to base their decision \u201cexclusively on the evidence or lack of evidence.\u201d",
      "The first job for jurors is to elect a foreperson and to send a note to the court indicating who that is.",
      "The jury has been provided with portions of the trial transcript, a laptop with the evidence loaded onto it, a list of exhibits, a copy of the judge\u2019s instructions, and a copy of the verdict sheet.",
      "Alternate jurors are not dismissed. The judge told them that while they do not have to remain in the courthouse during deliberations, they must adhere to all of the instructions until a verdict is reached. Alternates also must provide a phone number where they can be reached in case they\u2019re needed.",

      "Subramanian noted that the jury could decide to fully disregard the testimony of a witness if they believe he or she intentionally provided false information on the stand.",
      "\u201cIf you find that any witness has willfully testified falsely \u2026 you have the right to reject the testimony of that witness in its entirety,\u201d Subramanian said. \u201cA witness may be inaccurate or contradictory but be truthful or entirely credible in other parts of their testimony.\u201d",

      "The defense asked jurors to \u201csummon the courage\u201d to acquit Combs, who conceded he could be violent, jealous and a drug user but whose lawyers argued faced a \u201cbadly, badly exaggerated\u201d case to make him appear to be something he is not.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Only 36% of Democrats say they're \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American, according to a new Gallup poll, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people.",
      "The findings are a stark illustration of how many \u2014 but not all \u2014 Americans have felt less of a sense of pride in their country over the past decade. The split between Democrats and Republicans, at 56 percentage points, is at its widest since 2001. That includes all four years of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults who are part of Generation Z, which is defined as those born from 1997 to 2012, expressed a high level of pride in being American in Gallup surveys conducted in the past five years, on average. That's compared with about 6 in 10 Millennials \u2014 those born between 1980 and 1996 \u2014 and at least 7 in 10 U.S. adults in older generations.",
      "\u201cEach generation is less patriotic than the prior generation, and Gen Z is definitely much lower than anybody else,\u201d said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. \u201cBut even among the older generations, we see that they're less patriotic than the ones before them, and they've become less patriotic over time. That's primarily driven by Democrats within those generations.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s decline in national pride has been a slow erosion, with a steady downtick in Gallup's data since January 2001, when the question was first asked.",
      "Even during the tumultuous early years of the Iraq War, the vast majority of U.S. adults, whether Republican or Democrat, said they were \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American. At that point, about 9 in 10 were \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American. That remained high in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but the consensus around American pride slipped in the years that followed, dropping to about 8 in 10 in 2006 and continuing a gradual decline.",
      "Now, 58% of U.S. adults say that, in a downward shift that\u2019s been driven almost entirely by Democrats and independents. The vast majority of Republicans continue to say they're proud to be American.",
      "Independents\u2019 pride in their national identity hit a new low in the most recent survey, at 53%, largely following that pattern of gradual decline.",
      "Democrats\u2019 diminished pride in being American is more clearly linked to Trump\u2019s time in office. When Trump first entered the White House, in 2017, about two-thirds of Democrats said they were proud to be American. That had fallen to 42% by 2020, just before Trump lost reelection to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "But while Democrats\u2019 sense of national pride rebounded when Biden took office, it didn\u2019t go back to its pre-Trump levels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a Trump story,\" Jones said. \u201cSomething else is going on, and I think it\u2019s just younger generations coming in and not being as patriotic as older people.\u201d",
      "Other recent polling shows that Democrats and independents are less likely than Republicans to say that expressing patriotism is important or to feel a sense of pride in their national leaders.",
      "Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans in a 2024 SSRS poll said they believed patriotism has a positive impact on the United States, with Democrats more divided: 45% said patriotism had a positive impact on the country, while 37% said it was negative.",
      "But a more general sense of discontent was clear on both sides of the aisle earlier this year, when a CNN/SSRS poll found that fewer than 1 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said \u201cproud\u201d described the way they felt about politics in America today.",
      "In that survey, most Americans across the political spectrum said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d or \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the country\u2019s politics.",

      "Trump threatened to primary him after he voted no on the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said Sunday that he will not seek reelection next year in battleground North Carolina. The stunning announcement comes just hours after President Donald Trump said he will start fielding primary challengers to run against Tillis following the senator's vote against advancing Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to a vote in the Senate.",
      "The senator, in a lengthy statement announcing his decision, said it was \u201cnot a hard choice\u201d to rule out running for a third term as he was finished with \u201cnavigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington.\u201d",
      "Tillis is committed to opposing the Republican megabill -- a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s domestic policy agenda -- because of its Medicaid provisions. He caught the president's ire on Saturday night after voting against moving the legislation to final consideration in the Senate.",
      "Trump responded quickly, saying on his social media platform that he\u2019d be meeting with people in the coming weeks to consider who would challenge Tillis in a Republican primary.",
      "Trump accused Tillis of \"grandstanding\" and said that he was \"making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!\"",
      "Trump reacted to Tillis' announcement late Sunday afternoon on his social media platform, calling it \"Great News!\"",
      "In his announcement, Tillis likened himself to former Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema -- two lawmakers who retired last cycle after years of pushback from party leaders for often bucking their caucus, particularly on the issue of preserving the Senate filibuster.",
      "\"They were shunned after they courageously refused to cave to their party bosses,\" Tillis wrote, adding: \"It's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species.\"",
      "\u201cIt underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics. When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them,\u201d Tillis wrote.",
      "Tillis had for weeks been a staunch opponent to the Senate version of the reconciliation bill\u2019s provider tax proposal -- a provision that he said North Carolina would lose the most Medicaid coverage under.",
      "During a closed-door GOP conference meeting last week, Tillis is reported to have made the point that Medicaid coverage for more than 600,000 North Carolinians would be at risk under the Senate's proposal and asked his colleagues to consider how the policy would impact their own states -- even providing state-specific data printed out on a handout.",
      "He warned his colleagues of the political implications of the Senate's Medicaid provider tax framework if it becomes law.",

      "In February, after Trump called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a dictator and suggested that Ukraine started the war with Russia, Tillis went farther than any Republican was willing to go, directly invoking Trump's name in a Senate floor speech that bashed Russian President Vladimir Putin and called for a full defense of Ukraine.",

I support President Trump and I believe that most of his policies on national security are right, I believe his instincts are pretty good, but what I am telling you whoever believes that there is any space for Vladimir Putin in the future of a stable globe better go to Ukraine, they better go to Europe, they better invest the time to understand that this man is a cancer and the greatest threat to democracy in my life time,\" Tillis said during his fiery floor speech.",

    "story": [
      "The administration can start planning how it will end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday handed down a highly-anticipated ruling involving President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship.",
      "But many questions remain about how such an order would be carried out on a practical level.",
      "And while the court's conservative majority limited nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges against the order, the court did not rule on whether the order itself is constitutional.",
      "Still, the decision could lead to a radical reshaping of a legal right to citizenship that's been long guaranteed by the 14th Amendment -- at least in the short term.",
      "Effective immediately, the administration can begin planning for how it would implement an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Trump's order itself has a 30-day grace period before taking effect, meaning right now there is no change to birthright citizenship and children born everywhere in the country are still U.S. citizens.",
      "Regulations will need to be drafted and specifics of such an order still need to be addressed: for example, will every pregnant woman in America now need to go to the hospital with a passport or birth certificate?",
      "The White House on Friday had no clear answers when pressed for specifics.",
      "Federal district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and New Hampshire will soon have to revisit nationwide injunctions issued there in light of the court's decision and tailor or narrow them to apply only to the plaintiffs who brought these cases.",
      "The plaintiffs were 22 states, immigrant advocacy groups and a number of pregnant noncitizen women.",
      "Challengers to Trump's executive order will continue to litigate the order on the merits. No court has directly considered the constitutionality of the executive order, though three lower courts have said it would appear to plainly violate the 14th Amendment and there are three longstanding Supreme Court precedents unambiguously upholding birthright citizenship.",
      "But for the remaining 28 states that have not sued, Trump's attempts to end birthright citizenship could go into effect in as soon as 30 days.",
      "Challengers can and will also fight broad implementation in other ways as it moves forward.",
      "On Friday, one group filed a class action lawsuit seeking broad protection of all noncitizen pregnant women, even those who are not plaintiffs.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated plaintiffs might also be able to challenge the administration's citizenship regulations, once issued, under the Administrative Procedures Act.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, though, struggled on Friday to address how exactly administration is planning to implement Trump's order.",
      "Asked who would be tasked with vetting citizenship (for example, whether it would be nurses or doctors as babies are being born) Bondi only responded: \"This is all pending litigation.\"",
      "Another reporter asked Bondi, \"If you have an undocumented baby, would that baby then be an enforcement priority?\"",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority,\" Bondi deflected.",
      "What's next for nationwide injunctions?",
      "More broadly, the administration will likely seek to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking Trump policies in other cases.",
      "Those hearings and decisions will play out in the coming weeks.",
      "\"These injunctions have blocked our policies from tariffs to military readiness to immigration to foreign affairs, fraud, abuse and many other issues,\" Bondi said on Friday. \"The judges have tried to seize the executive branch's power and they cannot do that. No longer.\"",
      "President Trump said similarly as he celebrated the ruling.",
      "\"So, thanks to this decision, we can now promptly filed to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people,\" the president said.",

    "story": [
      "Graham said he believes the regime still wants to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham said it's \"too early to tell\" if Iran has given up its nuclear ambitions following U.S. strikes against key nuclear facilities in the country, but the Trump ally said he believes it's still the regime's \"desire\" to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "On Friday, President Donald Trump seemed to dismiss the potential for Iran to resume its enrichment program, telling reporters, \"The last thing they're thinking about right now is enriched uranium.\"",
      "Pressed by \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl about those comments and whether Iran has given up its \"ambitions to be a nuclear power,\" Graham said, \"Too early to tell. I do agree that the three sites were obliterated.\"",
      "But, the South Carolina Republican argued that while Iran is \"done with that enrichment program,\" the regime is \"not done wanting to destroy Israel or trying to come after us.\"",
      "\"Operation Midnight Hammer was a tremendous military success. It set the program back, I think, a couple years,\" Graham said. \"But the question for the world, does the regime still desire to make a nuclear weapon? The answer is yes. Do they still desire to destroy Israel and come after us? The answer is yes. Until that changes, we've got to keep our -- we're in trouble.\"",
      "Trump has suggested there may be a meeting with the Iranians at some point soon. Graham said he believes Iran must publicly affirm Israel's sovereignty before any such meeting should occur.",
      "\"Here's the requirement to sit down and talk: They have to say, for the first time, the Iranian regime, 'We recognize Israel's right to exist. We don't like the state, we don't like what they do, but we recognize Israel has the right to exist as a people,'\" Graham said. \"If they can't say that, you're never going to get a deal worth a damn. So before you sit down with the Iranians, make them say publicly for the first time, 'Israel has a right to exist,' and they can't say that, that tells you all you need to know about who you're dealing with.\"",
      "Here are more highlights from Graham's interview:",
      "Graham: So what does this bill do? If you're buying products from Russia and you're not helping Ukraine, then there's a 500% tariff on your products coming to the United States. India and China buy 70% of Putin's oil. They keep his war machine going. My bill has 84 co-sponsors. It would allow the President to put tariffs on China and India and other countries, to get them \u2014 stop them from supporting Putin's war machine, to get him to the table for the first time yesterday, the President told me --",
      "Karl: You were playing golf with him.",
      "Graham: Yeah, I was playing golf with him. He says, 'It's time to move, move your bill.' 'There's a waiver in the bill, Mr. President, you're in charge of whether or not it's to be implemented.' But we're going to give President Trump a tool in the toolbox he doesn't have today. After the July break, we're going to pass a bill that would allow the president --",
      "Karl: And he's going to sign it?",
      "Graham: Yeah, I think we're in good shape, but he has a waiver. It's up to him how to impose it, but we're trying to get Putin to the table.",
      "Graham: So the ruling was, a single judge cannot stop policy for the entire country -- that's beyond the mandate of a federal district court judge. You still have judicial review, but it has to go up the chain. A single judge can't stop a program for the entire country. And that's a good thing, because people were going judge shopping. The right would go judge --",
      "Karl: I mean, you were going judge-shopping back in the day.",
      "Graham: Everybody goes judge-shopping!",
      "Karl: I'm old enough to remember when you were all in favor of the injunction against DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents) under Obama.",
      "Graham: Totally! I mean -- and I'm here to say, judge-shopping needs to stop. We need to have a system where if you're going to enjoin policy for the nation, it's done at a higher level than a single judge for the left or the right.",
      "Karl: The president went on a tirade against Tillis last night, said he's going to meet with primary challengers, said that he's grandstanding on all of this. What do you make of that? Is it grandstanding?",
      "Graham: I've been on the receiving end of that (laughs).",
      "Karl: Yes, you have.",
      "Graham: He runs hard, and he can forgive. We're trying to do hard things that should be done and have to be done. We're $37 trillion in debt. Medicaid has grown 50% in five years. It's about to take over Medicare. What we've done [in this bill] is limited the growth to 6% for two years, 4% after that, so Medicaid is not cut.",

    "story": [
      "A week later, it's unclear whether and nuclear material was moved beforehand.",
      "A week after President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, the explanations and descriptions of what happened voiced by him, top aides and early intelligence reports paint contrasting pictures of the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program.",
      "While the president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeatedly claimed that Iran's nuclear program has been \"obliterated,\" preliminary assessments \u2014 including from the Pentagon's own intelligence wing \u2014 painted an evolving picture as the week went on.",
      "Trump said he ordered the attack on June 21 to strike a uranium enrichment site located in 300 feet deep in a mountain in Fordo in northwestern Iran, an uranium enrichment site in Natanz and the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center following reports that Iranian officials failed to comply with international nuclear regulations.",
      "And as those early damage assessments cast doubt on the extent to which Iran nuclear program was crippled, several of Trump's top aides and allied lawmakers also appeared to scale back the stated goals of the attack.",
      "Here are some of the accounts and characterizations over the last week.",
      "On Sunday morning, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed Trump's statement from Saturday night, just after the strikes, that the sites had been \"obliterated.\"",
      "\"It was clear we devastated the Iranian nuclear program,\" he added.",
      "Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, however, declined to go as far, saying it would take more time to assess the extent of the damage done.",
      "Hegseth acknowledged that damage assessment was ongoing but stuck by the description he and Trump were using.",
      "\"All of our precision munitions struck where we wanted them to strike and had the desired effect, which means especially the primary target here, we believe we achieved destruction of capabilities there,\" he said.",
      "Officials and inspectors from outside Iran have not been able to gain direct access to the bombed sites to make a first-hand assessment.",
      "Trump officials had a more nuanced take after news reports surfaced Tuesday about an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that said the attack set back Iran's nuclear program only by months.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the leaks of the military's report but did not go as far as to claim that the sites were obliterated.",
      "Instead, he insisted that \"very significant, substantial damage was done\" to key components of Iran's nuclear program, \"and we're just learning more about it.\"",
      "At the same time, Rubio provided more details about the attack, including that the bunker-buster bombs were dropped on ventilation shafts leading deep inside Fordo's heavily fortified facility -- buried, officials and experts said, 200 to 300 feet inside a mountain.",
      "He ultimately acknowledged that it was difficult to get a read on damage inflicted to Fordo at this point, but asserted \"the bottom line is real damage was done.\"",
      "That same day, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claimed in a statement that the three facilities were destroyed.",
      "The director general of the U.N.'s nuclear oversight agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, said Wednesday that he believed some of Iran's enriched uranium had been moved from the sites before the attacks.",
      "Trump refuted that analysis.",
      "\"It would have taken two weeks, maybe. But it's very hard to remove that kind of material, very hard and very dangerous. Plus, they knew we were coming, and if they know we're coming, they're not going to be down there,\" he said Wednesday.",
      "Trump reiterated that the sites and the uranium were buried under rubble and inaccessible, adding that trucks seen in satellite images at the plant before the attack -- which some speculated could have been used to move the nuclear material -- were construction vehicles being used to cover the ventilation shaft openings with protective concrete.",
      "According to the two people familiar with the DIA's classified report, the bombing sealed off the entrances to two of the three nuclear sites targeted in the attack but most of the damage was done to structures above ground, leaving the lower structures intact.",
      "The assessment also found that at least some enriched uranium remained \u2013 possibly moved from the nuclear sites ahead of the blasts.",
      "The next day, on Thursday, Hegseth held a news conference where he slammed the news media over reporting but did not make the same assessment on the nuclear materials.",
      "Asked twice during the briefing if he could be more definitive about whether the enriched uranium was moved before the attack, Hegseth said the Pentagon was \"watching every aspect.\"",
      "At that same Thursday briefing, Caine noted it\u2019s not his job to assess the damage, saying, \"We don\u2019t grade our own homework.\"",
      "Hegseth also highlighted what appeared to be a different goal of the mission, arguing the attack had succeeded because it led to stopping the fighting between Iran and Israel \u2014 rather than the facilities' destruction because it destroyed Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\"We got that peace, that ceasefire, that option because of strength, because of [Trump's] willingness to use American military might that no one else on the planet can do with the kind of planners and operators that the chairman just laid out,\" he said.",
      "Then, on Friday, Trump echoed that sentiment.",
      "\"They put out that fire once that happened, once those bombs got dropped out, that war was over,\" he said.",
      "Still, the president claimed again that the sites were obliterated during a news conference.",
      "\"We finished them off,\" he said, adding, \"I don't believe that they're going to go back into nuclear anytime soon.\"",
      "Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister said on Iranian State TV Thursday, however, the facilities were not destroyed and his country will have leverage in negotiations.",
      "On Capitol Hill on Thursday, after administration officials gave lawmakers a classified briefing on the strikes, Republican lawmakers acknowledged that the U.S. strikes may not have destroyed Iran\u2019s cache of enriched uranium. But they said that wasn't part of the mission.",
      "\"The purpose of the mission was to eliminate certain particular aspects of their nuclear program. Those were eliminated. To get rid of the nuclear material was not part of the mission,\u201d Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., told CNN.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the \"program was obliterated at those three sites,\" but added, \"I don't know where the 900 pounds of highly enriched uranium exists. But it wasn't part of the targets there.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mamdani's win vaulted him into the national conversation overnight.",
      "Speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit in Washington, D.C., an annual evangelical gathering in the nation's capital, Republican leaders showcased an emerging line of attack against Democrats to energize voters and defend their congressional majorities: the ascent of New York state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic socialist on track to become the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City.",
      "Mamdani upset former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday with a campaign that zeroed in on affordability: He pledged to raise taxes to He pledged to raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, help fund city-owned grocery stores, eliminate bus fares and expand public housing initiatives.",
      "His win vaulted him into the national conversation overnight -- Republicans across Washington using it as a new opportunity to depict Democrats as \"radical socialists\" and out of step with the country.",
      "President Donald Trump posted that Mamdani was a \u201c100% Communist Lunatic\u201d the day after the primary.",
      "In his news conference on Friday, Trump said companies looking to the invest in the U.S. are \u201cworried that somebody like this communist from New York, gets elected. I can't believe that's happening. That's a terrible thing for our country, by the way. He's a communist. We're going to a communistic city? That's so bad for New York, but the rest of the country is revolting against it.\u201d",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans' campaign arm, has also been quick to link the national Democratic Party to Mamdani.",
      "Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents a swing district outside New York City and served with Mamdani in the state legislature in Albany, posted on X that Democrats in New York \"will pay the price for this insanity at the ballot box.\"",
      "\"Look at what we just had happen in New York,\" Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley said Friday, adding, \"This is where the Democrats are going. They are open borders, inflationary spending, weak America.\"",
      "While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, some of the party's leaders have stopped short of endorsing him. Some moderate Democrats representing New York's suburbs have criticized him and declined to back his campaign.",
      "A critic of Israel's government, Mamdani has faced allegations of antisemitism over past comments and proposals. In response, he has emphasized policies to combat antisemitism, said that he wants to focus on city issues and has said he supports Israel's right to exist as a state with equal rights for all.",
      "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, in a speech at the same conference as Whatley, also criticized Mamdani while seeking to tie him to Democrats.",
      "\"Listen, the progressive left will not stop. They will not stop trying to lead us down a path to socialism, and therefore we can never stop \u2026 Look what happened in New York. They nominated a mayoral candidate who would make Bernie Sanders blush,\" Youngkin said.",
      "\"But it's not just New York. This is the challenge that we continually face and why we have to continually remind ourselves that elections have consequences,\" he said.",
      "Ralph Reed, a Republican operative and chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, told reporters Friday that Mamdani's victory, and a general election win in November, would put him at the center of the Democratic Party as the leader of the country's largest city.",
      "\"The mayor of New York City is one of the most prominent political figures, not only in the United States, but in the world,\" he said. \"I don't care if you're Rudy Giuliani or Ed Koch or, you know, [Michael] Bloomberg, or you know, whoever it is. It's a big deal. I mean, whether the Democrats would want it or not if he won the primary, he's helping to define that party.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to Mamdani's campaign for comment on the comments made at the conference.",
      "When he was asked by ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott on Wednesday about Republicans seizing on his self-identification as a Democratic socialist to paint all Democrats similarly, Mamdani responded, \"You know, I see that so many New Yorkers, especially the ones we saw [on primary] night, are not actually concerned -- they're excited, by a recognition of the inequality they're facing in their own lives.\"",
      "Some Republicans have launched what some are calling Islamophobic attacks against Mamdani. Born in Uganda, Mamdani, who is a Muslim of Indian descent lived in the United States since he was 7 years old and became a naturalized citizen in 2018.",
      "House Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee wrote on Thursday that he was requesting the Department of Justice open an investigation into Mamdani's citizenship, specifically his naturalization application.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in response to Mamdani's victory, posted a digitally-altered image of the Statue of Liberty covered in a burqa.",
      "Several Muslim Democratic members of Congress have strongly pushed back against Ogles' letter, calling on Democratic leaders to denounce the attacks.",
      "Democratic U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Andr\u00e9 Carson of Indiana, and Lateefah Simon of California wrote in a joint statement on Friday, \"These hateful, Islamophobic, and racist tropes have become so entrenched and normalized in our politics\u2026 They directly contribute to the ongoing dehumanization and violence against Muslim Americans.\"",
      "At a press conference on Friday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has stopped short of endorsing Mamdani but plans to meet with him, called Ogles's effort \"disgusting.\"",
      "U.S. Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., who has strongly criticized Mamdani over his views and endorsed Cuomo in the mayoral primary, wrote on X on Thursday, \"It is no secret that I have profound disagreements with Zohran Mamdani. But every Democrat \u2014 and every decent person \u2014 should speak out with moral clarity against the despicable Islamophobic attacks that have been directed at him.\"",
      "Other House Democrats also came to Mamdani's defense over the comments.",
      "Reed, who said he was not familiar with Ogles or Greene's posts, suggested other Republicans should focus on criticizing Mamdani's policies and legislative record.",
      "\"I haven't even seen it, but I wouldn't think that would be a dominant message,\" he told reporters. \"There's so much material on this guy.\"",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who won her seat last November while Trump carried the state of Michigan on the presidential level, downplayed the disagreements inside the party, and argued that Mamdani's victory in New York underscored voters' focus on the economy across the country.",
      "\"People, just like in November, are still really focused on costs and the economy, and their own kitchen table math, and they're looking for a new generation of leadership,\" Slotkin said on Thursday. \"It reinforces that you may disagree on some key issues, but understanding that people are concerned about their family budget, that is a unifying thing for a coalition.\"",

      "\"Why did they not seek the congressional authorization required by the Constitution for this type of preemptive strike?\" he asked. \"I still haven't seen facts presented to us as a Congress to justify that step, and I certainly haven't seen facts to justify the statement that Donald Trump made that Iran's nuclear program has been completely and totally obliterated.\"",
      "On Friday, the Supreme Court granted a partial stay of nationwide injunctions against President Donald Trump's executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship. Jeffries called the decision \"unfortunate\" and \"reckless.\"",
      "\"If there is any instance where nationwide injunctions are appropriate, it would be in a manner like what we've just experienced in terms of birthright citizenship, which is clearly a part of the Constitution. If you are born as a child in the United States of America, you are a citizen. So, it was a procedural setback that was quite unfortunate, and it was a reckless decision, in my view,\" he said.",
      "He said Democrats will need to \"intensify our efforts\" in district courts or work on a class action suit on behalf of individuals \"adversely impacted.\"",

      "The French city of Cannes is banning cruise ships carrying over 1,000 passengers from its harbor starting next year",
      "PARIS -- The French Riviera resort of Cannes is imposing what its city council calls \u201cdrastic regulation\u201d on cruise ships, banning any vessels carrying more than 1,000 people from its harbor starting next year.",
      "The home of the world's premier film festival is joining a growing global backlash against overtourism, which recently saw uproar over Jeff Bezos\u2019 and Lauren Sanchez' Venice wedding this weekend, water-gun protests in Spain and a surprise strike at the Louvre Museum.",
      "\u201cLess numerous, less big, less polluting and more esthetic\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the aim of Cannes city councilors who voted Friday to introduce new limits on cruise ships in its ports starting Jan. 1. Only ships with fewer than 1,000 passengers will be allowed in the port, with a maximum of 6,000 passengers disembarking per day. Larger ships will be expected to transfer passengers to smaller boats to enter Cannes.",
      "France \u2014 which drew in some 100 million visitors last year, more than any other European country and more than the country\u2019s population \u2014 is on the front line of efforts to balance economic benefits of tourism with environmental concerns while managing ever-growing crowds.",
      "\u201cCannes has become a major cruise ship destination, with real economic benefits. It\u2019s not about banning cruise ships, but about regulating, organizing, setting guidelines for their navigation,\u201d Mayor David Lisnard said in a statement.",
      "Cruise operators have called such restrictions damaging for destinations and for passengers.",
      "Two cruise ships were scheduled to dock in Cannes on Sunday, each bigger than the upcoming 1,000-passenger limit and with a combined capacity of more than 7,000 people. Their owners did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new restrictions.",
      "The nearby Mediterranean city of Nice announced limits on cruise ships earlier this year, as have some other European cities.",

      "Group and solo travelers are trickling into Afghanistan by plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles",
      "KABUL, Afghanistan -- By plane, motorbike, camper van and even on bicycles, tourists are beginning to discover Afghanistan, with solo travelers and tour groups gradually venturing into a country that until recently was wracked by war.",
      "And the country\u2019s Taliban government, which seized power more than three years ago but has yet to be formally recognized by any other nation, is more than happy to welcome them.",
      "\u201cThe Afghan people are warm and welcoming and wish to host tourists from other countries and engage with them,\u201d Deputy Minister of Tourism Qudratullah Jamal told The Associated Press in an early June interview. \u201cTourism brings many benefits to a country. We have considered those benefits and aim for our nation to take full advantage of them.\u201d",
      "Tourism is a vital, multi-billion-dollar industry for many countries.",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s isolation on the international stage, largely because of the Taliban\u2019s restrictions on women and girls, has left much of its 41 million people mired in poverty. As it struggles to attract foreign investment, the lucrative potential of tourism is far from lost on the government.",
      "\u201cWe are currently earning a considerable amount of revenue from this industry, and we are hopeful it will grow even more in the future,\u201d Jamal said, noting money spent by visitors can reach more layers of society than revenue from other industries. \u201cWe are optimistic this sector will evolve into a large economy, bringing significant benefits. It plays an important role in strengthening our national economy.\u201d",
      "Tourist visas are quick and easy to obtain and flights from major transit hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul operate several times a week. The government has even set up a training institute for men \u2014 and it is only for men \u2014 seeking jobs in the hospitality and tourism sector.",
      "While visitor numbers are still very much a trickle rather than a flood, they are increasing. Nearly 9,000 foreign tourists visited Afghanistan last year, while nearly 3,000 people visited in the first three months of this year, Jamal said.",
      "Four decades of near-continuous conflict kept nearly all vacationers away from this landlocked country of towering mountains, deep gorges and millennia of history.",
      "The Taliban\u2019s takeover from a U.S.-backed government in August 2021 stunned the world and sent thousands of Afghans fleeing. But with the insurgency over, the bloodshed from frequent bombings and suicide attacks all but ended too.",
      "Attacks still occur, however. An Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan remains active and gunmen killed six people, including three Spanish tourists, in a May 2024 attack in Bamiyan, one of the country\u2019s main tourist attractions where centuries-old giant Buddhas carved into the cliffs were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.",
      "While Western countries still advise against travel to Afghanistan, a drop in violence from the two decades of U.S.-led military presence is indisputable, as the government is keen to point out.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan has gone through many years of war and hardship. Now, we want tourists to come and see the true traditions and customs of Afghans, to understand Afghan life, creativity and resilience,\u201d Jamal said, noting there was \u201ccomprehensive security across Afghanistan.\u201d",
      "Critics question the ethics of foreigners visiting Afghanistan for pleasure when its government discriminates so heavily against half the country\u2019s population.",
      "Education beyond primary school level is banned for girls and women and few professions are open to them. Women cannot enter parks, gardens or gyms.",
      "Beauty salons are forbidden. Authorities dictate how women dress and have demanded they cover their faces in public, a decree still flouted by many, particularly in Kabul.",
      "Some visitors say they contemplated the ethics, but ultimately wanted to see the situation for themselves.",
      "French-Peruvian Illary Gomez said she and her British partner, James Liddiard, debated for about a year whether to drive through Afghanistan as part of their U.K.-to-Japan camper van journey.",
      "\u201cSome things didn\u2019t feel morally right,\u201d she said.",
      "But once here, they said they found a warm, hospitable and welcoming people and beautiful landscapes. They didn\u2019t feel their presence was any form of support for the Taliban.",
      "By traveling, \u201cyou put money in the hands of the people, not the government,\u201d Liddiard said.",
      "The treatment of women is particularly sensitive for government officials. Jamal declined to comment on the subject beyond saying male and female visitors were welcome.",
      "\u201cThose who respect our laws and traditions have already come and can continue to come,\u201d he said.",
      "While most restrictions are strictly enforced on Afghan women, they are far more relaxed for foreigners. Although they must still wear a headscarf in public, foreign women are more likely to gain entry into some restricted areas such as parks and are rarely asked to cover their faces in public.",
      "Opening the country to foreign visitors was also a way of building bridges, Jamal said.",
      "\u201cIt is a great way to promote interaction between the people of different countries. It helps build international relations and is also beneficial for trade,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen foreigners come here, Afghans also learn a lot from them. In addition to expanding commerce, tourism also helps foster mutual understanding, cultural exchange and strengthens talents as people learn from one another.\u201d",
      "A foreign traveler seeing the country with his own eyes \u201ccreates closeness, builds connections and fosters trust among people,\u201d Jamal said. \u201cThey will respect each other\u2019s culture and the distance between peoples will diminish.",
      "\u201cSo this is not just economic development; it also brings spiritual and political benefits,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "No state may have more to lose than Georgia as Republicans in Congress look to gut federal subsidies that aid both the solar and electric vehicle industries",
      "CARTERSVILLE, Ga. -- When two South Korean companies announced a multibillion-dollar investment to build solar panel and electric battery factories in northwest Georgia, federal subsidies helped close a deal to diversify the local economy.",
      "The factories promised thousands of new jobs, transforming the manufacturing base in Cartersville, once a cotton mill town before an Anheuser-Busch brewery arrived in the 1990s and a tire plant in 2006.",
      "But now Republicans in Congress want to gut the subsidies for projects across the country in a tax cut bill likely days from final passage. President Donald Trump\u2019s signature legislation could harm Cartersville despite it being in overwhelmingly Republican Bartow County, which backed Trump with 75% of the vote all three times he appeared on the ballot.",
      "Both companies say they\u2019re continuing their buildout plans. But Steve Taylor, a Republican who is Bartow County's lone elected commissioner, says ending the tax credits would be \u201ca little concerning.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose companies came and it gave us a completely different type of industry and manufacturing for our community,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "By some measures, no state may have more to lose than Georgia from such cuts in Trump's \u201c Big Beautiful Bill.\u201d Top Georgia Republicans have been mostly silent, while Georgia\u2019s two Democratic U.S. senators are staunchly opposed.",
      "\u201cA vote for this bill is a vote against Georgia\u2019s economy and a vote that will put so much of what we\u2019ve worked so hard to achieve at risk\u201d U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff told The Associated Press.",
      "And few towns have more to lose than Cartersville, the Bartow County seat about 35 miles (55 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta. As the county transforms from rural to suburban, leaders foresee an economic boost from the $5 billion battery factory that Hyundai Motor Group and SK On are building, as well as the $2.3 billion solar panel plant belonging to Qcells, a unit of Hanwha Solutions. Both plants pledge to pay workers an average of $53,000 a year.",
      "Georgia\u2019s huge inrush of clean energy projects had already begun before 2022, when then-President Joe Biden signed his signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act. But if anything, that rush accelerated. The 33 additional projects announced by the end of 2024 were the most nationwide, according to E2, an environmental business group. Exact figures differ, but projects in Georgia top $20 billion, pledging more than 25,000 jobs.",
      "Buyers of Qcells solar panels get a 40% federal tax credit, including a 10% bonus for domestic content, which would go away under the bill. Qcells itself would still get production tax credits for panels it started producing last year in Cartersville. The bill would also tax companies that buy panels or components from some foreign countries including China. That could help Qcells, but wouldn't aid domestic producers as much as the domestic content bonus.",
      "When the 1,900-job plant is complete, it will take refined polysilicon, cast it into ingots and then thinly slice ingots into the wafers that become solar cells. Qcells says controlling its own supply chain will let it work more efficiently. Those additional steps would earn the company additional tax credits.",
      "Scott Moskowitz, vice president of market strategy and industry affairs for Qcells, said the company built its first American factory up the road in Dalton during the first Trump administration in response to Trump's protectionist trade policy. Moskowitz argues that a quick curtailment of federal subsidies undercuts Trump's goal of bolstering domestic manufacturing, pushing buyers back to Chinese-controlled producers.",
      "Some local Republicans are expressing alarm, with 16 GOP state legislators imploring Congress in a June 17 letter to preserve tax breaks for solar panels.",
      "\u201cWe urge you not to weaken the tax credits, as doing so would only harm the manufacturing renaissance in Georgia while creating opportunities for Chinese companies to take over the solar industry,\u201d wrote the Georgia lawmakers, led by Republican state Rep. Matthew Gambill of Cartersville.",
      "Some argue it's unfair for Congress to pull the rug out after companies relied on the promise of federal support to invest huge sums.",
      "\u201cI would like to think that from a business perspective that when you have agreements in place that you carry those out to fulfillment,\" Cartersville Mayor Matt Santini said.",
      "Clean energy projects have overwhelmingly located in Republican-held congressional districts, with a report by Atlas Public Policy finding GOP districts host 77% of planned spending.",
      "But Republican U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk, who lives in Bartow County, praised the cuts when they passed the House in May, saying the bill would \u201cunleash American energy stifled by the Democrats\u2019 Green New scam\u201d and lauding expansion of oil, gas and coal production on federal lands.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp says he's staying out of the debate.",
      "\u201cOur position is that Congress needs to be the one to decide the future of the IRA,\" said Kemp spokesperson Garrison Douglas.",
      "Kemp loves green energy investments and jobs, and even declared that his goal is to make Georgia the \u201celectric mobility capital of America.\u201d But Kemp and Ossoff clash over who should get credit for Georgia\u2019s green energy boom. Kemp sharply disputes that the Biden-era incentives spurred the flood of investment, saying many industries were already on their way before the Inflation Reduction Act was passed.",
      "Unlike his current silence, Kemp vociferously opposed some domestic content requirements that made it hard for Hyundai to access the same tax credits as unionized U.S.-based automakers.",
      "\u201cJust generally speaking, the Inflation Reduction Act picked winners and losers, and we saw that negatively impact our partners,\" Douglas said.",
      "All nine of Georgia's Republican House members voted to support the bill, including U.S. Rep Buddy Carter, who earlier signed a letter supporting green energy subsidies. Carter, who is seeking the GOP nomination to oppose Ossoff for Senate in 2026, represents a coastal district that includes a $7.6 billion Hyundai plant in Ellabell that started production last year.",
      "Hyundai wants to make batteries at what would be a 3,500-employee plant near Cartersville so that Hyundai and Kia buyers can fully take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. Those credits would end six months after the bill is enacted under the current version.",
      "The company is publicly sidestepping the current legislative fight. But with American demand for electric vehicles slow to take off, Hyundai now says it will also build gas-electric hybrid vehicles in Ellabell, once projected to make only electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe remain focused on electrification because we believe it represents a significant long-term opportunity,\u201d Hyundai spokesperson Michael Stewart said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, our business is driven by consumer demand, which is why we continue to offer a full range of powertrains.\u201d",
      "Bartow County leaders say it's in everyone's interest to keep the projects on solid footing and that jobs should outweigh politics.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that people are lining up along party lines over this topic,\u201d Santini said.",
      "But Ossoff says partisanship is motivating many Georgia Republicans to turn their backs on the state's economic interests.",
      "\u201cFor national Republicans right now, loyalty to Trump is more important than anything else, and this is what Trump says he wants,\" Ossoff said.",

      "A group of Environmental Protection Agency employees has published a declaration of dissent to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin over the agency's leadership and policies",
      "A group of Environmental Protection Agency employees on Monday published a declaration of dissent from the agency's policies under the Trump administration, saying they \u201cundermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "More than 170 EPA employees put their names to the document, with about 100 more signing anonymously out of fear of retaliation, according to Jeremy Berg, a former editor-in-chief of Science magazine who is not an EPA employee but was among non-EPA scientists or academics to also sign. The latter figure includes over 70 Nobel laureates.",
      "The letter represents rare public criticism from agency employees who could face blowback for speaking out against a weakening of funding and federal support for climate, environmental and health science. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health made a similar move earlier in June.",
      "\"Since the Agency\u2019s founding in 1970, EPA has accomplished (its) mission by leveraging science, funding, and expert staff in service to the American people. Today, we stand together in dissent against the current administration\u2019s focus on harmful deregulation, mischaracterization of previous EPA actions, and disregard for scientific expertise,\" the letter read.",
      "Agency spokespeople did not immediately respond Monday to messages seeking comment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really sad. This agency, that was a superhero for me in my youth, we're not living up to our ideals under this administration. And I really want us to,\u201d said Amelia Hertzberg, an environmental protection specialist at the EPA who has been on administrative leave since February from the Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, while the administration works to close down her department.",
      "Hertzberg's work focused on the most vulnerable groups impacted by pollution: pregnant and nursing people, young children and babies, the elderly, people with preexisting and chronic health conditions and people living in communities exposed to higher levels of pollution. That wasn't supposed to be controversial, but it's become so in this political climate, she said.",
      "\u201cAmericans should be able to drink their water and breathe their air without being poisoned. And if they aren\u2019t, then our government is failing,\u201d she said.",
      "Berg, who also directed the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH from 2003-2011, said the dissent isn't motivated by partisan criticism. He said the employees hope it will help the EPA get back to the mission for which it was established \u2014 which \u201conly matters if you breathe air and drink water.\"",
      "The letter outlines what the EPA employees see as five main concerns: undermining public trust; ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters; reversing EPA's progress in America's most vulnerable communities; dismantling the Office of Research and Development; and promoting a culture of fear, forcing staff to choose between their livelihood and well-being.",
      "Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.",
      "Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA\u2019s research and development office as part of his push to slash their budget and gut their study of climate change and environmental justice. And he\u2019s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an Associated Press examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die,\u201d said Carol Greider, a Nobel laureate and professor of molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who also signed the letter. She described last week's East Coast heat wave as evidence of the ways people are feeling the effects of climate change. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have scientists at the EPA to understand how what we do that goes into the air affects our health, more people are going to die,\u201d she added.",
      "Berg said the declarations of dissent from both the NIH and EPA employees are noteworthy because they represent scientists speaking out as their careers are on the line. Even non-agency employees have to consider whether the government will withdraw research funding.",
      "Greider, asked about fears of repercussions or retaliation, said she's \u201cliving the repercussions of everything.\u201d She regularly meets with graduate students who are worried about pursuing scientific careers as labs lose funding.",
      "It's a long-term problem if we aren't supporting the next generation of scientists, she said: \"That\u2019s decades worth of loss.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A poll shows only 36% of Democrats say they\u2019re \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people",
      "WASHINGTON -- Only 36% of Democrats say they're \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American, according to a new Gallup poll, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people.",
      "The findings are a stark illustration of how many \u2014 but not all \u2014 Americans have felt less of a sense of pride in their country over the past decade. The split between Democrats and Republicans, at 56 percentage points, is at its widest since 2001. That includes all four years of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults who are part of Generation Z, which is defined as those born from 1997 to 2012, expressed a high level of pride in being American in Gallup surveys conducted in the past five years, on average. That's compared with about 6 in 10 Millennials \u2014 those born between 1980 and 1996 \u2014 and at least 7 in 10 U.S. adults in older generations.",
      "\u201cEach generation is less patriotic than the prior generation, and Gen Z is definitely much lower than anybody else,\u201d said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. \u201cBut even among the older generations, we see that they're less patriotic than the ones before them, and they've become less patriotic over time. That's primarily driven by Democrats within those generations.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s decline in national pride has been a slow erosion, with a steady downtick in Gallup's data since January 2001, when the question was first asked.",
      "Even during the tumultuous early years of the Iraq War, the vast majority of U.S. adults, whether Republican or Democrat, said they were \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American. At that point, about 9 in 10 were \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d proud to be American. That remained high in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but the consensus around American pride slipped in the years that followed, dropping to about 8 in 10 in 2006 and continuing a gradual decline.",
      "Now, 58% of U.S. adults say that, in a downward shift that\u2019s been driven almost entirely by Democrats and independents. The vast majority of Republicans continue to say they're proud to be American.",
      "Independents\u2019 pride in their national identity hit a new low in the most recent survey, at 53%, largely following that pattern of gradual decline.",
      "Democrats\u2019 diminished pride in being American is more clearly linked to Trump\u2019s time in office. When Trump first entered the White House, in 2017, about two-thirds of Democrats said they were proud to be American. That had fallen to 42% by 2020, just before Trump lost reelection to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "But while Democrats\u2019 sense of national pride rebounded when Biden took office, it didn\u2019t go back to its pre-Trump levels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a Trump story,\" Jones said. \u201cSomething else is going on, and I think it\u2019s just younger generations coming in and not being as patriotic as older people.\u201d",
      "Other recent polling shows that Democrats and independents are less likely than Republicans to say that expressing patriotism is important or to feel a sense of pride in their national leaders.",
      "Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans in a 2024 SSRS poll said they believed patriotism has a positive impact on the United States, with Democrats more divided: 45% said patriotism had a positive impact on the country, while 37% said it was negative.",
      "But a more general sense of discontent was clear on both sides of the aisle earlier this year, when a CNN/SSRS poll found that fewer than 1 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said \u201cproud\u201d described the way they felt about politics in America today.",
      "In that survey, most Americans across the political spectrum said they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d or \u201cfrustrated\u201d with the country\u2019s politics.",

      "A hearing in Pennsylvania will determine if several witnesses will have to testify at a former criminal justice student's trial on charges he stabbed to death four college students in Idaho in 2022",
      "Several potential defense witnesses from Bryan Kohberger 's home state of Pennsylvania are expected in court Monday for a hearing on whether they must testify at the former criminal justice student's trial for the stabbing deaths of four college students in Idaho.",
      "Kohberger's trial on four counts of murder and one count of burglary is on track to begin Aug. 11 in Boise, Idaho, after a judge declined his lawyer's request for a delay last week.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.",
      "Monday's hearing in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, concerns requests by Kohberger's lawyers that a Monroe County judge order seven people to testify, although it's not clear how the potential witnesses fit into the case. One of the seven agreed to cancel her hearing, and an order was issued last week summoning her for trial.",
      "News organizations have reported that the group includes school employees, a jail guard, a boxing gym owner and an auto shop worker. Phone messages seeking comment were left for several of them last week.",
      "The 30-year-old Kohberger, who was arrested at his parents' home in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, weeks after the November 2022 killings, is accused of sneaking into a rental home in Moscow, Idaho, not far from the University of Idaho campus, and attacking Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves.",
      "The slayings shocked the rural Idaho community and neighboring Pullman, Washington, where Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University.",
      "In a court filing, his lawyers said Kohberger was on a long drive by himself around the time the four were killed.",
      "Kohberger was silent during his arraignment, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "A gag order has largely kept attorneys, investigators and others from speaking publicly about the investigation or trial. A person answering the phone last week at the office of his lawyer, Anne Taylor, said the defense team had no comment about the Monday hearing or the case.",
      "Another one of the seven potential witnesses has told lawyers she is traveling and unavailable Monday, so a hearing on whether to compel her testimony was rescheduled for July 7.",

      "Records reviewed by The Washington Post show that Hernandez Reyes has been released early from federal prison to a halfway house and has been given permission to stay in the U.S. for at least a year.",
      "Prosecutors have identified Hernandez Reyes as the \u201cfirst cooperator\u201d in the case against Abrego, according to court filings. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that Hernandez owned the SUV that Abrego Garcia was allegedly using to smuggle migrants when the Tennessee Highway Patrol stopped him in 2022. That traffic stop is at the center of the criminal investigation against Abrego Garcia.",
      "Hernandez Reyes is among a handful of cooperating witnesses who could help the administration deport Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a construction worker who had been living in Maryland, became a flashpoint over Trump\u2019s hard-line immigration policies when he was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador in March. Facing mounting pressure and a Supreme Court order, the administration returned him this month to face the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \u201cpreposterous.\u201d",

    "summary": "Flint, Michigan, is still working on replacing all of its lead pipes",
    "story": [
      "Flint, Michigan, is still working on replacing all of its lead pipes",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- Jeffrey Bell watched as crews dug up and replaced neighbors\u2019 lead water pipes, hoping his mother\u2019s house would be next. Workers told him it wasn\u2019t on their list but probably assigned to another contractor.",
      "With Flint's lead pipe replacement program winding down this year, Bell and his elderly mother worried the home they share was forgotten. Betty Bell repeatedly called the city while continuing to buy bottled drinking water, as she had for years. Finally someone called to say the water line was fine \u2014 records indicate it was checked in 2017. But the Bells hadn't known that, exemplifying residents\u2019 confusion over a process marred by delays and poor communication.",
      "\u201cI have even more questions now,\u201d Jeffrey Bell said.",
      "About a decade after Flint\u2019s water crisis caused national outrage, replacement of lead water pipes still isn\u2019t finished. Although the city recently said it completed work required under a legal settlement, the agreement didn\u2019t cover vacant homes and allowed owners to refuse, potentially leaving hundreds of pipes in the ground. The state agreed to oversee work on those properties and says it\u2019s determined to finish by fall.",
      "Flint\u2019s missteps offer lessons for municipalities that face a recently imposed federal mandate to replace their own lead service lines. The Trump administration is expected to soon tell a federal appeals court if it will stand by that mandate.",
      "\u201cI think other cities are racing not to be Flint,\u201d said Margie Kelly, a spokesperson with the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, which reached a settlement with the city to force it to replace lead pipes.",
      "Flint\u2019s crisis was set in motion in 2014, when a state-appointed emergency manager ended a contract with Detroit\u2019s water system and switched to the Flint River to save money. But the state didn't require treatment to prevent corrosion that caused lead to leach into the water.",
      "High levels of lead eventually were detected in drinking water and children\u2019s blood. Outbreaks of Legionnaires\u2019 disease that killed a dozen people were also linked, in part, to the city\u2019s water.",
      "In 2017, Flint entered into a settlement requiring it to replace all lead pipes and fix dug-up yards for free within three years. Funds were directed first toward homes with known lead lines at the NRDC's insistence, which meant workers couldn't tackle neighborhoods systematically. And finding those homes proved challenging because many records were missing or inaccurate \u2014 some handwritten on notecards dating to the early 1900s.",
      "\u201cThe city\u2019s overall management of the program was ineffective,\u201d and it could have better coordinated work geographically, said Sarah Tallman, an attorney with the NRDC.",
      "That stalled the program and, ultimately, the city had to check every pipe anyway. COVID-19 also slowed work.",
      "Flint Department of Public Works Director Kenneth Miller, who was hired last year, said the city didn\u2019t know how many homeowners had opted out of lead pipe replacement or how many properties had simply been missed as contractors came and went.",
      "\u201cJust like any other organization, people get lax, people stop doing things, people get laid off and the person that used to do it doesn\u2019t do it anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "Because the city didn\u2019t keep accurate records of repairs, a judge ordered officials to visually check thousands of properties that had been excavated.",
      "Yards torn up by contractors sometimes sat that way for months or years. For months, Danyele Darrough\u2019s lawn was a mess and the sidewalk and driveway were covered, she said. Grass seed that workers applied never grew. Finally this spring, nearly three years later, she bought bags of topsoil and seed to fix her lawn herself.",
      "\u201cIt was like, yeah, we knew it; we couldn\u2019t trust them,\u201d said Darrough.",
      "Miller said the city now has robust data management, which he recommends to other communities tackling lead lines.",
      "Steep population loss left thousands of vacant homes that will require contractors to cap lead lines where they\u2019re found, said Eric Oswald, drinking water director at Michigan\u2019s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.",
      "\u201cThe state and the city wanted to absolutely make sure that ... we leave no stone unturned,\u201d he said.",
      "In Flint, government at every level caused the lead crisis or delayed fixing it, according to an EPA inspector general report. The scandal damaged trust in government \u2014 nearly 700 Flint homeowners declined free lead pipe replacement, the NRDC said.",
      "Flint finally adopted an ordinance last year to prevent homeowners from opting out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get across the finish line unless you\u2019ve got something to enforce,\u201d Oswald said. Benton Harbor, across the state, implemented a similar provision early on, helping its work move smoothly.",
      "Now officials are working from a list of more than 4,000 properties where there could be a lead line, sending letters and making in-person visits to homes, if needed. Miller said he hopes the outreach will show that customer service is now a priority, but it will take time to rebuild trust.",
      "Some also distrust the Environmental Protection Agency, which in May lifted a long-standing emergency order for Flint water. The agency said it\u2019s now safe to drink from the tap after years of tests showing sharply reduced lead levels.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d resident Aonie Gilcreast said at a recent community gathering. \u201cWe don\u2019t trust the system\u201d because officials have said \u201ctime after time after time .... that everything was fine.\u201d",
      "As other cities and towns start replacing their own lead pipes \u2014 there are roughly 9 million in the U.S. \u2014 one thing should be top of mind, experts say: Digging them up isn\u2019t just a construction job, but also a test of community trust.",
      "To replace the lines that connect the water main in the street to homes, workers usually must dig in the street and yard, and enter the home. When residents trust local government, they\u2019re more willing to grant that access.",
      "\u201cWith lead, as with everything else, the first time people hear from their water utility can\u2019t be when there is a concern,\u201d said Greg Kail, spokesperson at utility industry group American Water Works Association. Instead, it is important for utilities to reach out to residents about what they plan to do and enlist trusted community groups in the effort.",
      "Newark, New Jersey, avoided Flint's pitfalls when facing its own lead crisis.",
      "In 2019, about two years after elevated levels were revealed and with funds available, the mayor said the city would replace more than 20,000 lead pipes at no cost to residents \u2014 and do it within three years. But a challenge soon emerged: Newark has lots of renters who couldn\u2019t approve the work.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t get into the houses. We couldn\u2019t find the owners,\u201d said Kareem Adeem, Newark\u2019s water and sewer director. \u201cThey don\u2019t live there. They had no interest in taking care of the lead service line.\u201d",
      "So the city passed an ordinance making lead pipe removals mandatory and giving renters permission to approve the work.",
      "Then contractors moved quickly through the city block by block \u2014 a lesson learned from Flint.",
      "For the most stubborn holdouts, officials told them when they\u2019d start replacement work and said they'd turn the water off until the resident allowed them to complete it. The threat was enough. They never had to actually turn off anybody\u2019s water, Adeem said.",
      "Sometimes, people would recognize Adeem from TV and he could start a conversation \u2014 a crack in a resident\u2019s determination to say no. He worked with trusted community groups, too.",
      "And the decision that ensured people\u2019s property was cleaned up afterward? The contractors weren\u2019t fully paid until they finished the work and fixed any damage.",

    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani is the expected Democratic nominee for New York City mayor.",
      "NEW YORK -- In choosing Zohran Mamdani as their candidate for mayor, Democrats in America\u2019s most Jewish city have nominated an outspoken critic of Israel, alarming some in New York's Jewish community and signaling a sea change in the priorities of one of the party's most loyal voting groups.",
      "The 33-year-old democratic socialist's surprisingly strong performance against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo makes clear that taking a stance against Israel is no longer disqualifying in a Democratic primary. The state Assembly member has declined to support the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state, refused to denounce the term \u201cglobal intifada\" and supports an organized effort to put economic pressure on Israel through boycotts and other tactics.",
      "Yet he excelled in the city with the largest Jewish population outside of Israel, and with the support of many Jewish voters.",
      "Mamdani's success reflects the ideological realignment of many American Jews since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that led to Israel's invasion of Gaza. Many Democratic voters, including Jews, have grown dismayed by Israel\u2019s conduct in the war and are deeply critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. That is especially true among younger, more progressive voters, many of whom have rejected the once-broadly accepted notion that anti-Israel sentiment is inherently antisemitic.",
      "For others, Mamdani's showing has spurred new fears about safety and the waning influence of Jewish voters in a city where anti-Jewish hate crime has surged. Last year, Jews were the target of more than half of the hate crimes in the city.",
      "\u201cDefinitely people are concerned,\" said Rabbi Shimon Hecht, of Congregation B\u2019nai Jacob in Brooklyn, who said he has heard from congregants in recent days who hope Mamdani will be beaten in the November general election, where he will face Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and possibly Cuomo, if he stays in the race.",
      "\u201cI think like every upsetting election, it\u2019s a wake-up call for people,\u201d Hecht said. \u201cI strongly believe that he will not be elected as our next mayor, but it's going to take a lot of uniting among the Jewish people and others who are concerned about these issues. We have to unify.\"",
      "Veteran New York Democratic political strategist Hank Sheinkopf put it more bluntly, predicting a hasty exodus of religious Jews from the city and a decline in long-standing Jewish influence that would be replicated elsewhere.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the end of Jewish New York as we know it,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cNew York is a petri dish for national Democratic politics. And what happened here is what will likely happen in cities across the country.\"",
      "Mamdani\u2019s top Democratic rival, the former governor, had called antisemitism and support for Israel \"the most important issue\u201d of the campaign.",
      "Mamdani's backers repeatedly accused Cuomo of trying to weaponize the issue. Many drew parallels to the way Republican President Donald Trump has cast any criticism of Israel's actions as antisemitic, claiming Jews who vote for Democrats \u201chate Israel\" and their own religion.",
      "For some Mamdani supporters, the election results signaled a rejection by voters of one of Cuomo\u2019s arguments: that an upstart socialist with pro-Palestinian views posed a threat to New York\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "Many were focused on issues such as affordability in a notoriously expensive city, or flat-out opposed to Cuomo, who was forced to resign in disgrace amid sexual harassment allegations.",
      "Aiyana Leong Knauer, a 35-year-old Brooklyn bartender who is Jewish and backed Mamdani, said the vote represented \u201cNew Yorkers, many of them Jewish, saying we care more about having an affordable city than sowing division.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of us take really deep offense to our history being weaponized against us,\u201d she said. \u201cJewish people all over the world have well-founded fears for their safety, but Jews in New York are safe overall.\u201d",
      "Others agreed with Mamdani's views on Israel.",
      "Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, an anti-Zionist, progressive group that worked on Mamdani's behalf, said Mamdani \u201cwas actually pretty popular among a lot of Jewish voters.\"",
      "\u201cThat is not in spite of his support for Palestinian rights. That is because of his support for Palestinian rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has been a massive rupture within the Jewish community and more and more Jews of all generations, but especially younger generations,\u201d she said, now refuse to be tied to what they see as a rogue government committing atrocities against civilians.",
      "Polls show support for Israel has declined since the war began. Overall, a slight majority of Americans now express a \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d unfavorable opinion of Israel, according to a March Pew Research Center poll, compared with 42% in 2022. Democrats\u2019 views are particularly negative, with nearly 70% holding an unfavorable opinion versus less than 40% of Republicans.",
      "Mamdani's wasn't the only race where Israel was on voters' minds.",
      "In Brooklyn, City Councilwoman Shahana Hanif, who represents Park Slope and surrounding areas, drew criticism for her Palestinian advocacy. Some said she had failed to respond forcefully to antisemitic incidents in the district.",
      "Yet Hanif, the first Muslim woman elected to the City Council, easily beat her top challenger, Maya Kornberg, who is Jewish, despite an influx of money from wealthy, pro-Israel groups and donors.",
      "That outcome dismayed Ramon Maislen, a developer who launched Brooklyn BridgeBuilders to oppose Hanif's reelection and said antisemitism did not seem to resonate with voters.",
      "\u201cWe were very disappointed with our neighbors' response,\" he said.",
      "While campaigning against Hanif, he said he was routinely screamed at by residents and accused of supporting genocide.",
      "\u201cI think that those of us in the Jewish community that are attuned to that are cognizant that there's been some kind of cultural sea change that\u2019s occurring,\" he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a legitimatization of hatred that isn\u2019t happening in any other liberal or progressive space.\"",
      "Mamdani has repeatedly pledged to fight antisemitism, including during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\u201d where he was grilled on his stance. He was joined on the show by city comptroller and fellow candidate Brad Lander, the city's highest-ranking Jewish official, who had cross-endorsed him. He has also said he would increase funding for anti-hate crime programming by 800%.",
      "But many of his comments have angered Jewish groups and officials, most notably his refusal to disavow the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\" which has been used as a slogan in recent protests. Many Jews see it as a call to violence against Israeli civilians. In a podcast interview, Mamdani said the phrase captured a \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights.\"",
      "Given another opportunity to condemn the phrase, Mamdani on Sunday told NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that it was not his role to police speech and he pledged to be a mayor who \u201cprotects Jewish New Yorkers and lives up to that commitment through the work that I do.\u201d",
      "Mamdani also supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which aims to pressure governments, schools and other institutions to boycott Israeli products, divest from companies that support the country, and impose sanctions. The Anti-Defamation League calls it antisemitic and part of a broader campaign to \"delegitimize and isolate the State of Israel.\u201d",
      "Mamdani has also said that, as mayor, he would arrest Netanyahu if the Israeli leader tried to enter the city.",
      "The ADL in a statement Thursday warned candidates and their supporters not to use \"language playing into dangerous antisemitic canards that time and time again have been used to incite hatred and violence against Jews.\u201d",
      "In his victory speech, Mamdani alluded to the criticism he'd received and said he would not abandon his beliefs. But he also said he would \"reach further to understand the perspectives of those with whom I disagree and to wrestle deeply with those disagreements.\u201d",

    "summary": "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
    "story": [
      "Some Iranians are getting arrested by immigration authorities after living decades in the United States",
      "Mandonna \u201cDonna\u201d Kashanian lived in the United States for 47 years, married a U.S. citizen and raised their daughter. She was gardening in the yard of her New Orleans home when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers handcuffed and took her away, her family said.",
      "Kashanian arrived in 1978 on a student visa and applied for asylum, fearing retaliation for her father's support of the U.S.-backed shah. She lost her bid, but she was allowied to remain with her husband and child if she checked in regularly with immigration officials, her husband and daughter said. She complied, once checking in from South Carolina during Hurricane Katrina. She is now being held at an immigration detention center in Basile, Louisiana, while her family tries to get information.",
      "Other Iranians are also getting arrested by immigration authorities after decades in the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security won't say how many people they've arrested, but U.S. military strikes on Iran have fueled fears that there is more to come.",
      "\u201cSome level of vigilance, of course, makes sense, but what it seems like ICE has done is basically give out an order to round up as many Iranians as you can, whether or not they\u2019re linked to any threat and then arrest them and deport them, which is very concerning,\u201d said Ryan Costello, policy director of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group.",
      "Homeland Security did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Kashanian's case but have been touting arrests of Iranians. The department announced the arrests of at least 11 Iranians on immigration violations during the weekend of the U.S. missile strikes. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, without elaborating, that it arrested seven Iranians at a Los Angeles-area address that \u201chas been repeatedly used to harbor illegal entrants linked to terrorism.\"",
      "The department \"has been full throttle on identifying and arresting known or suspected terrorists and violent extremists that illegally entered this country, came in through Biden\u2019s fraudulent parole programs or otherwise,\u201d spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said of the 11 arrests. She didn't offer any evidence of terrorist or extremist ties. Her comment on parole programs referred to President Joe Biden's expanded legal pathways to entry, which his successor, Donald Trump, shut down.",
      "Russell Milne, Kashanian\u2019s husband, said his wife is not a threat. Her appeal for asylum was complicated because of \u201cevents in her early life,\" he explained. A court found an earlier marriage of hers to be fraudulent.",
      "But over four decades, Kashanian, 64, built a life in Louisiana. The couple met when she was bartending as a student in the late 1980s. They married and had a daughter. She volunteered with Habitat for Humanity, filmed Persian cooking tutorials on YouTube and was a grandmother figure to the children next door.",
      "The fear of deportation always hung over the family, Milne said, but he said his wife did everything that was being asked of her.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s meeting her obligations,\" Milne said. \"She\u2019s retirement age. She\u2019s not a threat. Who picks up a grandmother?\u201d",
      "While Iranians have been crossing the border illegally for years, especially since 2021, they have faced little risk of being deported to their home countries due to severed diplomatic relations with the U.S. That seems to no longer be the case.",
      "The Trump administration has deported hundreds of people, including Iranians, to countries other than their own in an attempt to circumvent diplomatic hurdles with governments that won\u2019t take their people back. During Trump\u2019s second term, countries including El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama have taken back noncitizens from the U.S.",
      "The administration has asked the Supreme Court to clear the way for several deportations to South Sudan, a war-ravaged country with which it has no ties, after the justices allowed deportations to countries other than those noncitizens came from.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol arrested Iranians 1,700 times at the Mexican border from October 2021 through November 2024, according to the most recent public data available. The Homeland Security Department reported that about 600 Iranians overstayed visas as business or exchange visitors, tourists and students in the 12-month period through September 2023, the most recent data reports.",
      "Iran was one of 12 countries subject to a U.S. travel ban that took effect this month. Some fear ICE's growing deportation arrests will be another blow.",
      "In Oregon, an Iranian man was detained by immigration agents this past week while driving to the gym. He was picked up roughly two weeks before he was scheduled for a check-in at ICE offices in Portland, according to court documents filed by his attorney, Michael Purcell.",
      "The man, identified in court filings as S.F., has lived in the U.S. for over 20 years, and his wife and two children are U.S. citizens.",
      "S.F. applied for asylum in the U.S. in the early 2000s, but his application was denied in 2002. His appeal failed but the government did not deport him and he continued to live in the country for decades, according to court documents.",
      "Due to \u201cchanged conditions\u201d in Iran, S.F. would face \u201ca vastly increased danger of persecution\u201d if he were to be deported, Purcell wrote in his petition. \u201cThese circumstances relate to the recent bombing by the United States of Iranian nuclear facilities, thus creating a de facto state of war between the United States and Iran.\u201d",
      "S.F.\u2019s long residency in the U.S., his conversion to Christianity and the fact that his wife and children are U.S. citizens \u201csharply increase the possibility of his imprisonment in Iran, or torture or execution,\u201d he said.",
      "Similarly, Kashanian's daughter said she is worried what will happen to her mother.",
      "\u201cShe tried to do everything right,\u201d Kaitlynn Milne said.",

      "The first pride march was held in New York City in 1970 to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising.",
      "Pride celebrations are typically a daylong mix of jubilant street parties and political protest, but organizers said this year\u2019s iterations will take a more defiant stance than recent years.",
      "The festivities come days after the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark June 26, 2015, ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that recognized same-sex marriage nationwide.",
      "But Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have sought to roll back LGBTQ+ friendly policies.",

      "The theme for the Manhattan event is, appropriately, \u201cRise Up: Pride in Protest.\" San Francisco\u2019s Pride theme is \u201cQueer Joy is Resistance\u201d while Seattle\u2019s is simply \u201cLouder.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not a time to be quiet,\u201d Patti Hearn, Seattle Pride\u2019s executive director, said in a statement ahead of the event. \u201cWe will stand up. We will speak up. We will get loud.\u201d",
      "Among the other headwinds faced by gay rights groups this year is the loss of corporate sponsorship.",
      "American companies have pulled back support of Pride events, reflecting a broader walking back of diversity and inclusion efforts amid shifting public sentiment.",
      "NYC Pride said earlier this month that about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. Organizers of San Francisco Pride said they lost the support of five major corporate donors, including Comcast and Anheuser-Busch.",

He died Friday at his home in northern Virginia after a battle with spindle-cell sarcoma, an aggressive form of cancer, according to his son.",

      "The Florida immigration detention site dubbed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d is being met by opposition from a range of groups concerned with its impacts on local Native American tribes, the Everglades ecosystem and human rights for migrants",
      "A coalition of groups, ranging from environmental activists to Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands, converged outside an airstrip in the Florida Everglades Saturday to protest the imminent construction of an immigrant detention center.",
      "Hundreds of protesters lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades \u2014 also known as Tamiami Trail \u2014 as dump trucks hauling materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to a few Native tribes and several endangered animal species.",
      "Christopher McVoy, an ecologist, said he saw a steady stream of trucks entering the site while he protested for hours. Environmental degradation was a big reason why he came out Saturday. But as a South Florida city commissioner, he said concerns over immigration raids in his city also fueled his opposition.",
      "\u201cPeople I know are in tears, and I wasn't far from it,\u201d he said.",
      "Florida officials have forged ahead over the past week in constructing the compound dubbed as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d within the Everglades' humid swamplands.",
      "The government fast-tracked the project under emergency powers from an executive order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis that addresses what he views as a crisis of illegal immigration. That order lets the state sidestep certain purchasing laws and is why construction has continued despite objections from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and local activists.",
      "The facility will have temporary structures like heavy-duty tents and trailers to house detained immigrants. The state estimates that by early July, it will have 5,000 immigration detention beds in operation.",
      "The compound's proponents have noted its location in the Florida wetlands \u2014 teeming with massive reptiles like alligators and invasive Burmese pythons \u2014 make it an ideal spot for immigration detention.",
      "\u201cClearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there\u2019s a lot of alligators,\u201d DeSantis said Wednesday. \u201cNo one\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida has made an aggressive push for immigration enforcement and has been supportive of the federal government's broader crackdown on illegal immigration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has backed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d which DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said will be partially funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "But Native American leaders in the region have seen the construction as an encroachment onto their sacred homelands, which prompted Saturday's protest. In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as ceremonial and burial grounds and other gathering sites, remain.",
      "Others have raised human rights concerns over what they condemn as the inhumane housing of immigrants. Worries about environmental impacts have also been at the forefront, as groups such as the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades filed a lawsuit Friday to halt the detention center plans.",
      "\u201cThe Everglades is a vast, interconnected system of waterways and wetlands, and what happens in one area can have damaging impacts downstream,\" Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said. \u201cSo it's really important that we have a clear sense of any wetland impacts happening in the site.\u201d",
      "Bryan Griffin, a DeSantis spokesperson, said Friday in response to the litigation that the facility was a \u201cnecessary staging operation for mass deportations located at a preexisting airport that will have no impact on the surrounding environment.\u201d",
      "Until the site undergoes a comprehensive environmental review and public comment is sought, the environmental groups say construction should pause. The facility's speedy establishment is \u201cdamning evidence\u201d that state and federal agencies hope it will be \u201ctoo late\u201d to reverse their actions if they are ordered by a court to do so, said Elise Bennett, a Center for Biological Diversity senior attorney working on the case.",
      "The potential environmental hazards also bleed into other aspects of Everglades life, including a robust tourism industry where hikers walk trails and explore the marshes on airboats, said Floridians for Public Lands founder Jessica Namath, who attended the protest. To place an immigration detention center there makes the area unwelcoming to visitors and feeds into the misconception that the space is in \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEverybody out here sees the exhaust fumes, sees the oil slicks on the road, you know, they hear the sound and the noise pollution. You can imagine what it looks like at nighttime, and we're in an international dark sky area,\u201d Namath said. \u201cIt's very frustrating because, again, there's such disconnect for politicians.\u201d",

      "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to attend the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman on Saturday",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.",
      "Biden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.",
      "The couple\u2019s private funeral, at the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "Neither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman\u2019s adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.",
      "Hortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. It was the first time a couple has been accorded the honor, and the first for a dog. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. The Hortmans' caskets and the dog's urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch as thousands of people filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.",
      "Among the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.",
      "Lisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.",
      "\u201cShe was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,\u201d Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. \u201cShe was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.\"",
      "But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also \u201ca boss.\"",
      "\u201cShe just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,\u201d she said.",
      "The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination.\u201d",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.",
      "An unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\" Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. \"I\u2019ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.\u201d",
      "Atwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter's cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.",
      "Boelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans\u2019 home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers\u2019 homes.",
      "His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.",
      "Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",

    "story": [
      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause",
      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause \u2014 but they do have some leading theories.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency handling the probe, said this week it hopes to conclude the investigation in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe intend for our investigation of this failure to have a lasting impact, save future lives and ensure this never happens again,\u201d NIST investigator Judith Mitrani-Reiser said in the agency's latest report.",
      "Most residents were asleep in the 12-story Champlain Towers South when the beachfront condo building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed into a huge pile of rubble at 1:22 a.m. on June 24, 2021. As the investigation continued, a Miami judge approved a more than $1 billion settlement for personal injury and wrongful death claims from the disaster.",
      "Meanwhile, a new luxury condominium is going up at the Champlain Towers site, a few miles north of Miami.",
      "NIST has zeroed in on what it calls three \u201chigher-likelihood\u201d scenarios, all related to construction flaws that date to the beginning of the 40-year-old structure.",
      "\u201cThese conditions existed from the time construction was complete, 40 years before the partial collapse,\" said Glen Bell, co-lead investigator on NIST\u2019s National Construction Safety Team.",
      "One possibility is the failure of a connection between a building column and the pool deck slab that never met building code standards. Another is that steel reinforcement \u201cwas not placed where it should have been,\u201d which meant the column and pool deck were far too weak.",
      "And a third theory is that work done later around the pool \u2014 when heavy planters, sand and pavers were added \u2014 increased the weight load on a deck \u201cthat was already functionally and structurally inadequate.\u201d",
      "The NIST report also notes that support columns in the building's basement parking garage had been exposed to frequent flooding, which causes corrosion in steel reinforcements and concrete deterioration.",
      "Investigators did not find evidence of voids in the ground under the building, known as \u201ckarst.\u201d Using satellite data, the NIST team found there was no sinking or settling underneath Champlain Towers, which would indicate existence of karst.",
      "In addition, investigators found the limestone upon which the condo was built was \u201csufficient to carry the building loads\" and that testing of the concrete supporting Champlain Towers had \u201cadequate material strength.\u201d",
      "One challenge for investigators was the lack of any available records from the original building construction and not many from its earlier years.",
      "After Surfside, state legislators enacted a law in 2022 requiring condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs. Some residents were caught off guard by hefty fees imposed to cover years of deferred maintenance expenses required to bring their buildings into compliance with the law's standards.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis this week signed new legislation allowing some condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit. It also gives residents more flexibility to pause payments into reserve funds while they prioritize needed repairs. It extends the deadline for condo associations to complete structural integrity studies and exempts some smaller buildings from those studies.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to make the change,\u201d state Sen. Ed Hooper said. \u201cElderly people are losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase in their monthly HOA fees. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "It's a luxury condo building, dubbed the Delmore, with 37 \u201cmansions in the sky\u201d and a starting price of $15 million. The site was purchased at auction by Dubai-based DAMAC International for $120 million.",
      "According to the company, there will be amenities such as a see-through swimming pool, an indoor pool, an outdoor kitchen, a fitness center and a meditation garden.",
      "The new condo is expected to be completed by 2029.",
      "A design for a memorial to the 98 victims and that honors their families was approved earlier this year by Surfside officials and a family committee. But the city's planning and zoning board objected to its appearance and recommended that alternatives be considered.",
      "The existing proposal envisions a tall \u201cwall of water\u201d and exhibition of materials from the collapsed building. Surfside officials say they want to keep the project on track but will consider additional input, especially from the family committee.",
      "\u201cI understand the urgency. But this memorial is going to be here long beyond anyone in this room,\" said planning board chair Lindsay Lecour at an April city commission meeting.",

      "Fireworks are as American as apple pie",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Like clockwork, Carla Johnson sends out letters every spring asking for donations to help pay for the annual Fourth of July fireworks show that draws tens of thousands of people to New Mexico's largest lake.",
      "And she has no reservations about doling out verbal reminders when she sees her patrons around town. There's too much at stake to be shy about fundraising when donations collected by Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park are what make the tradition possible.",
      "But even Johnson\u2019s ardent efforts as the group's fundraiser might not cut it next year if the U.S. and China remain locked in a trade war.",
      "With nearly all of the aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that fuel America's Fourth of July celebrations being imported from China, volunteer groups like Johnson's and cities big and small have been closely watching the negotiations.",
      "A 90-day pause on what had been massive tariffs brought some temporary relief, but industry experts acknowledge that the tiff has lit a fuse of uncertainty as the price tag for future fireworks displays could skyrocket if an agreement isn\u2019t reached.",
      "There were similar concerns in 2019 as trade talks between the U.S. and China dragged on. Industry groups had called on officials then to exempt fireworks from escalating tariffs.",
      "The American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association reignited the lobbying effort this spring, noting in letters to President Donald Trump that fireworks play a crucial role in American celebrations. The groups say the industry is made up mostly of family-owned companies that are often locked into long-term contracts that leave them unable to raise prices to offset cost surges brought on by higher tariffs.",
      "And there are few options for sourcing the more than 300 million pounds (136 million kilograms) of fireworks needed to feed demands. China produces 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional display fireworks used in the U.S., according to the APA.",
      "\u201cI think overall it\u2019s the uncertainty,\u201d said Julie Heckman, the APA's executive director. \u201cYeah, we have a 90-day pause, but are the negotiations with China going to go well? Or is it going to go sky-high again? You know, triple digits. It\u2019s very hard for a small business to plan.\"",
      "Fireworks have their roots in China. To ward off evil spirits, people would throw bamboo stalks into a fire, causing them to pop as the air inside the hollow pockets heated up. These early firecrackers evolved into more sophisticated fireworks after the Chinese developed gunpowder in the 9th century.",
      "By the 15th century, Europe was using fireworks for religious festivals and entertainment. In 1777, they were used in Philadelphia and Boston for what were the first organized Independence Day celebrations.",
      "Now, fireworks are synonymous with the summer holiday and with ringing in the new year. Shows have become elaborately choreographed displays that are often synced to live music. In Nashville, the Music City's award-winning symphony orchestra puts its own spin on the festivities.",
      "In New York City, organizers of the Macy's show will fire off 80,000 shells, with some reaching heights of 1,000 feet (304 meters). The National Park Service promises a spectacular show on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.",
      "At Elephant Butte in southern New Mexico, they're going old school and will light the fireworks by hand. Charlie Warren, vice president of the Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park, said it's like spectators are getting two shows at once as the colors reflect on the water below and the loud booms reverberate off the lake.",
      "Johnson, who also serves as the group's treasurer, gets emotional describing the experience.",
      "\u201cOh man, in my heart and sometimes out loud, I\u2019m singing the Star-Spangled Banner. I\u2019ll sing it out loud to the top of my lungs when I watch that show,\" she said. \u201cIt makes you proud to be in this country, and we\u2019re celebrating our freedom, and I\u2019m going to start crying now. Don\u2019t get me started.\u201d",
      "Organizers in Nashville ordered fireworks for that show over a year ago so they weren't affected by the tariffs. It was the same in one of New Mexico's largest cities, where Rio Rancho officials planned to spend a little more to go bigger and higher this year.",
      "In Oklahoma, Big Blast Fireworks supplies nonprofit groups so they can fundraise by setting up fireworks stands. The company received its first container from China in January before the tariffs hit. The second container arrived in February and was subject to a 10% tariff. The third container was put on hold to avoid the highest tariffs, meaning inventory could be tight later this year if nothing changes.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we are passionate about watching our price points and intentional about passing along as much savings on to customers as possible,\" said Melissa Torkleson, a managing partner at Big Blast.",
      "With some orders on hold, industry experts say Chinese manufacturers throttled back production as warehouses filled up. The backup in the supply chain also has resulted in competition for shipping space aboard ocean vessels, and Heckman, the APA's director, said it will take much more than flipping a light switch to ease either situation.",
      "If the trade war drags on, she said, there are ways that show organizers can adjust and spectators might not notice. A minute or two could be shaved from a show or certain types of fireworks could be substituted with less expensive options.",
      "As for this year, Warren said the price tag for the Elephant Butte show was unchanged and he and Johnson can't wait to see spectators lining the shoreline, on the surrounding hillsides and on boats bobbing on the lake. The mission every year is to make sure \u201cthat the T's are all crossed,\" Warren said.",
      "\"Because this community would not be happy if this show didn\u2019t come off,\u201d he said.",

      "Child safety advocates are warning about the dangers of heatstroke from leaving kids in hot cars",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A record heat wave that spread across the East Coast of the United States during the first week of summer has child advocates warning parents and caretakers about the risks of heatstroke to children left inside hot vehicles.",
      "So far this year, nine children have died after being left unattended in vehicles in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey and North Carolina, according to Kids and Car Safety, which collects data on hot car deaths. Five died in June.",
      "And last year, 39 children in the U.S. died after being left in hot cars.",
      "Human-caused climate change keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists say. But the temperature outside doesn't have to be super hot for a child left in a vehicle to be affected by the heat, said Kathy Wall, director of Safe Kids Palm Beach County.",
      "\u201cInside, the vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 20 minutes,\u201d Wall said. \u201cSo if you imagine it\u2019s an 80 degree day, which in South Florida is a cool day, it could be over 100 degrees within 10 minutes inside the car.\"",
      "Hot car deaths can happen any time of year, and since 1998, every state but Alaska has reported a hot car death, according to the National Safety Council. In both 2018 and 2019, a record 53 children died after being left in hot cars.",
      "About 80% of the heat rise in vehicles happens in the first 30 minutes of a child being left inside, when maximum temperatures can exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), according to data compiled by Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San Jose State University.",
      "\u201cChildren sweat a lot less than adults do and their internal temperature can increase three to five times faster than an adult. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s just as important to make sure that your child isn\u2019t left in the vehicle, especially during these rising temperatures,\" said Capt. Karen Derogatis of Palm Beach County Fire Rescue.",
      "While it\u2019s easy to place blame for leaving a child in a vehicle, even people trained to know the dangers have made that tragic mistake, Wall said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a socioeconomic group, it\u2019s not a cultural group,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sadly has happened to doctors, it\u2019s happened to dentists, it happened to school teachers, it\u2019s happened to child care workers. Nobody is exempt from this.\u201d",
      "Distraction often leads to forgetting about a child in the backseat, which is why it is important to create routines and reminders, she said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds crazy, but sometimes people get out of routines or are distracted, especially in today\u2019s world. There\u2019s lots going on in the news, lots going with families,\u201d she said.",
      "A parent who normally doesn't drop a child off at a day care facility might become distracted and forget that the child is in the vehicle, she said.",
      "She encourages parents and caregivers to establish routines.",
      "\u201cWe have an acronym, ACT,\" Wall said.",
      "A stands for avoiding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle.",
      "C stands for creating a reminder that works best for you. Authorities suggest leaving a personal item such as a purse or briefcase in the backseat so you'll have to open the back door before locking the vehicle.",
      "T is to take action right away. \u201cIf you see a child in a car, don\u2019t try to figure out how long they\u2019ve been in the car. Call 911 immediately,\" Wall said.",
      "Some newer cars offer warnings for drivers to check the backseat for passengers.",
      "Double checking the vehicle is key, said Derogatis, the fire captain.",

      "She wore the shirt during a Juneteenth performance on her Cowboy Carter tour.",
      "A T-shirt worn by Beyonc\u00e9 during a Juneteenth performance on her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour has sparked a discussion over how Americans frame their history and caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born superstar.",
      "The T-shirt worn during a concert in Paris featured images of the Buffalo Soldiers, who belonged to Black U.S. Army units active during the late 1800s and early 1900s. On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included \u201ctheir antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.\u201d",
      "Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s website.",
      "As she prepares to return to the U.S. for performances in her hometown this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 for wearing a shirt that frames Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism and for promoting anti-Indigenous language.",
      "A spokesperson for Beyonc\u00e9 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the Civil War in 1866. They were comprised of formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black Civil War soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts \u2014 including in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II \u2014 until they were disbanded in 1951.",
      "As the quote on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the U.S. Army's campaign of violence and land theft during the country's westward expansion.",
      "Some historians say the moniker \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters, but that might be more legend than fact. \u201cAt the end of the day, we really don\u2019t have that kind of information,\u201d said Cale Carter, director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.",
      "Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities.",
      "\u201cWe romanticize the Western frontier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early stories that talked about the Buffalo Soldiers were impacted by a lot of those factors. So you really didn\u2019t see a changing in that narrative until recently.\u201d",
      "There has often been a lack of diverse voices discussing how the history of the Buffalo Soldiers is framed, said Michelle Tovar, the museum's director of education. The current political climate has put enormous pressure on schools, including those in Texas, to avoid honest discussions about American history, she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, in this area, we are getting pushback from a lot of school districts in which we can\u2019t go and teach this history,\" Tovar said. \"We are a museum where we can at least be a hub, where we can invite the community regardless of what districts say, invite them to learn it and do what we can do the outreach to continue to teach honest history.\u201d",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's recent album \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter\u201d has played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre's adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard's country music chart, and \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d won her the top prize at the 2025 Grammy Awards, album of the year.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers play this major role in the Black ownership of the American West,\u201d said Tad Stoermer, a historian and professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIn my view, (Beyonc\u00e9 is) well aware of the role that these images play. This is the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 tour for crying out loud. The entire tour, the entire album, the entire piece is situated in this layered narrative.\u201d",
      "But Stoermer also points out that the Buffalo Soldiers have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.",
      "As Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E. Roberts, a historian, author and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the Civil War to present day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the category in which she thought maybe she was coming into this conversation, but the Buffalo Soldiers are even a step above that because they were literally involved in not just the settlement of the West but of genocide in a sense,\u201d she said.",
      "Several Native influencers, performers, and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 or decry the shirt's language as anti-Indigenous. \u201cDo you think Beyonc\u00e9 will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt?\u201d indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000 followers, asked in a post Thursday.",
      "Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers are an interesting historical moment to look at. But we have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,\u201d said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.",
      "Okorafor said there is no \u201cprogressive\u201d way to reclaim America's history of empire building in the West, and that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Western symbolism sends a problematic message: \u201cThat Black people, too, can engage in American nationalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlack people, too, can profit from the atrocities of (the) American empire,\u201d she said. \"It is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside of the United States. It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country, but the longer your line extends in this country, the more virtuous you are.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign has piqued the interest of South Asians and Muslims in New York City and beyond",
      "The success of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor is euphoric for Hari Kondabolu, a stand-up comedian who's been friends with the candidate for 15 years.",
      "Mamdani stunned the political establishment when he declared victory in the primary on Tuesday, a ranked choice election in which his strongest competition, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, conceded defeat.",
      "When he launched his campaign, the unabashed democratic socialist ranked near the bottom of the pack. Now, the 33-year-old state assemblyman has a chance to be New York City's first Asian American and Muslim mayor. Mamdani's family came to the United States when he was 7, and he became a citizen in 2018. He was born to Indian parents in Kampala, Uganda.",
      "For Kondabolu, this moment is not just exciting, but emotional.",
      "\u201cI think so many of us have had those experiences in New York of being brown and in a city that has always been really diverse and feels like ours. But after 9/11, like you start to question it like, is this our city too,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cAnd 25 years later ... it\u2019s surreal, like this is the same city but it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve elected this person.\u201d",
      "Mamdani's campaign has piqued the interest of many Indian, Pakistani and other South Asian Americans, as well as Muslims \u2014 even those who may not agree with Mamdani on every issue. Despite that opposition, some still see his rise as a sign of hope in a city where racism and xenophobia erupted following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Many of New York City's over 300,000 South Asian residents have been inspired by Mamdani\u2019s extraordinary trajectory.",
      "\u201cMy mom was texting her friends to vote for him. I\u2019ve never seen my mother do that before,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cSo the idea that it\u2019s gotten our whole family activated in this way \u2014 this is, like, personal.\u201d",
      "Snigdha Sur, founder and CEO of The Juggernaut, an online publication reporting on South Asians, has been fascinated by the response from some people in India and the diaspora.",
      "\u201cSo many global South Asians ... they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this guy is my mayor and I don\u2019t live in New York City,\u2019\u201d Sur said.",
      "At the same time, some are also concerned or angered by Mamdani's past remarks about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he publicly called a \u201cwar criminal.\u201d",
      "In Michigan, Thasin Sardar has been following Mamdani\u2019s ascent online. When he first heard him, he struck him as \u201cgenuine\u201d and he felt \u201can instant connection,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs a Muslim American, this victory puts my trust back in the people,\u201d said Sardar, who was born and raised in India. \u201cI am happy that there are people who value the candidate and his policies more than his personal religious beliefs and didn\u2019t vote him down because of the color of his skin, or the fact that he was an immigrant with an uncommon name.\u201d",
      "New York voter Zainab Shabbir said family members in California, and beyond, have also excitedly taken note.",
      "\u201cMy family in California, they were very much like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s so nice to see a South Asian Muslim candidate be a mayor of a major city,\u2019\u201d she said. A brother told her Mamdani\u2019s rise is a great example for his kids, she said.",
      "But the 34-year-old \u2014 who donated, voted and canvassed for Mamdani \u2014 said it was his vision for New York City that was the draw for her. She and her husband briefly chatted with Mamdani at a fundraiser and she found him to be \u201cvery friendly and genuine.\u201d",
      "She suspects that for some who aren\u2019t very politically active, Mamdani\u2019s political ascent could make a difference.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Muslim communities like my parents\u2019 generation who are focused a lot more on the politics back home and less on the politics here in America,\u201d said Shabbir. \u201cSeeing people like Zohran Mamdani be in office, it\u2019ll really change that perspective in a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Supporters and pundits agree that Mamdani's campaign has demonstrated social media savvy and authenticity. He visited multiple mosques. In videos, he speaks in Hindi or gives a touch of Bollywood. Other South Asian American politicians such as Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna praised that.",
      "\u201cI love that he didn\u2019t run away from his heritage. I mean, he did video clips with Amitabh Bachchan and Hindi movies,\u201d Khanna said, referencing the Indian actor. \u201cHe shows that one can embrace their roots and their heritage and yet succeed in American politics.\u201d",
      "But his triumph also reflects \u201cthe urgency of the economic message, the challenge that people are facing in terms of rent, in terms of the cost of living, and how speaking to that is so powerful,\u201d the progressive California Democrat added.",
      "Tanzeela Rahman, a daughter of Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh, said she grew up \u201cvery low income\u201d in New York.",
      "\u201cI felt seen by him in a way politicians have not seen me ever,\u201d the 29-year-old financial systems analyst said. \u201cI think very few people in government understand \u2026 how hard it is to survive in New York City.\u201d",
      "She found Mamdani to be \u201cunabashedly Muslim\u201d and also \u201ca voice, who, literally, to me sounds like a New Yorker who\u2019s stepping in and saying, hey, let\u2019s reclaim our power,\u201d she said.",
      "While Mamdani has been speaking to the working class, he had a somewhat privileged upbringing. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.",
      "He lived in Queens but attended The Bronx High School of Science. Even as a teen, he cared about social justice, Kondabolu, the comedian, recalled.",
      "His campaign messaging on issues such as affordable housing and free bus rides might not resonate with South Asian households in New York City who have income levels above the median. But, the irony is that his campaign and \u201cgreat kind of soundbites\u201d earned support from that demographic, too, according to Sur.",
      "\u201cIt was, I think, a surprise that he did so well among the wealthiest, including his own community,\u201d Sur said.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s outspoken support for Palestinian causes and criticism of Israel and its military campaign in Gaza resonated with pro-Palestinian residents, including Muslims, but caused tension in the mayor\u2019s race. Some of his positions and remarks on the charged issue have drawn recriminations from opponents and some Jewish groups, though he\u2019s also been endorsed by some Jewish politicians and activists.",
      "Mamdani's success immediately elicited strong anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric from some high-profile conservatives on social media, including conservative media personality Charlie Kirk who posted that \u201clegal immigration can ruin your country.\u201d In response, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, tweeted \u201cFor years they sold people the lie of \u2018we have no problem if you come the right way!\u2019\u201d",
      "His supporters aren't concerned that racism and Islamophobia will distract from Mamdani's campaign. Those feelings clearly weren't \u201cenough for him to lose\u201d the primary, Kondabolu said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a new generation that wants their voice heard and that generation came out in full force, not just by voting, but by, like, getting all these other people to be emotionally invested in this candidate,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cThat\u2019s extraordinary.\u201d",

    "summary": "The BBC says it regrets not cutting off the Glastonbury festival live stream of punk-rap duo Bob Vylan's performance, which included an anti-Israel chant.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014 The BBC has said it regrets not pulling down its live stream of a performance at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend that included what the broadcaster calls \"utterly unacceptable\" chants against Israel's military.",
      "The taxpayer-funded BBC said in a statement Monday that it regrets not cutting short its live streaming signal after punk-rap duo Bob Vylan started leading a chant of \"Death, death to the IDF,\" during their Saturday performance, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\"The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence,\" the statement\u00a0from the broadcaster said. \"The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves... The [BBC broadcasting] team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.\"",
      "The BBC, which is CBS News' partner network in the U.K., quickly acknowledged that the language used on Saturday was \"deeply offensive,\" but the network was criticized \u2014 including by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and members of his cabinet \u2014\u2014 for not reacting more quickly after the chant started.",
      "Glastonbury festival's organizers also condemned the chant in a statement, saying: \"Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.\"",
      "The reaction from the Trump administration appeared to be significantly harsher, with Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau saying in a social media post on Monday that U.S. entry visas already issued to Bob Vylan's members had been revoked \"in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants.\"",
      "The band's website shows more than a dozen scheduled tour dates in the U.S., from coast to coast, starting in late October.",
      "\"Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,\" Landau said in the post.",
      "On Sunday, Bob Vylan posted a lengthy statement on their Instagram\u00a0page, with the caption: \"I said what I said.\"",
      "The duo, who use stage names and keep their identities anonymous, said their message was aimed at younger generations, whom they said should be shown how to fight for their own futures.",
      "\"Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,\" the band said. \"Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organizing online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.\"",
      "Local police have launched an investigation into the chants to determine whether any criminal offenses may have been committed.",
      "Glastonbury is a five-day music festival that takes place on a farm in the southwest of England. It is one of the largest music festivals anywhere in the world, drawing more than 200,000 ticketholders, and it generally takes place every other year as the organizers give the farm fields time to recover from the impact of so many revelers. The event is hosted and organized by the Eavis family, who still own the farm, and has been running for about 55 years.",
      "Bob Vylan's performance preceded that of Northern Irish rappers Kneecap, whose set the BBC did not air live due to previous instances at the group's concerts involving alleged comments supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and calling for the death of Conservative party lawmakers.",
      "Kneecap's members have insisted that they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah.\"",
      "They sent \"heartfelt apologies\" to the families of two British lawmakers who were murdered in recent years after their remarks about Conservative parliamentarians.",

      "Jurors started deliberating Monday in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' sex trafficking case, weighing charges that could put the hip-hop mogul in prison for life.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian began reading instructions on the law on Monday morning to the jury of eight men and four women. Now, they'll sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"The prosecution made clear there only has to be one instance, out of these hundreds of 'freak-offs,' one instance where it was coerced by force, fraud or coercion, and that can include threats of harm that doesn't even include physical harm,\" Polisi said. \"So that can include fear of financial harm, fear of reputational harm. Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",
      "She said that he used his \"close inner circle and a small army of personal staff, who made it their mission to meet the defendant's every desire, promote his power and protect his reputation at all costs.\"",
      "Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo countered, \"This isn't about crime. It's about money.\" He noted that one of Combs' accusers in the criminal case also sued him in civil court.",
      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

    "summary": "The fighter for Truth, Justice and the American Way is back on the big screen. Director James Gunn talks about his re-imagining of the Man of Steel, and actor David Corenswet discusses the challenges of taking on the iconic role.",
    "story": [
      "He was born on the planet Krypton. But the Man of Steel comes to life in California, inside an edit room in Burbank. It's there that James Gunn is reviewing a scene from what Warner Brothers hopes is a summer blockbuster: \"Superman.\" With a reported budget of at least $225 million, it arrives in theaters July 11.",
      "It's the first feature from DC Studios, a division of Warner Brothers.\u00a0 Gunn is not only the film's director; he wrote the screenplay, and he's DC's CEO.",
      "\"I feel good about the movie,\" he said. \"And I'm excited about that. And I think we've done something that's different.\"",
      "Among those differences: \"My Superman is not indestructible,\" Gunn said. \"We see him bleed, immediately. At times, I've thought, 'He's too strong.' You don't want him to be able to punch a planet in half or, for that matter, go around a planet a billion times and make time go backwards, you know? I wanted a Superman who was a little bit more down-to-Earth.\"",
      "And few things are more down-to-Earth than a dog. \"The dog is the whole reason \u2013 [it] was the start of the movie for me, a thousand percent,\" Gunn said. \"I adopted a dog. His name is Ozu. And he didn't want to be touched, he had never known human beings. He chewed up all our furniture. He was, you know, chasing the cat, and just being the worst dog you can imagine. And I thought, 'Wow. What if this terrible dog had super powers? I'd really be screwed!'\"",
      "The first Superman feature film came in 1951 with George Reeves, who later played the role on TV. In this century, Superman has been played by Brandon Routh and Henry Cavill. But in the last 75 years, only one big screen Superman has fully captured the audience's imagination: Christopher Reeve.",
      "Trained in the theater, Reeve was a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York \u2013 as is the new Superman, David Corenswet. He is 31 \u2013 seven years older than Reeve was when he made his debut in 1978. \"I don't think there's any way or reason to try to sort of live up to Christopher Reeve,\" Corenswet said. \"I just feel grateful to get to play that character that he embodied and put into the public consciousness in such a positive and strong way.\"",
      "We met Corenswet at the Arden Theatre in Philadelphia. It's Corenswet's hometown, where he still lives, and it's at the Arden where he landed his first paid gig, when he was nine years old: \"All My Sons\" by Arthur Miller.",
      "Like his Superman, Corenswet is immediately disarming, as well as vulnerable, as in a scene with Superman's girlfriend, reporter Lois Lane (played by Rachel Brosnahan).",
      "\"He is definitively different from everybody else on Earth,\" Corenswet said. \"He is not human. He's an alien, and he has these powers that nobody else has. And at the same time, he wants desperately to be a part of humanity. So ultimately, the dramatic stakes of Superman as a character is that he is lonely and he doesn't want to be.\"",
      "He also has a sense of humor about those red shorts. \"Without the trunks, the uniform can look very military,\" Corenswet said. \"So he puts the red underwear on, a) so that everybody can see him, against the blue sky you can see the red trunks, b) so that everybody knows he doesn't take himself too seriously. He's not trying to look cool.",
      "\"Now, that doesn't in any way undermine how badass and cool he is when he's up in the sky fighting the bad guys. But once he touches down, he wants to be the one that people can laugh or make fun of, because he can take it.\"",
      "Superman has been saving the world for nearly nine decades. Created by Jerry Siegel and drawn by Joe Shuster, he first appeared in a comic in 1938.",
      "Asked if Superman represents the signature American movie character, critic and filmmaker Elvis Mitchell said, \"I think he's bigger than that. Spider-Man is tortured. You know, he has to support himself and his aunt, and he's responsible for the death of his uncle. And Batman's responsible for the death of everybody in his line of sight. They're all sufferers.",
      "\"But Superman, he stands tall, and there's a pride of authorship, literally, in the character. 'Cause he's creating his own narrative as his alter ego. People want to see that. They want to believe that you can create your own narrative in a way that is benevolent, even if you have all the power in the world. It's wrong of you to turn away from people who need your help.\"",
      "Asked what he wants audiences around the world to take away from his Superman, Gunn said, \"I think, just culturally, being able to place a little bit more importance on being a good human being. I think we're surrounded by a lot of meanness. I think Superman is surrounded by a lot of meanness in the movie. But he stands against that grain. And that's what makes him rebellious.",
      "\"And in a way, I think today, in today's world, Superman's the edgier, more rebellious character because he's the one who's standing up for the values that most people are not,\" he said.",
      "Corenswet is embracing the challenge, fully aware that success could mean Superman defines his career. He said, \"When you take a role that's gonna be this visible and this iconic, even just visually iconic, and it's your face and the underwear, yeah, I wanted to be prepared for the possibility that it wouldn't lead to a bunch of other things, that this would be the thing.",
      "\"And I felt really lucky that when I asked myself that question the answer came back, somebody's gotta play this part, and if you're the person to play it and you give up everything else to do it, it would be worth doing.\"",

      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",
      "In her rebuttal, Comey said, \"Being a domestic abuser is not a defense to sex trafficking.\"",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",

      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \"Mission: Impossible\" and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",

      "MARINA has scored billions of streams without ever having a top 10 single in the U.K. or U.S., yet her influence runs deep among a generation of artists including Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. \"I think artists who are very commercially successful, like they'll have these peaks and troughs and mine's kind of like been like steadily going up,\" MARINA said.",

      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",

    "summary": "Bobby Sherman was a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

      "The prosecution and defense rested their cases Tuesday in the sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs.",
      "The prosecution rested after calling more than 30 witnesses, including former employees and male escorts. Two former girlfriends, including\u00a0Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura\u00a0and a woman using the pseudonym \"Jane\" took the stand and told the jury they did not want to participate in so-called \"freak offs,\" described as drug fueled sexual encounters with male escorts they said Combs would direct.",
      "Jurors saw pictures of guns, drugs, baby oil and other lubricant, and they saw a video of a 2016 Los Angeles hotel incident\u00a0during which Combs was seen attacking Ventura.",
      "On cross-examination, the defense showed texts and other messages, arguing it showed the women were willing participants.",
      "As soon as the prosecution rested, Combs' defense team moved for acquittal, claiming the government failed to meet its burden in proving the charges. The judge said he'd reserve judgment on the motion.",
      "\"You're doing an excellent job,\" Combs tells judge",
      "Combs' defense team did not call any witnesses.",
      "The judge asked Combs how he was doing, and Combs replied he was doing great.",
      "\"You're doing an excellent job,\" Combs told the judge.",
      "The judge then asked Combs about his decision not to testify.",
      "\"That is my decision, your honor,\" Combs said Tuesday. \"That is solely my decision.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys entered exhibits, including law enforcement notes of interviews, then rested.",
      "\"I don't see what the upside would have been for the defense to put him on the stand to try and quibble about the technicalities of the claims against him, and then he would be cross-examined for days about every bad thing he did,\" said attorney Richard Schoenstein, who is not involved in the case.",
      "About the charges",
      "Combs, 55, has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts and faces up to life in prison if he's convicted.",
      "The first count is racketeering conspiracy, which alleges combs \"abused, threatened and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.\" Prosecutors allege Combs relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in, or attempted to engage in, \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "The other four counts are sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "\"I think they've proved that prostitutes were moved from one state to another and that Diddy was involved,\" Schoenstein said.",
      "Schoenstein said the other counts are more debatable.",
      "\"Sex trafficking by force, and that's going to be more of an assessment of what the relationships between Diddy and Cassie and what Diddy and Jane were like and what the jury thinks of all that,\" Schoenstein said.",
      "Closing arguments are set for Thursday at 9 a.m. Attorneys indicated that closing arguments may take all day Thursday and Friday, meaning that deliberations may not begin until Monday.",
      "The trial is in its seventh week.\u00a0A juror was dismissed as the prosecution neared the end of its case over questions about where that juror actually lived. And rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, stopped by the trial to observe the proceedings briefly at one point.",

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Scientists conducting medical research are facing an existential crisis: Layoffs and budget cuts pushed by President Trump that, they say, jeopardize finding a cure for cancer.",
    "story": [
      "They might easily be mistaken for Congressional staffers, reluctant to face the day, but these are among the most accomplished cancer specialists in the country, meeting with Representatives, Senators and staff. Among them: Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, from up the road in Baltimore; and Dr. George Weiner, a cancer specialist in Iowa for more than 35 years, who has flown in frequently to lobby Congress for more research funds.",
      "Lobbying for cancer research, he says, used to be like pushing on an open door. \"Most of the time when I've come, I've met with Democrats and Republicans, and we talked about the bipartisan support for cancer research,\" Weiner said. \"This is the first time that I felt there was an existential crisis in our ability to make the type of progress that I see in front of us.\"",
      "These days, the conversation is all about thousands of layoffs \u2026 delays in research \u2026 massive budget cuts \u2013 close to a 40% proposed cut in funding for the National Cancer Institute.",
      "\"I wake up every morning looking at my phone: Did I get an email from the National Cancer Institute saying I'm no longer receiving my grants?\" said Jaffee.",
      "Has she felt the impact yet? \"Oh, yeah, we certainly have felt the impact, to the point where people are leaving,\" Jaffee replied. \"So, in our clinical research operation, which takes years to build, train research nurses, takes two years to train coordinators, takes six to 12 months, these people are leaving because the funding isn't coming in.\"",
      "I asked, \"If they keep cutting back, how long before Dr. Jaffee says, 'That's it'?\"",
      "\"I have to be honest, there are days when I do feel that,\" she replied. \"But I look around and I feel like I would be disloyal to our patients. We are in a technological revolution in cancer research. We are rapidly making discoveries that we couldn't even do ten years ago.\"",
      "\"What price do you put on life?\"",
      "Kevin Callahan was a Marine in Vietnam when he barely survived stepping on a land mine. Decades later, he was diagnosed with a killer disease: pancreatic cancer. First came surgery and chemo. Now, he's part of a clinical trial, which is where Dr. Jaffee and her colleague Dr. Neeha Zaidi come in, working to develop a vaccine to prevent pancreatic cancer from recurring.",
      "I asked Callahan, \"When you see some of the debates that are going on right now, and it relates to the National Cancer Institute and NIH \u2026\"",
      "\"It raises the hair on the back of my neck,\" he replied.",
      "Beth Callahan wasn't all that sure about the clinical trial at first, but Kevin couldn't stop thinking about all that had gone into it \u2013 getting chemotherapy as an approved treatment. \"They would shoot me up with three drugs, and the fourth one I would go home with a little bag on my chest, and it wouldn't come out until Friday. It had to be done over 40 hours. I thought to myself, 'How many poor bastards went through tests to get that done?' So I thought, 'If there's anything that I can do, I'm more than happy to go in with the study and see if I can help somebody else later on, [to] develop this vaccine.'\"",
      "Pancreatic cancer is particularly nasty, even when, as with Kevin, it's detected early. The experimental vaccine they've been administering to him is promising, but according to Jaffee, the chances of recurrence are 80%, and the chances of a patient being alive in five years is 20%.",
      "Yet, Kevin is four-and-a-half years out, without recurrence, \"part of a small cohort of patients who received the vaccine on that trial who are, like him, doing well without recurrence,\" Jaffee said.",
      "I asked, \"Could it be anything other than the vaccine?",
      "Jaffee replied, \"We don't believe so. This is not a cancer where sometimes it looks less aggressive than other times. This is a cancer that uniformly \u2013 it doesn't matter who you are \u2013 it comes back.\"",
      "And so far, it has not. Kevin says, \"Bottom line, I'm cancer free.\"",
      "Now the Callahans are concerned the cuts at the NIH could interfere with \u2013 or even stop \u2013 Kevin's vaccine trial.",
      "I said, \"They claim that they're not cutting back on any of the science, on any of the people who are really doing the research.\"",
      "\"I don't believe that for a minute,\" said Kevin.",
      "Asked if it is worth the money invested by taxpayers, Beth responded: \"What price do you put on life? It's our lives. It's our children's lives. It's our grandchildren's lives. What price do you put on that? We're not just talking about cutting funding to individual research programs. We're talking about NIH, which is a gift that we have had in this country for decades. Why would we give that up as a country?\"",
      "Located just outside of Washington, D.C., the National Cancer Institute is the crown jewel of the National Institutes of Health. It is also the most expensive. Its budget last year was $7 billion.",
      "Dr. Weiner noted, \"Mary Lasker, who was a brilliant woman and a force of nature who worked with Richard Nixon on the original war on cancer, would say, 'If you think research is expensive, try disease.'\"",
      "The Trump administration is proposing cutting that $7 billion cancer budget down to about $4.5 billion. Weiner thinks that America's widely-recognized position as the world's leader in medical research is at a tipping point. \"Progress is gonna be proportional to investment,\" he said. \"So, progress is not gonna totally stop if funding drops dramatically. But the more it drops and the longer it drops, the slower progress will be.",
      "\"But that's not the case for patients,\" he said. \"Our job as researchers is to bring those advances to help those patients as soon as possible, because those patients can't wait.\"",
      "That would describe Natalie Phelps' dilemma to a T.",
      "\"When is cancer political?",
      "Natalie Phelps has Stage 4 metastatic colorectal cancer. \u00a0She and her husband, Jeff, live out in Washington State.",
      "\"We have one boy, one girl, and a giant German Shepherd, very average American,\" she said. \"And I had always hoped, if I needed a clinical trial, I was like, 'I'm gonna get to the NIH. I'm gonna go to the top place in the world.'\"",
      "Phelps was invited to NIH for testing to determine if she qualified for a promising breakthrough immunotherapy treatment that has shrunk tumors in about a quarter of the patients with gastrointestinal cancers. \u00a0She said, \"When I was invited to go back, I had cancer patients congratulating me. They were like, 'You made it!' It's like making it into the Olympics when you're a cancer patient.\"",
      "The clinical trial is run by Dr. Steven Rosenberg, a legend in the field of cancer research who is still practicing in his mid-eighties. \"Well, she's a young woman with a metastatic cancer, and so that's a desperate situation. Every patient we see here at the National Cancer Institute has been through all standard treatments that haven't worked. And they come here to the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, of Hope, trying to see if some experimental treatments might be of help to them.\"",
      "In late May, Natalie Phelps finally qualified for Rosenberg's clinical trial. But budget cuts at NIH had already slowed the trial down. NIH has lost about 1,500 employees.",
      "\"We did lose two technicians that are involved in producing the materials that are used to treat patients,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "\"And would that cause a significant delay?\" I asked. \"When I say 'significant,' I mean in Natalie's case she feels that it has been delayed by a month. Is that correct?\"",
      "\"That's correct.\"",
      "\"A month could be critical for her.\"",
      "\"It certainly can when you have metastatic cancer that's growing,\" Rosenberg said.",
      "That one-month delay means Natalie's specialized immune cell therapy won't be ready until late July. I said to her, \"I don't even know what seems like an appropriate question. You must be devastated.\"",
      "\"Well, yeah, Ted,\" she replied. \"I was diagnosed in 2020 during COVID, after giving birth to my second child. And I had to spend the first bit of my child's life changing diapers and doing bottles with the chemotherapy pump attached to me. I've done 48 rounds of chemotherapy. I've had multiple aggressive surgeries and radiation. And I have been in treatment for five years, hoping that I can raise her, but at the very least let her have a memory of who her mother was.",
      "\"I have endured so much, and now I have another hurdle just because of funding cuts?\" she said. \"I mean, my husband and I can't believe it. When is cancer political?\"",
      "In a recent online statement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya pushed back on concerns about budget cuts and employee layoffs. He said, \"As to the current re-organization, no clinical trial has been delayed, nor has any participant been dropped from any clinical trial\u2026\"",
      "Natalie Phelps is just one patient, one case out of many; but her participation in a clinical trial was delayed, because two specialized technicians were let go.",
      "And that delay has proved to be devastating. She sent us a video message a couple of days ago from NIH:",
      "\"I got my test results back today and I didn't pass,\" she said. \"I have several new brain tumors, and it's not safe for me to participate in the trial. The earliest I could get back here for treatment would be about six weeks after having the tumors radiated, provided that the radiation's successful. I don't know. It's a long time.\"",
      "As for the budget cuts that caused the layoffs that produced the delay, it probably won't help much to learn that they were nothing personal.",

    "title": "Experts say halting U.S. funds for Gavi vaccine alliance will cost lives",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-us-funding-gavi-vaccine-alliance-travesty-experts-warn/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring Lyn Redwood, a nurse and the former head of a group critics have denounced as anti-vaccine, to work in its vaccine safety office, multiple CDC officials tell CBS News.",
      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",
      "\"I was so naive. I really thought that they would take immediate action, and that they would stop these exposures,\" she said.",

      "New Yorkers have a new logo in town as Luckin Coffee, a popular Chinese coffee chain, announces its debut in the United States.",
      "The Starbucks rival opened its first two stores in New York City on Monday, as the Xiamen-based coffee purveyor sets out to expand its market and garner favor with U.S. customers. The two Manhattan storefronts are located at 755 Broadway in Greenwich Village and 800 6th Ave in Chelsea.",
      "The Chinese company first announced its U.S. arrival last week,\u00a0posting on Instagram, \"Drip level: International. The rumors are true, NYC. You're luckin now.\" Since then, the chain has been teasing \"soft openings\" on its social media accounts, offering promotional deals to get customers in the door.",
      "Luckin did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Rapid growth in Asia",
      "Since launching in 2017, Luckin has scaled rapidly to over 24,000 stores, with locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, according to a recent financial report. Despite hiccups, including an accounting fraud scandal, and $475 million in losses last year as the company poured hundreds of millions of dollars into coffee beans, store rent and other costs, Luckin's profit margins have rapidly ballooned. This past quarter, the coffee chain made $1.2 million in revenue, a 41% increase from the year prior.",
      "The store's app-based concept, contrived by founder Jenny Zhiya Qian, was intended to echo that of a ride-hailing business, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "To purchase an item, Luckin customers browse the coffee store's menu and make payments directly online. This is a \"100% cashier-less environment,\" Luckin states\u00a0on its website, adding that the app-based store model is intended to maximize efficiency and keep costs low. The company's beverages in China are 30% cheaper than Starbucks beverages in the country, according to CNN.",
      "Luckin's menu offers a range of drinks from traditional items like matcha and lattes to more unconventional choices like its \"fruity Americano\" series. It also has a small pastry menu including a banana yogurt loaf,\u00a0 chocolate-chip cookie and a sausage, egg and cheese croissant, among other offerings.",
      "Competition with Starbucks",
      "Luckin's entr\u00e9e into the U.S. coffee market is a direct challenge to Starbucks, which is in the midst of revamping its brand image through the \"Back to Starbucks\" campaign as it struggles against declining sales and revenue.",
      "With more than 17,000\u00a0locations across the country, Starbucks has the upper hand in the U.S. In China, however, the Seattle-based coffee giant lost its hold to Luckin in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "Significantly cheaper menu items and a convenient in-app ordering model boded well for Luckin in China, though it remains to be seen if the same exact strategy will be applied in the U.S. market.",
      "A quick glance at Luckin's in-app menu shows that prices on key items are more or less on par with those at U.S. Starbucks stores. A 16-ounce drip coffee at Luckin, for instance, goes for $3.45 compared with $3.65 at Starbucks. A 16-ounce iced matcha, meanwhile, costs $6.45 at Luckin, or 20 cents more than the $6.25 equivalent at Starbucks. A bagel at both companies goes for $3.25.",
      "According to Luckin, the company has over 120 million registered app users. That's far more than Starbucks, which also offers customers the ability to order via app. In January, the Seattle-based company said it had 34 million people in its membership rewards program, which is run through the app and online.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of workers across more than a dozen cities and states will soon receive higher pay, thanks to minimum wage hikes set to take effect July 1.",
      "More than 800,000 workers in two states \u2014Alaska and Oregon \u2014 as well as Washington, D.C., will be impacted by higher minimum wages that go into effect July 1, according to the left-leaning economic think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.",
      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\"",
      "About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.",
      "For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.",
      "While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.",
      "Pay hikes in Alaska, D.C., and Oregon",
      "Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.",
      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations.",
      "Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.",

      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock - the names of the previous teams - would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",

      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\"",

    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said late Sunday trade talks with U.S. have resumed after Canada rescinded its plan to tax U.S. technology firms.",
      "President Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called \"a direct and blatant attack on our country.\"",
      "The Canadian government said \"in anticipation\" of a trade deal \"Canada would rescind\" the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.",
      "Carney and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume negotiations.",
      "\"Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,\" Carney said in a statement.",
      "Carney visited Mr. Trump in May at the White House and was polite but firm. Mr. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.",
      "The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a \"clear victory\" for the president.",
      "\"At some point, this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "He said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump's outbursts.",
      "\"President Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executives will be very happy with this outcome,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday.",
      "\"Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,\" Champagne said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the president poking at the nation's northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.",
      "Canada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on goods from Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the expiration of the 90-day negotiating period he set.",
      "Canada and Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Mr. Trump put into place under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed during Mr. Trump's first term.",

    "summary": "He's the son of an immigrant family who fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. He's also the chief executive officer of Uber. He talks about the road to high-tech success, and about unsettling times for a nation of immigrants.",
    "story": [
      "It's rare to sit down with a CEO and the CEO's mother. The proud mom is Lili Khosrowshahi; her son, Dara, is behind the wheel at Uber as its chief executive. \"I actually say he works for Uber,\" said Lili. \"Sometimes I say he drives, he's a driver.\"",
      "They sat down with us to share their family's immigration story. In 1978, the Khosrowshahis fled Tehran and the Iranian revolution. \"We were forced to leave Iran \u2013 it wasn't our decision,\" Lili said. \"It was done in a day.\"",
      "Dara's father ran a family business which made them wealthy, but also, they say, a target. \"You don't sit around saying, 'Well, let's plan as a family for a revolution,' right? It just never occurs to you,\" Dara said. \"We lost everything.\"",
      "\"We came from a much better life to a smaller life,\" said Lili. \"At the time, coffee was 15 cents, and I wouldn't even buy a cup of coffee. In fact, I don't pay for Starbucks coffee to this day.\"",
      "\"Mama, Starbucks is a customer of Uber Eats. You gotta talk it up!\" Dara interjected. \"I love Starbucks, personally!\"",
      "\"I'll let you pay,\" said Mom.",
      "It's that easy-going, yet strategic tone that Khosrowshahi brought to Uber. Launched in 2009, the company transformed how millions get around. When Khosrowshahi took charge in 2017, Uber was infamous for a toxic work culture and a growth-at-all-costs approach.",
      "When he took over, his job was described as \"one of the worst clean-up jobs in the history of American capitalism.\"",
      "\"Well, I think it was a little over-dramatized,\" said Khosrowshahi. \"But it was true that I had to come in and change the culture of the company. And I do think that the company, in hindsight, was too aggressive in certain ways. And I think now we get it right more than we get it wrong.\"",
      "Still, Uber is defending itself in lawsuits over its billing practices and passenger safety.",
      "Then, there's the company's relationship with President Donald Trump. Eight years ago, Khosrowshahi was CEO of Expedia \u2013 and condemned Mr. Trump's so-called Muslim ban. Today, he's one of many CEOs now engaging with President Trump.",
      "\"I do think that, as a CEO of a U.S. company, you want the country to succeed,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And so, that means supporting whatever administration is in power. You're gonna have your disagreements. You're gonna have your agreements. We have to navigate through a period of a strong economy, but at the same time, significant uncertainty.\"",
      "I asked, \"Isn't a lot of that uncertainty caused by this president?\"",
      "\"Uncertainty comes with change,\" he replied. \"And I think the president ran on a mandate for change. As CEOs, as companies, you know, we have to adjust to that environment that we see.\"",
      "And Uber is adjusting. Last month it announced new, cheaper ride options. Route Share matches riders with other passengers along pre-set commutes.",
      "\"This feels kind of like a glorified carpool?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, what is old is new again,\" said Khosrowshahi.",
      "\"We have heard from a lot of riders that Uber rides have gotten a lot more expensive over the past few years, more than the rate of inflation \u2013 what's happening here?\"",
      "\"Well, I think it is about inflation,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"And the average Uber ride is now a little over $20. Our drivers need to make a living, and so really the demand for drivers and pay has gone up, and that translates into the ultimate price of the Uber ride.\"",
      "Concerns over driver pay and benefits persist \u2026 even as Khosrowshahi's own compensation has surged, to about $40 million a year.",
      "Asked what people should make of that, Khosrowshahi said, \"We as a society, I think as a country, clearly, we've done unbelievably well economically. But I do think that the inequality that you see as it relates to the top end compensation, like someone who's lucky enough like me, and the middle class, et cetera, that is too big a chasm, in my opinion.\"",
      "Too big of a gap? \"Yeah. I do think it's too big of a gap. Now, I don't have a solution for it.\"",
      "It's a gap that may be getting even bigger.",
      "This past week, Uber expanded its robotaxi service to Atlanta, launching rides in self-driving Waymos.",
      "Khosrowshahi said, \"Everyone wants on-demand transportation, food, et cetera. So, we see actually AV [Autonomous Vehicle] and human driving can grow for the next five to 10 years.\"",
      "\"You don't think human driver numbers will decrease?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not in the next five to 10 years,\" he replied. \"Then, we will need to adjust as a society.\"",
      "For now, robotaxis are neither cheaper nor faster than a human driver. But Khosrowshahi says they are as safe as can be. \"Certainly the statistics bear it out,\" he said.",
      "Khosrowshahi is focused on the road ahead, but his past is never far behind. When he was a teen, his father returned to Iran for what he thought would be a short visit \u2026 but the government wouldn't let him leave.",
      "Lili said, \"For the six years that your father was away, you never even mentioned his name. And I told you that Daddy was free to come, and you started crying like crazy. I mean, you couldn't stop crying. So, you know, you had learned to just hide your feelings. But as immigrants, we all learned to hide our feelings.\"",
      "Emotional, Dara requested a break from the interview. \"I don't remember the particular moment,\" he said. \"but I remember the time. And I think, you know, Mom's totally right. You adjust to the situation to your best.\"",
      "\"Adjust\" \u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi keeps coming back to that word, in work and in life.",
      "I asked, \"You have said, 'We came at a time that was welcoming to immigrants.' Is that still the case right now?\"",
      "\"I think, you know, we're going through a transition now as a nation,\" he replied. \"There's a reset going on in terms of making sure that immigration here is proper, is legal. It's difficult for a lot of people. But my hope is that we remain the kind of country that attracts the best and the brightest who want to build a life here. And  hopefully, I can help others live the same dream that I have.\"",

    "summary": "Tens of millions of Americans are unable to save for retirement through their jobs. \"That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis,\" one expert says.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

      "Posting on Truth Social\u00a0on Friday afternoon, the president said the U.S. will let Canada know what their tariff rate will be in the next week. The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",
      "\"We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" the president wrote. \"They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also.

    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, according to the PCE data. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, up from a rate of 2.5% the previous month.",
      "While inflation ticked higher, prices across the U.S. haven't yet shown a major impact from the Trump administration's tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that inflation could reignite this summer as the import duties are passed through to consumers.",
      "Consumers also pared their spending last month, marking their first reduction since January, while incomes also dropped, the Commerce Department\u00a0said\u00a0on Friday. The pullback in spending, which dropped 0.1% last month, comes after Americans opened their wallets earlier in the year to buy goods before the tariffs took effect, economists said.",
      "\"While the spending numbers fell slightly and came in below expectations, we would not read too much into these numbers as this weakness is probably primarily just payback from the jump in spending earlier this year as consumers tried to buy goods ahead of the tariffs,\" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Incomes dropped after a one-time adjustment to Social Security benefits had boosted payments in March and April. Social Security payments were raised for some retirees who had worked for state and local governments due to the Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "Modest impact from tariffs",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Trump's broad-based tariffs are still having only a modest effect on prices. The cost of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month's 0.1%.",
      "Economists point to several reasons why Trump's tariffs have yet to accelerate the pace of inflation, as many analysts had expected. Like American consumers, companies imported billions of dollars of goods in the spring before the duties kicked in, and many items currently on store shelves were imported without paying higher levies.",
      "Some businesses are also absorbing higher import costs, cushioning consumers from price hikes.",
      "\"For the moment, there is nothing of consequence to worry about on the inflation side of this report,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients in a research note. \"There is, however, an unexpected drop in consumer spending, the first since the pandemic.

      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "Details on the wedding location of have remained under wraps, but Italian papers and Venetian locals predict it will take place Friday on San Giorgio Maggiore.

      "The reception is expected to be held on Saturday at Arsenale, a sprawling brick complex and former shipyard that was used from the 12th century until World War I. It's best known today as one of the main venues for the Biennale cultural festivals, which include exhibitions on art, architecture, film, dance, music and theater.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "The event has put a spotlight on the uber-weathly, with local protestors pushing back against the event's extravagance.",
      "\"Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,\" Stella Faye, a university researcher from Venice,\u00a0told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "According to a new Oxfam report, the world's richest 1% have increased their wealth by more than $33.9 trillion since 2015.

Last week, protesters gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",
      "The legal battle at the Supreme Court started in 2022 when a group of consumers, a carrier and the nonprofit Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say.",
      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "U.S., China economies both feeling trade disputes' effects",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",
      "Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials have indicated they expect to reach trade deals with many other countries, including India.",

      "The market could surpass those previous records on Friday or early next week, analysts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street has largely shrugged off concerns about tariffs and geopolitical tensions since early April, although there have been periods of volatility along the way. While these issues continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, many investors are confident they'll skirt any major market downturns, at least in the short-term, experts say.",
      "\"We hear all those narratives of what could go wrong, or what is going wrong,\" said Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro. \"But the market doesn't seem to care. It's looking forward. It's plowing ahead, and it's been trading really well.\"",
      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",
      "\"I think investors are kind of looking through the next several months to a period in which we're likely to see more accommodative monetary policy,\" said Luschini.",

      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",

      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",
      "Sweet noted that he'll be looking Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, because it will \"show how the revisions impacted the trajectory of consumption headed into this quarter.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 05:00:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday that it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn't contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers' changing nutritional needs and preferences. \"We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers.

    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration informed Harvard University on Monday that it found the elite school violated federal civil rights law through its treatment of Jewish and Israeli students on campus and warned that a failure by the university to enact certain changes \"immediately\" would put at risk its federal financial resources.",
      "Top Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as the General Services Administration, notified Harvard of the findings of an investigation into alleged antisemitism at the school and concluded that it is in \"violent violation\" of a provision of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs that receive federal assistance.",
      "\"Harvard's commitment to racial hierarchies \u2014 where individuals are sorted and judged according to their membership in an oppressed group identity and not individual merit \u2014 has enabled anti-Semitism to fester on Harvard's campus and has led a once great institution to humiliation, offering remedial math and forcing Jewish students to hide their identities and ancestral stories,\" the administration officials, which make up the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, wrote.",
      "They warned that a failure to \"institute adequate changes immediately\" would lead to a loss of federal financial resources to Harvard and \"continue to affect\" the university's relationship with the federal government.",
      "Harvard said in response to the investigation's conclusion that it has made \"significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias\" and is committed to \"ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard.\"",
      "\"Antisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable. Harvard has taken substantive, proactive steps to address the root causes of antisemitism in its community,\" the university said in a statement. \"In responding to the government's investigation, Harvard not only shared its comprehensive and retrospective Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias Report but also outlined the ways that it has strengthened policies, disciplined those who violate them, encouraged civil discourse, and promoted open, respectful dialogue. Harvard is far from indifferent on this issue and strongly disagrees with the government's findings.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been engaged in an ongoing battle with Harvard and mounted efforts to punish the school on multiple fronts. Agencies have frozen billions of dollars in grants and contracts to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university and revoked its ability to enroll foreign students. Harvard has sued the administration over its efforts, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the moves related to international students. President Trump has also threatened to revoke\u00a0Harvard's tax-exempt status, and the university is facing numerous investigations from across the federal government.",
      "Many of the sanctions stem from what administration officials have said is the school's failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But the Trump administration has also taken aim at Harvard's hiring and admissions practices, and in April, it made a series of 10 demands in a letter to university leadership. Among the changes government officials said Harvard needs to undertake are a discontinuation of its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies; implementation of merit-based admissions and hiring policies; and disclosure of all foreign funding sources.",
      "Harvard bucked the administration's demands, which its president, Alan Garber, said exceed the power of the federal government.",
      "In its latest letter to Garber related to the civil rights investigation, led by the Office for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal officials accused Harvard of \"being among the most prominent and visible breeding ground for race discrimination.\" They cited the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that ended affirmative action programs in higher education, which arose from a challenge to Harvard's policies.",
      "\"Any institution that refuses to meet its duties under federal law may not receive a wide range of federal privileges,\" they said.",
      "The letter is signed by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights; Sean Keveney, acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services; Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner for Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration; and Thomas Wheeler, acting general counsel at the Department of Education.",
      "The officials said its investigation found that a quarter of Jewish students felt physically unsafe on the Ivy League campus, and Jewish and Israeli students were assaulted and spit on. They also cited a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on Harvard Yard last year that \"instilled fear in, and disrupted the studies of, Jewish and Israeli students.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it found that \"Harvard has been in some cases deliberately indifferent, and in others has been a willful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff.\"",
      "Amid the ongoing fight with Harvard, Mr. Trump\u00a0hinted earlier this month that his administration had been in talks with the university, writing on social media that it was \"very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate kicked off a \"vote-a-rama\" on President Trump's massive tax bill Monday, beginning what's expected to be a marathon session after the chamber debated the bill into the wee hours of the morning as Republicans work to pass the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",
      "The House narrowly passed the bill last month, and Senate Republicans have been working to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber. The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed.",
      "The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP nears a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the deadline. Titled \"One Big, Beautiful Bill,\" the legislation includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which is offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Sunday that the legislation would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation\u00a0late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts. The vote on the motion to proceed stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders. Some tweaks were made to the bill before Republicans ultimately received enough votes to move forward.",
      "Senate Democrats further delayed the legislation's path forward by forcing the bill to be read in its entirety, starting late Saturday. After nearly 16 hours, the Senate clerks concluded their reading of the bill on the floor, starting the clock on debate. Each side then had up to 10 hours for debate.",
      "The \"vote-a-rama\"",
      "Following debate, and a break until the morning, the Senate is beginning what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators may offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats are expected to use the opportunity to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "But before the chamber could get to the amendment votes, senators had to address an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune maneuvered Sunday to allow the use of the current policy baseline, before Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly appealed the move, requesting a vote as Democrats railed against it as the \"nuclear option.\" The chamber voted 53-47, along party lines, to affirm the use of the current policy baseline on Monday.",
      "Schumer said that Democrats would bring \"one amendment after the other\" Monday, and began the process by offering an amendment to send the bill back to the Finance Committee to revisit some of its health care provisions. The chamber voted down the amendment in a party-line vote.",
      "The path to passage",
      "Senate Republicans have been pursuing the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. With only a simple majority required to advance the measure, rather than the 60-votes needed to move forward with most legislation, Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill's progress.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support from three Republicans \u2014 and would then still require a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. And although a number of senators who had expressed opposition to the measure ultimately decided to advance it Saturday, how they will vote on the measure in a final form remains unclear.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and are expected to oppose the legislation on final passage. Tillis, who announced Sunday that he is not seeking reelection, took to the Senate floor that night to outline his opposition to some of the bill's cuts to Medicaid, claiming \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care\" and arguing that the GOP is \"betraying our promise.\"",
      "\"It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made\" to target only waste, fraud and abuse in the entitlement program, Tillis said, claiming that the president has been \"misinformed\"",
      "The North Carolina Republican argued that the July 4 deadline is an \"artificial\" one, saying Senate Republicans are rushing, while encouraging the chamber to \"take the time to get this right\" and align more closely with the House's Medicaid provisions.",
      "But Senate GOP leaders are still moving ahead. Thune, a South Dakota Republican, delivered a defense of the bill on the Senate floor ahead of the vote-a-rama Monday, pushing back on criticism over Medicaid cuts, the impact on the deficit and the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "\"Let's vote,\" Thune said. \"This is good for America.\"",
      "When asked whether he's confident Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the legislation, the majority leader told reporters, \"Never, until we vote.\"",
      "Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote Saturday, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. Still, the vice president met with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday as the White House put pressure on lawmakers to get the bill across the finish line. And his vote may be needed to get the legislation across the finish line.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, warned Sunday that the legislation would be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, while suggesting that the bill could even lose support among the GOP, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-in-trump-big-beautiful-bill-senate-version/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:59:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Republicans released an updated version of the legislation late Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "The Senate voted Saturday to advance the measure, overcoming a key hurdle as the upper chamber works toward final passage, and will vote on amendments and then the overall bill on Monday.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "Pause on AI regulations",
      "A revised proposal on a 10-year pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:49:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration and Republicans have argued that the limits on coordinated spending violate the First Amendment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether federal limits on coordinated spending by political parties in support of their candidates violate the First Amendment.",
      "The court's review of an appeals court ruling that upheld the coordinated spending limits set up a high-stakes campaign finance dispute that will be heard in the court's next term, with a decision expected just months before the 2026 midterm elections. The Supreme Court allowed the Democratic National Committee and other party committees to intervene and participate in the case, since the Justice Department has joined the GOP in calling on the court to strike down the restrictions as unconstitutional.",
      "The case is likely to join a string of recent rulings from the Supreme Court's conservative majority that have unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, allowing more money to flow into politics. In its landmark 2010 decision in the case Citizens United v. FEC, the justices struck down prohibitions on political spending by corporations. Four years later, the high court invalidated a limit on the amount of money a donor could contribute to federal candidates in a two-year election cycle.",
      "In the latest case, which involved GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that a cap on the amount of post-election contributions that can be used to repay a candidate who loaned money to their own campaign was unconstitutional.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court now, brought by Republican political committees and JD Vance when he was a candidate for the Senate, involves a 50-year-old provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio challenged the constitutionality of the coordinated party expenditure limits. Chabot lost his reelection bid in November 2022.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. The composition of the high court has changed significantly in the 24 years since that decision, and it now has a 6-3 conservative majority. Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the 2001 ruling, is the only justice who is still on the court.",
      "In its decision, the 6th Circuit's 10-judge majority acknowledged that \"the law and facts have changed\" since the 2001 ruling and said \"political campaigns and political spending have changed in the last two decades.\"",
      "The Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment. They are represented by two lawyers with ties to President Trump: Noel Francisco, who was solicitor general during his first term, and Don McGahn, who served as White House counsel.",
      "\"Congress has built a wall of separation between party and candidate, forcing party committees to figure out how to get their candidates elected without hearing from them,\" they wrote in their appeal. \"That is the campaign 'equivalent of prohibiting communication between a coach and quarterback late in a tied game.'\"",
      "The Republicans urged the Supreme Court to either clarify its 2001 decision upholding the spending limits or overrule it outright, calling it an \"aberration\" that was \"plainly wrong the day it was decided.\"",
      "Because political parties cannot coordinate with their candidates, the GOP committees said donors are directing more of their money to outside groups like superPACs.",
      "\"The result is a more polarized process in which political parties \u2014 an institutional force almost as old as 'the formation of the Republic itself' \u2014 have been supplanted by less-restricted speakers,\" they said.",
      "Backing the Republicans in their appeal is the Trump administration, which is not defending the law before the Supreme Court. In a May filing with the justices, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the government agrees that the expenditure limits violate the First Amendment by restricting parties' right to engage in political speech in coordination with their candidates.",
      "\"The core function of a political party is to promote its candidates to the electorate. A party performs that function most effectively in cooperation with the candidates themselves,\" Sauer wrote. \"By restricting that cooperation, the party-expenditure limit severely burdens the rights of parties and candidates alike.\"",
      "The Justice Department has a longstanding policy of defending federal statutes facing constitutional challenges, but Sauer said it determined \"this is the rare case that warrants an exception to that general approach.\"",
      "Because the government sided with the Republicans in arguing that the limits should be invalidated, Democratic Party committees sought to intervene because there was no one to defend the law and the 6th Circuit's decision. The Justice Department did not oppose their intervention.",

    "story": [
      "Toronto \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said late Sunday trade talks with U.S. have resumed after Canada rescinded its plan to tax U.S. technology firms.",
      "President Trump said Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called \"a direct and blatant attack on our country.\"",
      "The Canadian government said \"in anticipation\" of a trade deal \"Canada would rescind\" the Digital Serves Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday.",
      "Carney and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume negotiations.",
      "\"Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,\" Carney said in a statement.",
      "Carney visited Mr. Trump in May at the White House and was polite but firm. Mr. Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in Alberta, where Carney said Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day deadline for trade talks.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on his social media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in Canada.",
      "The digital services tax was due to hit companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Carney's retreat a \"clear victory\" for the president.",
      "\"At some point, this move might have become necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations themselves but Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President Trump and have him agree to simply resume these negotiations, which is a clear victory for both the White House and big tech,\" B\u00e9land said.",
      "He said it makes Carney look vulnerable to President Trump's outbursts.",
      "\"President Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech executives will be very happy with this outcome,\" B\u00e9land said.",

      "\"Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress,\" Champagne said in a statement.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's launched since taking office for a second term in January. Progress with Canada has been a roller coaster, starting with the president poking at the nation's northern neighbor and repeatedly suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state.",
      "Canada and the U.S. have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on goods from Canada.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration eliminated the CDC team that developed national guidelines for prescribing contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions.",
    "story": [
      "For Brianna Henderson, birth control isn't just about preventing pregnancy.",
      "The Texas mother of two was diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal heart condition after having her second child. In addition to avoiding another pregnancy that could be life-threatening, Henderson has to make sure the contraception she uses doesn't jeopardize her health.",
      "For more than a decade, a small team of people at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked to do just that, issuing national guidelines for clinicians on how to prescribe contraception safely for millions of women with underlying medical conditions \u2014 including heart disease, lupus, sickle cell disease, and obesity. But the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, fired those workers as part of the Trump administration's rapid downsizing of the federal workforce.",
      "It also decimated the CDC's larger Division of Reproductive Health, where the team was housed \u2014 a move that clinicians, advocacy groups, and fired workers say will endanger the health of women and their babies.",
      "Clinicians said in interviews that counseling patients about birth control and prescribing it is relatively straightforward. But for women with conditions that put them at higher risk of serious health complications, special care is needed.",
      "\"We really were the only source of safety monitoring in this country,\" said one fired CDC staffer who worked on the guidelines, known as the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, or MEC. \"There's no one who can actually do this work.\" KFF Health News agreed not to name this worker and others who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.",
      "The stakes are high for people like Henderson. About six weeks after having her second baby, she said, her heart \"was racing.\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm underwater,\" Henderson said. \"I felt like I couldn't breathe.\" She eventually went to the hospital, where she was told she was \"in full-blown heart failure,\" she said.",
      "Henderson was diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy, an uncommon type of heart failure that can happen toward the end of pregnancy or shortly after giving birth. Risk factors for the condition include being at least 30 years old, being of African descent, high blood pressure, and obesity.",
      "The CDC contraception guidelines say that combined hormonal contraception, which contains both estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy, can pose an \"unacceptable health risk\" for most women with peripartum cardiomyopathy, also known as PPCM. For some women with the diagnosis, a birth control injection commonly known by the brand name Depo-Provera also carries risks that outweigh its benefits, the guidelines show. Progestin-only pills or a birth control implant, inserted into a person's arm, are the safest.",
      "Henderson said her cardiologist had to greenlight which contraception she could use. She uses a progestin-only birth control implant that's more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.",
      "\"I didn't know that certain things can cause blood clots,\" Henderson said, \"or make your heart failure worse.\" Heart failure is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity in the U.S., with PPCM accounting for up to 70% of heart failure cases during pregnancy.",
      "Sweeping HHS layoffs in late March and early April gutted the CDC's reproductive health division, upending several programs designed to protect women and infants, three fired workers said.",
      "About two-thirds of the division's roughly 165 employees and contractors were cut, through firings, retirements, or reassignments to other parts of the agency, one worker said.",
      "Among those fired were CDC staffers who carried out the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes by asking detailed questions of women who recently gave birth. The survey was used \"to help inform and help reduce the contributing factors that cause maternal mortality and morbidity,\" one fired worker said, by allowing government workers to examine the medical care people received before and during pregnancy, if any, and other risk factors that may lead to poor maternal and child health.",
      "The firings also removed CDC workers who collected and analyzed data on in vitro fertilization and other fertility treatments.",
      "\"They left nothing behind,\" one worker said.",
      "U.S. contraception guidelines were first published in 2010, after the CDC adapted guidance developed by the World Health Organization. The latest version was published in August 2024. It includes information about the safety of different types of contraception for more than 60 medical conditions. Clinicians said it is the premier source of evidence about the safety of birth control.",
      "\"It gave us so much information which was not available to clinicians at their fingertips,\" said Michael Policar, a physician and professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco School of Medicine.",
      "\"If you've got a person with, let's say, long-standing Type 2 diabetes, someone who has a connective-tissue disease like lupus, someone who's got hypertension or maybe has been treated for a precursor to breast cancer \u2014 something like that? In those circumstances,\" Policar said, \"before the MEC it was really hard to know how to manage those people.\"",
      "The CDC updates the guidelines comprehensively roughly every five years. On a weekly basis, however, government workers would monitor evidence about patients' use of contraception and the safety of various methods, something they were doing when HHS abruptly fired them this spring, two fired workers said. That work isn't happening now, one of them said.",
      "Sometimes the agency would issue interim changes outside the larger updates if new evidence warranted it. Now, if something new or urgent comes up, \"there's not going to be any way to update the guidelines,\" one fired worker said.",
      "In 2020, for example, the CDC revised its contraception recommendations for women at high risk of HIV infection, after new evidence showed that various methods were safer than previously thought.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard declined to say why CDC personnel working on the contraception guidelines and other reproductive health issues were fired, or answer other questions raised by KFF Health News' reporting.",
      "Most women of reproductive age in the U.S. use contraception. CDC data from 2019, the most recent available, shows that more than 47 million women ages 15 to 49 relied on birth control. About 1 in 10 used long-acting methods such as intrauterine devices and implants; 1 in 7 used oral contraception.",
      "The latest guidelines included updated safety recommendations for women who have sickle cell disease, lupus, or PPCM, and those who are breastfeeding, among others. Clinicians are now being told that combined hormonal contraception poses an unacceptable health risk for women with sickle cell disease, because it might increase the risk of blood clots.",
      "\"It can really come down to life or death,\" said Teonna Woolford, CEO of the Sickle Cell Reproductive Health Education Directive, a nonprofit that advocates for improved reproductive health care for people with the disease.",
      "\"We really saw the CDC guidelines as a win, as a victory \u2014 they're actually going to pay attention,\" she said.",
      "The 2024 guidelines also for the first time included birth control recommendations for women with chronic kidney disease. Research has shown that such women are at higher risk of serious pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia and preterm delivery. Their medical condition also increases their risk of blood clots, which is why it's important for them to not use combined hormonal contraception, fired CDC workers and clinicians said.",
      "The CDC information \"is the final say in safety,\" said Patty Cason, a family nurse practitioner and president of Envision Sexual and Reproductive Health. Having only static information about the safety of various types of birth control is \"very scary,\" she said, because new evidence could come out and entirely new methods of contraception are being developed.",
      "Henderson said it took her heart two years to recover. She created the nonprofit organization Let's Talk PPCM to educate women about the type of heart failure she was diagnosed with, including what forms of birth control are safe.",
      "\"We don't want blood clots, worsening heart failures,\" Henderson said. \"They already feel like they can't trust their doctors, and we don't need extra.\"",

    "summary": "Democrats found themselves locked out of power in Washington after the 2024 presidential election. Now campaign groups are readying an effort to help the party regain power.",
    "story": [
      "An alliance of leading national Democratic groups is preparing a new effort this summer focused on driving voter engagement as the party tries to regain support following its defeats in 2024.",
      "The plans, first obtained by CBS News, fall under the label of what these groups have dubbed \"Organizing Summer.\" While this year has relatively few major statewide elections,\u00a0 such as gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the 2026 midterms will be a crucial test for a party that is trying to respond to the lessons learned from Republicans' wins in last year's campaigns, including the presidential race. The groups behind the summer organizing effort include the Democratic National Committee,\u00a0 the Democrats' coalition of state parties as well as the campaign arms for House, Senate and gubernatorial contests.",
      "The DNC alone intends to initially invest a six-figure dollar amount in the wide-ranging effort, with plans to scale to seven figures as the summer goes on.",
      "\"For too long, the DNC has been a D.C. institution, and we're trying to get the DNC out of DC and into the states through this program,\" a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans said.",
      "The summer program is focused on voter engagement and registration, particularly with voters who wouldn't otherwise hear Democrats' messaging. The DNC has signed up 16,000 volunteers, twice as many as it typically has in an off-election year, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. As part of the summer effort, Democrats will urge volunteers to connect with voters in less politically dominated parts of life, with the outline of the plan pointing to community groups, book clubs and social media platforms as examples.",
      "The plans include developing a \"direct pathway to share feedback they receive from voters, and what they are seeing online, helping the party inform its messaging and strategy on an ongoing basis,\" according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the program.",
      "\"We are deploying an army of thousands of volunteers to activate their communities, register voters, and make sure the Republicans who are putting billionaires ahead of working and middle class Americans lose their elections in 2025 and lose their seats in the midterms,\" DNC chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.",
      "National Democrats are also keen on trying to build momentum after party infighting spilled out into the open during the early months of Martin's tenure leading the DNC.",
      "An April announcement from activist David Hogg and his political organization, Leaders We Deserve,\u00a0 detailing plans to \"start primarying out-of-touch, ineffective House Democrats in solid blue seats\" caused a rift with Martin and other party leaders. This eventually led to Hogg losing his position as a DNC vice chair. Soon after that standoff ended, attention grew around\u00a0two leaders from major labor unions exiting the DNC, bringing about more questions about the direction of the party moving forward.",
      "Many Democrats have been uneasy about the infighting, wanting to focus instead on trying to win elections in the coming months and years.",
      "In an attempt to help do that, Democrats' summer initiative includes all\u00a035 of the GOP districts\u00a0the House Democrats' campaign arm is focusing on at this stage, U.S. Senate races in North Carolina and Maine and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, according to the Democratic strategist familiar with the plans.",
      "Democrats are already attempting to use\u00a0 President Trump's wide-ranging\u00a0 \"big, beautiful bill\" making its way through Congress as a flashpoint in the midterms, and that work will also be a major point of the summer organizing program.",
      "The GOP House version of the legislation, which narrowly passed the chamber,\u00a0continues\u00a0major parts of Mr. Trump's first term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet it also includes more politically volatile changes, such as enforcing Medicaid work requirements and changes to federal food assistance. Senate Republicans have been working to try and pass their own version of the bill as well. As the process plays out, national Republicans already appear to be centering a major part of the GOP's chances in the 2026 midterms on Mr. Trump's agenda legislation.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes common-sense policies supported by a majority of Americans,\" House GOP campaign arm chairman Richard Hudson\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media recently. \"@HouseGOP Republicans are putting Americans first while Democrats defend the waste, fraud, abuse, and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Last year's elections sent Republicans to Washington with unified control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, giving them clear paths to act on Mr. Trump's agenda. Democrats are facing a difficult map to try and reclaim the Senate in 2026, meaning that the left's best hopes at gaining power back in Washington are likely centered on winning back the House next year. Since Mr. Trump's second inauguration, Democratic governors have proven to be a major counter to his actions, meaning that either maintaining or winning governor's offices around the country is a critical goal for the party as well. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for instance, sued Trump and others earlier this month over the\u00a0federal deployment\u00a0of state National Guard members following immigration protests.",
      "Whether efforts like the summer organizing will be enough to help the party moving forward is likely to be closely watched among politicians and operatives looking to build campaigns not just for the 2026 midterms, but the 2028 presidential election cycle as well.",
      "\"Our job this summer is to make sure working families know exactly who is responsible for taking food off their table and ripping away their health care,\" Martin said in his statement.",

    "summary": "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis announced Sunday that he won't seek reelection in 2026, opening up a key seat in North Carolina.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced Sunday that he won't seek reelection in 2026, hours after President Trump threatened to back a primary challenge against him when he refused to support his massive spending and tax bill which he dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election,\" Tillis said in a statement Sunday. He noted that he hasn't \"been excited about running for another term,\" citing the choice between \"spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington\" or spending time with his family.",
      "The North Carolina Republican was first elected to the Senate in 2014, and speculation has swirled for weeks around whether he would seek another term. The announcement came hours after Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social criticizing Tillis for his opposition to some of the provisions within the massive tax legislation making its way through the Senate, while the president said he would be meeting with possible primary opponents to run against Tillis, \"looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina.\"",
      "Tillis had said earlier Sunday that he could not support the legislation, which is the centerpiece of the president's second-term agenda, due to Medicaid cuts \"that would be devastating to North Carolina.\"",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor Sunday night, Tillis said, \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care and betraying a promise. It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made in the Oval Office or in the Cabinet Room when I was there with Finance, where he said we can go after waste, fraud and abuse on any programs.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters after his comments, he also took issue with the way the bill is being moved forward, saying, \"If you've got to surprise or jam your conference to get something done, you're a pretty sh***y legislator.\"",
      "The senator also outlined his thoughts about Washington in recent years in his earlier statement Sunday: \"It's become increasingly evident that leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species.\"",
      "In an apparent nod to former Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Tillis said \"Democrats recently lost two such leaders who were dedicated to making the Senate more of a functional and productive legislative body.\" He added that \"their presence in the Senate chamber has been sorely missed every day since\" they opted not to seek reelection.",
      "\"It underscores the greatest form of hypocrisy in American politics,\" Tillis continued. \"When people see independent thinking on the other side, they cheer. But when those very same people see independent thinking coming from their side, they scorn, ostracize, and even censure them.\"",
      "The announcement will open up a key seat in North Carolina, which has historically voted for Republicans in every presidential race, with the exception of Barack Obama in 2008.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"has won North Carolina three times, and the state's been represented by two Republican Senators for over a decade.\"",
      "\"That streak will continue in 2026 when North Carolinians elect a conservative leader committed to advancing an agenda of opportunity, prosperity, and security,\" Scott said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iran-nuclear-enrichment-iaea-rafaeal-marino-grossi-face-the-nation-interivew/",
    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 21:22:58 -0400",
    "summary": "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
    "story": [
      "Iran's nuclear capabilities suffered \"severe damage\" in last week's U.S. airstrikes but not \"total damage,\" said the man in charge of the world's global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"One cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.\"",
      "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"",
      "The U.S. launched three strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 21, following more than a week of Israeli attacks, which President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "But Grossi's comments appeared to support an early assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. The Trump administration has slammed the DIA's assessment as \"low confidence,\" and Hegseth and other officials on Thursday went after the media for reporting on a \"leaked\" report.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, reporters questioned Hegseth repeatedly on whether Iran had moved its stocks of enriched uranium before the Israeli and U.S. strikes began. The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",
      "Iravani added that he did not think the enrichment will \"ever stop.\"",

    "summary": "FBI crime reports reviewed by CBS News show assaults or attacks against people at churches, synagogues, temples and mosques surged nearly 100% between 2021 and 2023.",
    "story": [
      "Alan Hausman paused mid-sentence during the phone call, then said he is still dogged by \"survivor's remorse.\"",
      "Hausman said he can clearly remember trying to drive up a road to get to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh after he was alerted to a shooting. But the road was impassable. The memories of the aftermath are indelible.",
      "\"Every time I see another attack, it's like someone picked the scab off of my wound,\" said Hausman, who is the president of the synagogue's board of directors. He was not attending the synagogue on the day of the October 2018 shooting spree that killed 11 people.",
      "The massacre resulted in 63 counts including hate crime charges, resulting in the\u00a0conviction and a death sentence against the gunman.",
      "Hausman, who is an emergency management official in Pittsburgh, said the Tree of Life now has armed security, as do other religious institutions and organizations in the city and region. The houses of worship have installed new alarm systems, and have roving security guards in parking lots, to deter future threats, he said.",
      "According to FBI data and Justice Department officials who spoke with CBS News, the Tree of Life tragedy didn't slow the targeting of religious institutions, but was an early warning of the recent wave of planned attacks.",
      "FBI crime reports reviewed by CBS News show assaults or attacks against people at churches, synagogues, temples and mosques surged nearly 100% between 2021 and 2023.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon referenced a growing stack on her desk of criminal cases that allege the targeting of religious centers.",
      "\"I think it's a form of terrorism, because attacks on churches are meant to terrorize people,\" Dhillon said. \"And they're meant to deter people from going there. And so it makes everyone feel unsafe.\"",
      "On June 18, Justice Department prosecutors secured a 25-year prison term in the case of Rui Zhang of Virginia. Zhang was convicted of targeting a Haymarket, Virginia, church for an attack. Prosecutors alleged Zhang had written a manifesto, and that he was inside a Sunday service at the church with a semiautomatic handgun, two magazines of ammunition, and two knives. He allegedly had additional ammunition, knives, and a canister of bear spray in his nearby car.",
      "In April, the Justice Department also secured a conviction of an Arizona man of targeting a series of churches. According to investigators, Zimnako Saleh \"traveled to four Christian churches in Arizona, California, and Colorado, wearing black backpacks. At two of those churches, Salah planted those backpacks, placing congregants in fear that they contained bombs.",
      "At the other two churches, Salah was confronted by security before he got the chance to plant those backpacks. Photos of backpacks and movements from the day of the attempted attack inside the churches were included in charging documents.",
      "Dhillon said civil rights investigators have marshalled a more focused effort to combat the targeting of houses of worship.",
      "\"We want to shut that threat down by making sure that no one is feeling like churches, houses of worship, people of faith are soft targets in the United States,\" Dhillon said. \"That is why it's a priority.\"",
      "The increasing wave of threats against religious centers is \u2013 at least partly \u2013 driven by emerging white nationalism or the targeting of minority groups or churches that are welcoming to LGBTQ communities, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal-leaning nonprofit organization which focuses on civil rights issues and combating hate crimes.",
      "\"About one in 10 of the attacks that we documented in the first six months of 2024 were also focused on 'welcoming' religious communities,\" said R.G. Cravens, an SPLC researcher.",
      "\"We have seen an uptick in synagogues being targeted for similar things like vandalism, graffiti and harassment\u00a0 since the October 7th (attacks) in Israel,\" Cravens added. \"And those come in a lot of forms that often do indicate the hard right white nationalist and white supremacist groups are involved.\"",
      "Dhillon directed CBS News to several other recent cases under investigation by the Justice Department. In February, Kevin Colantonio, 36, of Rhode Island pleaded guilty to a federal criminal charge for setting multiple fires around the exterior of a predominantly black church in North Providence.",
      "The federal criminal cases yield the possibility of lengthy prison terms. Zhang's prison term runs through the year 2050.",
      "Dhillon said the Justice Department's new leadership has an urgency in tackling these cases, pointing to hate crime charges filed against a man who allegedly used Molotov cocktails to attack peaceful marchers in Boulder, Colorado, on June 1.",
      "\"We were all over it. And we filed what has been described to me as the fastest hate crime criminal complaint in recent history,\" Dhillon said. \"It is important for the community being targeted to feel and see that the United States is taking these crimes with the utmost seriousness.\"",
      "The Justice Department is preparing for an August court hearing in the case of Elias Rodriguez, who is accused of targeting and murdering two Israeli embassy officials in Washington, D.C. last month.",
      "Rodriguez allegedly shot and killed the victims \u2014 a couple about to become engaged, according to Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S. \u2014 as they were leaving the museum, which is located in the heart of the U.S. capital. According to police and video from the scene, he shouted \"free, free Palestine\" as he was being taken into custody.",
      "Within 24 hours, the Justice Department announced that the case was being investigated as a potential hate crime.\u00a0 Rodriguez is being held in pretrial detention.",

We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign.\"",

They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere.\"",
      "In his resignation letter, Ryan warned of the potential risks of resisting the administration's demands.\u00a0 \"Hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,\" Ryan wrote.",
      "His resignation came amid an investigation that targeted DEI efforts across multiple universities, with UVA's president coming under intense scrutiny from the Department of Education and Department of Justice, according to CBS News reporting.",
      "Warner acknowledged the difficult choice Ryan faced.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.\"",
      "Warner also warned that other public universities could face similar scrutiny.",
      "The DOJ is also probing the University of California system's hiring practices, investigating whether efforts to boost faculty diversity violate federal anti-discrimination laws.",
      "\"They want to take on public universities the way they have now taken on the Ivies,\" Warner said. \"This is going to hurt our universities. Chase away world-class talent. And frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?\"",
      "Most prominent among the Ivy League schools targeted by the Trump administration has been Harvard University.\u00a0 In June, the Trump administration moved to block new international students from enrolling at Harvard, accusing the university of failing to report disciplinary records and calling it \"no longer a trustworthy steward\" of international programs. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order and later extended it, describing the administration's actions as\u00a0 unconstitutional retaliation.",
      "The administration also revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, froze research funding, and pressed the university on DEI policies and campus protests. Harvard has sued, calling the actions politically motivated and a threat to academic freedom.",

      "The Hoffmans continued by saying they \"know justice will be served for both of our families\" and thanked those who attended the memorial Friday.",
      "\"We want you to know we were there with you in spirit,\" they wrote.",
      "Hortmans lie in state",
      "The funeral comes one day after the Hortmans and their dog laid in state in the Minnesota Capitol Rotunda. Melissa Hortman is the first woman to ever have the honor.",
      "Walz was among the first mourners to visit the rotunda on Friday. Later Friday afternoon, former President Joe Biden arrived at the State Capitol rotunda to pay tribute.",
      "People began arriving before 10 a.m. Friday, standing on the Capitol steps to make sure they were in place for their chance to pay tribute to the lawmaker many say perfected the art of compromise \u2014 working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what she thought was best for all Minnesotans.",
      "\"It's an honor to be here,\" said Julie Johnson, of Rochester. \"Melissa was just such a giving, selfless servant for everybody.\"",
      "Some came with flowers. Others wore their hearts on their sleeves, devastated by the loss of the people's lawmaker who worked for decades to make the lives of all Minnesotans better.",
      "Minnesota Department of Public Safety Assistant Commissioner John Cunningham said 7,500 people paid respects at the Capitol rotunda on Friday.",
      "Melissa Hortman served in the Minnesota House for 11 terms, representing District 34B, after being elected to the legislature in 2004. She also spent several years in the role of House Speaker.",
      "Melissa Hortman and her husband leave behind two children.",
      "Since her killing, many have been praising her leadership. On Thursday, U.S. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Delano, honored her on the House floor as a bridge builder.",
      "\"As speaker of the Minnesota House, she led with integrity and fostered bipartisan collaboration, even during the most challenging times in our state,\" Emmer said.",
      "Until Melissa Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "\"Melissa Hortman represented the best of Minnesota,\" DFL party chair Richard Carlbom said in a statement. \"She was a tireless, devoted public servant who deeply loved our state and devoted her life to making it a better place. The warmth and kindness she showed to her family and friends were matched only by her fierce commitment to improving the lives of those she had never even met.\"",
      "The Hortmans' suspected killer",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is accused of killing the Hortmans and their dog inside their Brooklyn Park home in the early morning hours of June 14. He was arrested near his Sibley County home some 36 hours after the shootings. Officials say it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "About 90 minutes before the Hortmans were killed, Boelter is accused of going to the Champlin home of\u00a0Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and shooting him nine times.\u00a0His wife, Yvette, was shot eight times. The Hoffmans are still recovering. The former President also paid a visit to the Hoffmans on Friday.",
      "Boelter\u00a0appeared in St. Paul's federal courthouse late Friday morning, his second court appearance since being charged by the U.S. Attorney's Office with two counts of murder, two counts of stalking and two weapons charges.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: Putting last week's dramatic military strikes aside for a moment, President Trump turns his focus to getting his Big Beautiful Bill through Congress.",
      "President Trump warned his party Saturday that refusing to support his signature domestic spending bill would be an act of the ultimate betrayal. He hit the golf course with a key GOP holdout and two of the bill's supporters. Earlier, he took aim at Democrats.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): The Democrats want to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. They have things, whether it's border or economic development or no tax on tips and Social Security and no tax on overtime.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, we will take a look at that surprising string of foreign policy successes last week with the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia's Mark Warner and Texas House Republican Michael McCaul.",
      "Then: What's next when it comes to Iran? We will talk with the head of the IAEA, the watchdog agency who monitors nuclear capabilities in Iran, Rafael Grossi, and speak to Iran's ambassador to the U.N., Amir Saeid Iravani.",
      "Finally, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb will join us for a reality check on new developments with vaccines and health policy.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Last night, the president's Big Beautiful Bill passed a key procedural vote in the Senate, but efforts to make the legislation palatable to enough Republicans to secure final passage continue, as you can see.",
      "Overnight, there are new complications. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the Senate bill would cost almost a trillion dollars more than the House bill. That's a preliminary estimate. But if the bill passes the Senate as it currently exists, that could jeopardize the fragile support among fiscal conservatives in the House.",
      "We begin today with Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. He is the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Good morning.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been probably sleep-deprived with all of what is happening.",
      "But I want to ask you about what's going on, on Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right, the no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the childcare tax credit upwards of $2,000.",
      "Why vote against it when there are popular provisions within it? And doesn't that just allow the president to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Margaret, you can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want.",
      "This will be a political albatross for the Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace.",
      "That will move us as a nation back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before Obamacare. And it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation.",
      "It also goes after food assistance. Do we \u2013 are we really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts? They even cut food banks. It's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs.",
      "And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax break. And, as you just saw on your Chyron there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this. And we will see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements, and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about, they're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So are you overstating it?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: No, it's 16 million Americans off of health care.",
      "Medicaid cuts, they're \u2013 these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what \u2013 the thing that I don't think people have realized, people say, well, I'm Medicaid, I'm not poor, I maybe buying my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month.",
      "And that will trickle through the whole rest of the health care market, because, if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care, the only way those costs get passed on is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interests, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think we will see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd rule.",
      "And it's not over until it's over. I will give you \u2013 I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of not only health care, food assistance, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner and energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion into the debt.",
      "Tell me\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 at the end of the day how that is good for America. I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the president. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia.",
      "We saw the University of Virginia's president, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity or so-called DEI programs.",
      "In a letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that, if he had tried to fight back, \"Hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld.\"",
      "But he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents, walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: This is the most outrageous action I think this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the governor.",
      "Jim Ryan had done a very good job, just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened \u2013 and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that, if he didn't resign on a day last week by 5:00, all these cuts would have taken place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was that explicit?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: It was that explicit. This is extortion.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: You're shocked that is coming \u2013 personal attacks are coming out of this administration?",
      "This is \u2013 I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about let's transfer more power to the states. This federal DOE and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university.",
      "And if they can do it here, they will do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea \u2013 and I think Jim Ryan laid it out \u2013 that he was willing to make his personal job more important than these cuts, but, boy, oh, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the university \u2013 that the administration is looking at more universities and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California next in the crosshairs. So we're going to be watching that carefully.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: They all to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities the way they have now taken on the Ivies.",
      "End of the day, this is going to hurt our universities, chase away world- class talent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on Intelligence.",
      "You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments.",
      "Let me \u2013 first of all\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission. And I think they effected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities.",
      "But the idea that the president of the United States with no data two hours after the strike is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration, that leads us to think that they are out of the game. And it \u2013 we don't know that yet.",
      "And let's just be clear. You can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create potentially \u2013 and there had been no decision made by the ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear \u2013 nuclear-armed.",
      "But what they don't know is, they didn't \u2013 and this was appropriate. I don't \u2013 I'm not criticizing administration. They didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: So, the fact that they can have still enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that means they could still move forward on something that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car.",
      "And all I don't want is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 the American people or, for that matter, our allies in the region to rely on a term that was set by the president before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb.",
      "But coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the supreme leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio on this program last Sunday told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon.",
      "So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the U.S. had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region.",
      "Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger \u2013 because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action. I think that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds and Iran doesn't strike back, hallelujah.",
      "But what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber, with this administration cutting literally half of our cybersecurity personnel in this country? So do \u2013 I just want to make sure that we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back.",
      "But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And the only way we can get resolution on that Margaret \u2013 and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief \u2013 is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: That means we have got to go to diplomacy.",
      "If America and Iran start negotiating this week face-to-face\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were \u2013 we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds potentially, the inspectors, later on in the program from the IAEA.",
      "Thank you very much, Senator.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to leave it there.",
      "We will be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Texas Republican Congressman Michael McCaul.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-Texas): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your Republican colleagues in the Senate have been working hard on trying to get this bill together, and they're probably going to eke it past.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's even with GOP lawmakers like Thom Tillis saying they can't stomach what this is going to do to Medicaid, an estimated $930 billion in cuts to it.",
      "That's more significant than what you all had voted to do in the House. Are you going to vote again for final passage if it looks like this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: No, I'm going to vote for it for this reason.",
      "I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion, $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw, with Iran, it is desperately needed.",
      "The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific. And then the tax cuts. I mean, if we don't extend these tax cuts, it'll be the largest tax increase in American history. For those three reasons, I'm a yes. I think everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean the peril they're in?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: I think, first of all, it's good for the nation.",
      "Secondly, they know that their \u2013 their jobs are at risk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president will come after them.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Not just from the president, but from the voting \u2013 the American people.",
      "Our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it about reelection, or is it about the policies, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: No. It's about \u2013 it's about what's \u2013 no, it's great for the country, and I have outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But help me understand, then. You have such narrow margins in the House.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you look at these projections from, like, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. They say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion.",
      "How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "That means that, when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think \u2013 at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do.",
      "Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months.",
      "Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect, not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA.",
      "We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets the program back a matter of years.",
      "In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their \u2013 to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real.",
      "This was a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War II.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the U.S. after the strikes.",
      "There were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: No, I have.",
      "We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you, the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2020.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: That I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list.",
      "So, you know, look \u2013 and is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know \u2013 you know, myself and others that were involved in that decision-making, and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high, 59,000 detainees, according to ICE; 47 percent of them, though, lack a criminal record. Fewer than 30 percent have been convicted of crimes.",
      "Doesn't that show that the numbers, these aren't the worst of the worst?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Yes, I was a federal prosecutor for many years, counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law.",
      "It was shall detain. He said may detain and let them out into the streets. I would \u2013 I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them, and not run up the numbers the way they are in this\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Well, I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the \u2013 under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States.",
      "And I think deterrence is the key here. And, Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border \u2013 and Texas is\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: \u2026 the biggest one \u2013 has gone down to almost zero.",
      "I mean, the border is just about secure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike McCaul, Congressman, thank you very much for your insights today.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MICHAEL MCCAUL: Thanks, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back with more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the chairman of the board at Illumina.",
      "Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP.",
      "Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And, in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"no longer a credible process\" and it's being politicized at the expense of children.",
      "That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals.",
      "The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the right to try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments.",
      "I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are \u2013 are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine.",
      "I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided who are going to find, when they go to the doctor's office, that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available.",
      "This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's unmistakable \u2013 mistakable at this point. And I think that he would probably acknowledge that, that he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines.",
      "That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people, and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's or the secretary's efforts to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal.",
      "Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's \u2013 it's journalists who are obscuring the truth.",
      "What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multidose vials of flu vaccine primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it.",
      "What it is, is an ingredient that's added to multidose vials, because those vials, you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multidose vials that \u2013 primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now.",
      "Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out, not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism.",
      "The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small \u2013 very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines. Still, 4 percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multidose vials.",
      "And this has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That \u2013 that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't \u2013 it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you.",
      "So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted advisory committee on immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor, he has oversight and chairs the Health Committee, he called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place, and when it comes to these appointees, he said, \"many of them do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology, or immunology.\" And they may have preconceived bias against mRNA vaccines.",
      "It's \u2013 I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D., (Former FBA Commissioner): Yes, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think he's quite strong and a good pick for that job.",
      "The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time.",
      "And it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So, there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So, it did show.",
      "Hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice-yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called Lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that. And given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisers get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So, this is a therapeutic. It's a long-acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So, it was a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provides sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral.",
      "We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So, it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it could be administered once ahead of flu season to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So, we're seeing a lot of innovations like this.",
      "What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in \u2013 in new companies. And there has been a pullback of biotech start-ups that have been looking to develop new vaccines. For example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr virus, which we know is linked to certain \"b\"-cell lymphomas and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That \u2013 that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future we may be vaccinating for EBV. But there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. And so I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves in that direction. He said, \"You're going to see probably slightly more cavities, but there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.\" What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long-standing issue. Another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived \u2013 this perception that there's a link between fluoride in water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water. And at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe.",
      "The CDC has data showing that there's a 25 percent reduction in dental caries (ph) as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Dr. Gottlieb, good to get your insight today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even the Iranians concede that the damage to three of their nuclear sites from last week's bombing was excessive and serious, but it's a mystery as to what the Iranian nuclear capability is now. Friday, we spoke with the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, Rafael Mariano Grossi, and we asked him just that.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI (IAEA Director General): It's clear that what happened in particular in \u2013 in Fordow, in Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has to some degree capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion, and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So, there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those \u2013 of those capabilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium before the attacks.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's \u2013 it's logical to presume, that when they announced that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So, some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved.",
      "So, there has to be, at some point, a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as \u2013 as a potential problem. So, this is why I say, it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is, and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is there still a risk that they could rushing towards a bomb?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: We don't want to be alarmists here. And I don't want to \u2013 to \u2013 to be part of a, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to assert and to confirm what is there and \u2013 and where is it and \u2013 and \u2013 and what happened.",
      "Iran had a very vast, ambitious program. Part of it may still be there. And if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So, you cannot dis-invent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So, I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations are not \u2013 you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Up until these strikes, Iran \u2013 Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA in certain amounts.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Well, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Well, there \u2013 there were \u2013 there were deficits. There were deficits. There were some things that they were not clarifying to us. But our inspection work was \u2013 was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was \u2013 it was complete. It was comprehensive. And \u2013 and, of course, at the moment, there is \u2013 there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested that they were looking to weaponize?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: They have all of these capabilities, but for the agency they \u2013 first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons, OK? This needs to be said. The IAEA does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So, it is countries that \u2013 that say, well, this is of concern on a (ph).",
      "What we were concerning \u2013 what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we have found traces of uranium in \u2013 in \u2013 in some places in Iran which were not the normal, declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place \"x,\" \"y,\" or zed (ph). And we were simply not getting credible answers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: There was material. Where is this material? So, there could be even more. We \u2013 we \u2013 we don't know. This is why we need to go back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that report that you gave about some of those open questions or unanswered questions.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Iranians are pointing to it now. And the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said, it wasn't honest and fair, your report. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that they \u2013 that we're seeing (ph) in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't because this was not what we were seeing, all right, so \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to say everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months. But once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the national intelligence director say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years.",
      "What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium. Or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there. It is clear that there have been severe damage, but is not total damage, first of all.",
      "And secondly, Iran has the capacities there. Industrial and technological capacities. So, if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can watch our full interview with Director Grossi on our website or YouTube channel, or listen on our FACE THE NATION podcast platform.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, can you give us some clarity. Does Iran intend to reconstitute a nuclear enrichment program on its soil?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: You know that we are a member \u2013 responsible member of the NPT. And according to the \u2013 this treaty, we have the mutual rights. It means that the right of one side will be the obligation of the other sides. And the NPT has been defined that we have to the (ph) exclusive rights.",
      "The first is that we can have research on development, we can have the production of uranium, and we can have \u2013 use the peaceful energy. And the second right is that the legal protection by the IAEA for our activity and technical corporations for our development programs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: And, in return, also, it will be to right for the agency in this regard that they should have the full access, according to the safeguard cohesive (ph) \u2013safeguard agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: And the second one is that to preserve our peaceful nuclear activity will remain always in peaceful manner. So, the enrichment is our right. An inalienable right. And we want to implement this right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you do plan to restart enrichment that sounds like.",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: I think that enrichment will not \u2013 never stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you mention NPT, just for our listeners, you're talking about some of the international agreements Iran has made with the U.N., on non-proliferation and safeguards. You mentioned the U.N. nuclear inspectors.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement yesterday saying that there were calls in Iran \u2013 this, I believe, is from a newspaper that the supreme leader oversees, accusing our prior guest, Raphael Grossi, of being an Israeli spy and calling for his arrest and execution. To be clear, is Iran threatening U.N. inspectors?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: No, there is not any threat. It is a very clear law of our parliament that they have suspended our cooperation with IAEA because the agency has not implemented their rights, their responsibility. Due to this, it is conditional law. And as long as this condition has not been set, so are the cooperation with IAEA will be suspended.",
      "But wherever it's set up as according to the law, so we can have \u2013 resume our cooperation. But there is not any threat against the general director of IAEA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was published in Israel \u2013 in Iran's Kayhan newspaper. Your foreign minister did also say that the IAEA and Grossi himself are malign in intent. Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe and can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: Exactly. They are in Iran. They are in the safe conditions. But activity has been suspended. They cannot have access to our site. But maybe some one individual opinion of the people that may criticize the IAEA or threat the general director. But we criticize IAEA. We \u2013 our assessment is that they have not done their jobs, so they failed and they prepared and pay great (ph) for such aggravation against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine that you would condemn the calls for his execution?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's \u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and I know, and you're speaking to us from the U.N.",
      "President Trump said Friday that Iranian officials want to meet with him, personally, and he said that will be soon. Mr. Ambassador, is Tehran planning to drop this demand of indirect communication with the United States, and will you be begin speaking with the Trump administration?",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: See we're willing (ph) the negotiation, but because we know that any dispute between Iran and the United States or other part of the JCPOA cannot be resolved without negotiation and using the peaceful means for \u2013 to resolve this dispute. So, we are in the negotiation, we are ready for the negotiation. But after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation. And there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the United States is wanting to meet with Iran to talk. And while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: Oh, it is a very gross violation of international law that they're treating the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran or any heads of our state. They have impunity from any attacks. So, we should understand that what is the principle and condition for any negotiation. Negotiation is \u2013 has its \u2013 the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with this order (ph) maybe we reach to a conclusion or not. But unconditional surrender is not negotiation \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMIR SAEID IRAVANI: \u2013 it is dictating the policy towards us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that. But if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them.",

Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe? And can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Exactly. They are in Iran. They are in the safe condition, but the activity has been suspended. They cannot have accesses to our site, but maybe some one, it is individual, opinion of the people that may criticize the IAEA or threat the general director. But we criticize IAEA. We- our assessment is that they have not done their jobs, so they failed and they prepared [inaudible] for such aggression against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine that you would condemn the calls for his execution?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's--",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: (INAUDIBLE) --media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, and you're speaking to us from the UN. President Trump said Friday that Iranian officials want to meet with him personally, and he said that will be soon. Mr. Ambassador, is Tehran planning to drop this demand of indirect communication with the United States, and will you begin speaking with the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: See you, we were in the negotiation, but because we know that any dispute between Iran and United States or other parts of the JCPOA cannot be resolved without the negotiation and using the peaceful means for- to resolve this dispute. So we are in the negotiation, and we are ready for the negotiation, but after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation, and there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the United States is wanting to meet with Iran to talk, and while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: It is very gross violation of the international law that- threatening the Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic of Iran or any head of state, they have impunity from any attack. So we should understand that, what is the principle and condition for any negotiation? Negotiation is- has its- the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with each other, maybe we reach to a conclusion or not, but the unconditional surrender is not negotiation. It is dictating the policy toward us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that, but if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your time today. We will be watching and waiting to see if there are any diplomatic opportunities. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Pfizer board member and non-executive chairman of the board at Illumina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the Chairman of the Board at Illumina. Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is, quote, 'no longer a credible process' and it's being politicized at the expense of children. That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals. The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the Right to Try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments. I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are- are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine. I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided, who are going to find when they go to the doctor's office that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available. This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's mistakable at this point. I think that he would probably acknowledge that. That he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines. That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's, or the secretary's efforts, to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal. Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's- it's journalists who are obscuring the truth. What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine, primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it. What it is is an ingredient that's added to multi-dose vials because those vials you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multi-dose vials that primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now. Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out. Not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism. The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small- very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines, still four percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multi-dose vials. This has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism. That- that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't- it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you. So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted Advisory Committee on Immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor. He has oversight and chairs the Health Committee. He called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place. And when it comes to these appointees, he said many of them 'do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology' and they may have 'preconceived bias' against mRNA vaccines. It's- I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy, at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think she's quite strong and a good pick for that job. The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership, it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience, or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time, and it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So it did show, hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that, and given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisors get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So this is a therapeutic. It's a long acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So it's a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provide sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral. We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with, that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it- it could be administered once ahead of flu season, to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So we're seeing a lot of innovations like this. What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in- in new companies, and there has been a pullback of biotech startups that have been looking to develop new vaccines, for example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr Virus, which we know is linked to certain B-cell lymphomas, and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That- that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future, we may be vaccinating for EBV, but there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. So I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves that direction. He said you're going to see 'probably slightly more cavities,' but 'there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.' What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long standing issue, another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived- perception that there's a link between fluoride and water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water, and at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe. CDC's- has data showing that there's a 25% reduction in dental caries as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",

      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your Republican colleagues in the Senate have been working hard on trying to get this bill together, and they're probably going to eek it past.",
      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's even with GOP lawmakers like Thom Tillis saying they can't stomach what this is going to do to Medicaid, an estimated $930 billion in cuts to it. That's more significant than what you all had voted to do in the House. Are you going to vote again for final passage if it looks like this?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I'm going to vote for it for this reason. I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion,\u00a0 $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw with Iran, is desperately needed. The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific. And then the tax cuts. I mean, if we don't extend these tax cuts, it'll be the largest tax increase in American history for those three reasons. I'm a yes. I think everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean the peril they're in?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think, first of all, it's good for the nation. Secondly, they know that their-their jobs are at risk. Not just from the president, but from the voting- the American people. Our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it about reelection, or is it about the policies, right?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No-no. It's about- it's about- it's great for the country, and I've outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to help me understand then- you have such narrow margins in the house, and you look at these projections from like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion. How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office. That means that when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I think at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do. Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there, at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months. Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA. We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets a program back a matter of years. In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their- to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically, is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real. This is a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War Two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the US. After the strikes, there were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I have. We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one, a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: -- back in 2020--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list. So, you know, look- is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States, that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know- you know- myself and others that were involved in that decision making and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high 59,000 detainees, according to ICE. 47% of them, though, lack a criminal record, fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes. Doesn't that show that the numbers- these aren't the worst of the worst.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Yeah, I was a federal prosecutor for many years. Counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that my Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law. It was shall detain. He said, may detain and let them out into the streets. I would, I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them and not run up the numbers the way they are in this--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the- under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States. And I think deterrence is the key here. And Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border, and Texas is the biggest one, has gone down to almost zero. I mean, the border is just about secure, catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, said Sunday that President Trump's tax bill that's nearing a final vote in the Senate will be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, citing the cuts to social safety nets and its projected effect on the national debt.",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Senate is working through the weekend as the GOP makes a push to pass the legislation, known as the \"big, beautiful bill,\" ahead of a July 4 deadline to get the bill to the president's desk. The House narrowly approved the bill last month, but the Senate has been putting its imprint on the massive package that extends Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts and would fund border security, defense and energy production priorities, costs which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation  would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "In addition to the increase to the national debt, Warner criticized the bill for the toll he warned it would take on rural hospitals, access to health insurance, food assistance and clean energy jobs.",
      "The Senate is expected to begin a marathon overnight session Sunday as the bill nears final passage. It would then return to the House for signoff on the upper chamber's changes, before it can go to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "Senate Republicans are working to pass the legislation under the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. The process means Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill, which they largely oppose, apart from delaying a vote. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer forced the bill to be read on the floor in its entirety late Saturday, which has pushed back debate on the bill by more than 12 hours.",
      "When asked why Democrats are expected to widely oppose the bill when there are provisions within it that they may see as favorable, such as an expansion of the Child Tax Credit and a provision limiting taxes on tips, Warner said \"you can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want.\"",
      "The Virginia Democrat suggested that the bill could even lose support from Republicans, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\" He added that while Mr. Trump \"has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner,\" the bill \"will come back and bite them.\"",
      "All but two Republicans voted to advance the measure Saturday in a key test vote. But the GOP win came after hours of hand-wringing over whether a handful of Republicans would prevent the legislation from moving forward. The vote remained open for more than three hours Saturday night as holdouts met with Senate GOP leaders to seek assurances on the bill. And Vice President JD Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. He joined a meeting with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday night.",
      "Vance's presence at the Capitol came as the White House put pressure on Republicans in Congress to get the legislation to the president's desk. In a Truth Social post Saturday night, Mr. Trump indicated he would work to support primary challenges to one of the bill's opponents, GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who is up for reelection in 2026.",
      "GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said Republicans in the House \"know their jobs are at risk\" if they oppose the measure, citing pressure from the president and the American people themselves. He said \"our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.\"",
      "\"Everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing,\" McCaul said.",
      "The Texas Republicans said he plans to support the measure when it returns to the House due to its funding for border security and defense, along with the tax cut extensions. And he predicted that it will see support even among fiscal hawks who have expressed opposition to the legislation.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it,\" McCaul said.",

      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been, probably, sleep-deprived with all of what is happening, but I want to ask you about what's going on in Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But, it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right? The no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the Child Care Tax Credit upwards of $2,000. Why vote against it, when there are popular provisions within it, and doesn't that just allow the President to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: \u00a0-- because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid, and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace. That will move us, as a nation, back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before- before Obamacare. And, it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation. It also goes after food assistance. So we are really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts. They even cut food banks. It's- it's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs. And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax-break. And, as you just saw on your chyron, there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",

They're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So, are you overstating it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. It's 16 million Americans off of health care. You know, Medicaid cuts- these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what- the thing that I don't think people have realized is people say, well, Medicaid, I'm not poor. I, maybe, buy my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month. And that will trickle through the whole rest of the healthcare market, because if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care. The only way those costs get passed on, is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interest, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I think we'll see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd Rule. It's not over until it's over. I will give you- I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of, not only health care, food assistance, you know, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion to the debt.\u00a0Tell me, at the end of the day, how that is good for America? I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the President. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia. We saw the University of Virginia's President, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity, or so-called DEI programs. In the letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that if he had tried to fight back, hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld. But, he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents: walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened, and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that if he didn't resign on a day last week, by five o'clock, all these cuts would take place. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It was that explicit? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- It was that explicit. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is- but that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes. Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You're shocked it's coming- personal attacks are coming out of this administration? This is, you know- I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about, let's transfer more power in the States. This federal D.O.E. and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal- personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the universe that the administration is looking at more universities, and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California is next to the crosshairs, so we're going to be watching that carefully --",
      "SEN. WARNER: They all want to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities, the way they have now taken on the Ivys. End of the day, this is going to hurt our\u00a0universities, chase away what world-class talent. And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on intelligence. You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments. Let me- first of all, we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission, and I think they affected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities. But, the idea that the President of the United States, with no data, two hours after the strike, is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration. That leads us to think that they are out of the game, and we don't know that yet. And, let's just be clear, you can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create, potentially, and there'd been no decision made by the Ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear warned. But what they don't know is they didn't, and this was appropriate, I'm not criticizing the administration; they didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- So, the fact that they can have, still, enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that- means they could\u00a0still move forward on something, that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car. And all I don't want is the American people, or, for that matter, our allies in the region, to rely on a term that was set by the President before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb. But, coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the Supreme Leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio, on this program, last Sunday, told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon. So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the US had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SEN. WARNER:\u00a0 We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war, in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region. Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger? Because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action, I think that's- that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds, and Iran doesn't strike back, Hallelujah. But, what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber with this administration cutting, literally, half of our cyber-security personnel in this country? So, I just want to make sure that we- we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back. But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities. And the only way we can get resolution on that, Margaret, and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief, is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors. That means we've got to go to diplomacy. If America and Iran start negotiating this week, face-to-face, that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were- we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds, potentially, the inspectors later on in the program from the IAEA. Thank you very much, Senator. We're going to have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Mr. Trump took office in January, attempts to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed, faltering over one major sticking point: whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.",

      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry on Sunday said an additional 88 people were killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the death toll to 56,500 in over 20 months of fighting. The ministry does not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza. Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.",

      "The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, whose birthday is also Saturday, later posted that the bill would be \"political suicide for the Republican Party.\"",

      "Musk has previously made his opinions about Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" clear. In late May, just a few days before he officially left his post in the federal government, he told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" with the bill's price tag.",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told CBS News.",

      "Following a laudatory celebration in the Oval Office, his language became more aggressive and he blasted the bill as \"pork-filled\" and a \"disgusting abomination.\"",
      "\"Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it,\" he wrote on X earlier this month. In another post, the wealthy GOP donor who had recently forecasted that he'd step back from political donations threatened to fire lawmakers who \"betrayed the American people.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump clapped back to say he was disappointed with Musk, back-and-forth fighting erupted and quickly escalated. Musk suggested without evidence that Mr. Trump, who spent the first part of the year as one of his closest allies, was mentioned in files related to sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The president also threatened to cut off federal subsidies and contracts to Elon Musk's companies. SpaceX receives tens of billions of dollars in federal money, most of which are in the form of federal grants from NASA.",

      "Musk ultimately tried to make nice with the administration, saying he regretted some of his posts that \"went too far.\" Trump responded in kind in an interview with The New York Post, saying, \"Things like that happen. I don't blame him for anything.\"",

The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-city-ruled-by-females-catalhoyuk/",
    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:26:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "Scientists have identified what could be the oldest rocks on Earth from a rock formation in Canada.",
      "The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt has long been known for its ancient rocks - plains of streaked gray stone on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Quebec. But researchers disagree on exactly how old they are.",
      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",
      "\"There's a lot of interest for these rocks, which we understand,\" said Palliser, a member of the community. \"We just don't want any more damage.\"",

      "Liftoff came eight days later than originally planned due to high winds in the West Texas desert, but the weather met Blue Origin's safety requirements on Sunday.",
      "The hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine powering the New Shepard fired for about two-and-a-half minutes, accelerating the spacecraft to just under three times the speed of sound. The capsule then separated from the booster and continued coasting upward along its up-and-down trajectory.",
      "At that point, the passengers \u2013 Allie and Carl Kuehner, Leland Larson, Freddie Rescigno Jr., Jim Sitkin and Owolabi Salis, the first Nigerian to fly in space \u2013 began enjoying about three minutes of weightlessness.",
      "Free to unstrap and float about the cabin, the passengers were able to take in the view through the largest windows in any operational spacecraft as the ship climbed to an altitude of just above 65 miles. That's about three miles higher than the internationally recognized boundary between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The capsule then began falling back to Earth and the passengers returned to their seats for the descent to touchdown. The reusable booster, meanwhile, made its own return to the launch site, dropping tail first to a rocket-powered touchdown.",
      "Floating under three red-and-blue parachutes, the New Shepard capsule touched down a stone's throw from the booster's concrete landing pad, closer than any previous landing. Blue Origin said that it was the result of \"low winds ... and within the safety margins of our predicted models.\"",
      "Blue Origin has now launched 13 passenger flights since the sub-orbital spacecraft carried Amazon and Blue Origin founder Bezos and three others aloft in July 2021. The company has now launched 74 passengers, including Bezos' wife Lauren S\u00e1nchez, and four who have flown twice.",

      "Retired astronaut\u00a0Peggy Whitson, America's most experienced space flier, and three rookie crewmates from India, Poland and Hungary blasted off on a\u00a0privately-financed flight\u00a0to the International Space Station early Wednesday - the fourth non-government mission mounted by Houston-based Axiom Space.",
      "Strapped into a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, Whitson, test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu roared away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at  2:31 a.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 first stage propelled the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere along a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast of the United States.",
      "The booster then fell away and flew itself back to a pinpoint landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to close out its second flight, SpaceX's 467th successful recovery and its 64th in Florida.",
      "The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA trips to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit.",
      "The climb to orbit went smoothly, and the capsule was released to fly on its own about nine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. Whitson then revealed the name of the new spacecraft: Crew Dragon Grace.",
      "\"We  had an incredible ride uphill, and now we'd like to set our course for  the International Space Station aboard the newest member of the Dragon  fleet, our spacecraft named Grace. ... Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",
      "The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three private astronaut missions.",
      "Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab.",
      "\"We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,\" Whitson said. \"The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station.",
      "\"Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well.\"",
      "All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission \"opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.\"",

    "summary": "Anthropic didn't violate U.S. copyright law when the AI company used millions of legally purchased books to train its chatbot, judge rules.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",
      "Meta also won a major victory this week after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the methods the company used to train its artificial intelligence technology. The case was brought by a group of well-known authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman and writer Jacqueline Woodson, who alleged Meta was \"liable for massive copyright infringement\" when it used copies of their books to train Meta's generative AI system Llama.",

Norris said a signal was detected coming from a cellphone that was in the same spot since about 3:16 p.m. local time and authorities honed in on it.",
      "The body and firearm were quickly removed from the scene because the fire was rapidly approaching, he said. Gunfire had been exchanged with the suspect and it was unclear whether he'd shot himself. At one point, authorities had two helicopters overhead with snipers in them.",
      "The suspect in the Idaho shooting has been identified as Wess Roley, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A shelter-in-place order for area residents was lifted but residents were urged to stay alert because the fire was still burning.",

      "Norris didn't say what type of rifle was found or what investigators think the gunman's motive might have been.",
      "He said the blaze covered about 20 acres and there were 300 law enforcement officers at the scene including some from Spokane, Washington, and the FBI.",
      "Sheriff's officials said crews responded to a blaze on Canfield Mountain just north of Coeur d'Alene around 1:30 p.m. and gunshots were reported about a half hour later. The gunfire continued over several hours.",

      "Judge Arun Subramanian began reading instructions on the law on Monday morning to the jury of eight men and four women. Now, they'll sift through seven weeks of sometimes graphic and emotional testimony about the rap, fashion and reality TV impresario's propensity for violence and his sexual predilections, including drug-fueled sex marathons dubbed \"freak-offs\" or \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking \u2014 relating to two of his ex-girlfriends \u2014 and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution for allegedly arranging to fly sex workers across state lines.",
      "CBS News legal contributor Caroline Polisi, a criminal defense attorney, said the prosecution's best chance at getting a conviction could be with the sex trafficking charges.",

Remember, he videotaped all of these encounters, and the government laid out specific instances where he threatened to release those tapes.\"",
      "In closing arguments last week, federal prosecutors and Combs' defense team took their last shots at convincing jurors to convict or acquit the Grammy Award-winning founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law.\"",

      "\"He is not a racketeer. He is not a conspirator to commit racketeering. He is none of these things. He is innocent. He sits there innocent. Return him to his family, who have been waiting for him,\" the lawyer told jurors.",
      "In all, 34 witnesses testified, headlined by Combs' former girlfriends Cassie \u2014 the R&B singer born Casandra Ventura \u2014 and \"Jane,\" who testified under a pseudonym. Both women said he often was violent toward them. Cassie said he forced her into hundreds of sexual encounters with paid male sex workers while Jane recounted numerous \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Jurors also saw now-infamous security camera video of Combs beating, kicking and dragging Cassie at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 and clips from videos of sexual encounters.",
      "Combs chose not to testify, and his lawyers didn't call any witnesses in their defense case. His attorneys elected instead to challenge the accusers' credibility during lengthy cross-examination questioning.",
      "The defense has acknowledged that Combs veered into violence, but his lawyers maintain that the sex acts were consensual. They contend that prosecutors are intruding in Combs' personal life and that he's done nothing to warrant the charges against him.",

      "Since launching in 2017, Luckin has scaled rapidly to over 24,000 stores, with locations in China, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, according to a recent financial report. Despite hiccups, including an accounting fraud scandal, and $475 million in losses last year as the company poured hundreds of millions of dollars into coffee beans, store rent and other costs, Luckin's profit margins have rapidly ballooned. This past quarter, the coffee chain made $1.2 million in revenue, a 41% increase from the year prior.",
      "The store's app-based concept, contrived by founder Jenny Zhiya Qian, was intended to echo that of a ride-hailing business, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",

This is a \"100% cashier-less environment,\" Luckin states\u00a0on its website, adding that the app-based store model is intended to maximize efficiency and keep costs low. The company's beverages in China are 30% cheaper than Starbucks beverages in the country, according to CNN.",
      "Luckin's menu offers a range of drinks from traditional items like matcha and lattes to more unconventional choices like its \"fruity Americano\" series. It also has a small pastry menu including a banana yogurt loaf,\u00a0 chocolate-chip cookie and a sausage, egg and cheese croissant, among other offerings.",

      "With more than 17,000\u00a0locations across the country, Starbucks has the upper hand in the U.S. In China, however, the Seattle-based coffee giant lost its hold to Luckin in 2023, the Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "Significantly cheaper menu items and a convenient in-app ordering model boded well for Luckin in China, though it remains to be seen if the same exact strategy will be applied in the U.S. market.",
      "A quick glance at Luckin's in-app menu shows that prices on key items are more or less on par with those at U.S. Starbucks stores. A 16-ounce drip coffee at Luckin, for instance, goes for $3.45 compared with $3.65 at Starbucks. A 16-ounce iced matcha, meanwhile, costs $6.45 at Luckin, or 20 cents more than the $6.25 equivalent at Starbucks. A bagel at both companies goes for $3.25.",

      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month.",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster had called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement,\" The Associated Press reported last week. She also said that remaining data sources \"are fully capable of providing a complete set of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "NOAA is facing this imminent data cutoff after losing a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration said a failure by the university to enact certain changes would put at risk its access to federal financial resources.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration informed Harvard University on Monday that it found the elite school violated federal civil rights law through its treatment of Jewish and Israeli students on campus and warned that a failure by the university to enact certain changes \"immediately\" would put at risk its federal financial resources.",
      "Top Trump administration officials at the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as the General Services Administration, notified Harvard of the findings of an investigation into alleged antisemitism at the school and concluded that it is in \"violent violation\" of a provision of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs that receive federal assistance.",
      "\"Harvard's commitment to racial hierarchies \u2014 where individuals are sorted and judged according to their membership in an oppressed group identity and not individual merit \u2014 has enabled anti-Semitism to fester on Harvard's campus and has led a once great institution to humiliation, offering remedial math and forcing Jewish students to hide their identities and ancestral stories,\" the administration officials, which make up the Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, wrote.",
      "They warned that a failure to \"institute adequate changes immediately\" would lead to a loss of federal financial resources to Harvard and \"continue to affect\" the university's relationship with the federal government.",
      "Harvard said in response to the investigation's conclusion that it has made \"significant strides to combat bigotry, hate and bias\" and is committed to \"ensuring members of our Jewish and Israeli community are embraced, respected, and can thrive at Harvard.\"",
      "\"Antisemitism is a serious problem and no matter the context, it is unacceptable. Harvard has taken substantive, proactive steps to address the root causes of antisemitism in its community,\" the university said in a statement. \"In responding to the government's investigation, Harvard not only shared its comprehensive and retrospective Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias Report but also outlined the ways that it has strengthened policies, disciplined those who violate them, encouraged civil discourse, and promoted open, respectful dialogue. Harvard is far from indifferent on this issue and strongly disagrees with the government's findings.\"",
      "The Trump administration has been engaged in an ongoing battle with Harvard and mounted efforts to punish the school on multiple fronts. Agencies have frozen billions of dollars in grants and contracts to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based university and revoked its ability to enroll foreign students. Harvard has sued the administration over its efforts, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the moves related to international students. President Trump has also threatened to revoke\u00a0Harvard's tax-exempt status, and the university is facing numerous investigations from across the federal government.",
      "Many of the sanctions stem from what administration officials have said is the school's failure to condemn antisemitism and protect Jewish students on campus. But the Trump administration has also taken aim at Harvard's hiring and admissions practices, and in April, it made a series of 10 demands in a letter to university leadership. Among the changes government officials said Harvard needs to undertake are a discontinuation of its diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and policies; implementation of merit-based admissions and hiring policies; and disclosure of all foreign funding sources.",
      "Harvard bucked the administration's demands, which its president, Alan Garber, said exceed the power of the federal government.",
      "In its latest letter to Garber related to the civil rights investigation, led by the Office for Civil Rights at the United States Department of Health and Human Services, federal officials accused Harvard of \"being among the most prominent and visible breeding ground for race discrimination.\" They cited the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that ended affirmative action programs in higher education, which arose from a challenge to Harvard's policies.",
      "\"Any institution that refuses to meet its duties under federal law may not receive a wide range of federal privileges,\" they said.",
      "The letter is signed by Harmeet Dhillon, assistant attorney general for civil rights; Sean Keveney, acting general counsel of the Department of Health and Human Services; Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner for Federal Acquisition Service at the General Services Administration; and Thomas Wheeler, acting general counsel at the Department of Education.",
      "The officials said its investigation found that a quarter of Jewish students felt physically unsafe on the Ivy League campus, and Jewish and Israeli students were assaulted and spit on. They also cited a pro-Palestinian encampment set up on Harvard Yard last year that \"instilled fear in, and disrupted the studies of, Jewish and Israeli students.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it found that \"Harvard has been in some cases deliberately indifferent, and in others has been a willful participant in anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students, faculty, and staff.\"",
      "Amid the ongoing fight with Harvard, Mr. Trump\u00a0hinted earlier this month that his administration had been in talks with the university, writing on social media that it was \"very possible that a Deal will be announced over the next week or so.\"",
      "\"They have acted extremely appropriately during these negotiations, and appear to be committed to doing what is right,\" the president wrote. \"If a Settlement is made on the basis that is currently being discussed, it will be 'mindbogglingly' HISTORIC, and very good for our Country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not provide any further details about the possible settlement or what it would resolve.",

    "summary": "After debate on President Trump's massive tax bill stretched into early Monday, the Senate kicked off what's expected to be a marathon vote series on the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate kicked off a \"vote-a-rama\" on President Trump's massive tax bill Monday, beginning what's expected to be a marathon session after the chamber debated the bill into the wee hours of the morning as Republicans work to pass the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda.",
      "The House narrowly passed the bill last month, and Senate Republicans have been working to put their mark on the legislation, treading carefully so as not to throw off the delicate balance in the lower chamber. The House will need to approve the Senate's changes to the bill before it can head to the president's desk for his signature. And lawmakers are trying to move quickly, with a self-imposed July 4 deadline to get the measure signed.",
      "The Senate worked through the weekend as the GOP nears a final sprint on the legislation ahead of the deadline. Titled \"One Big, Beautiful Bill,\" the legislation includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which is offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimated Sunday that the legislation would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Republicans advanced the legislation\u00a0late Saturday, with all but two voting in favor following hours of delay as the GOP worked to iron out last-minute details and dispel concern among holdouts. The vote on the motion to proceed stayed open for more than three hours as holdouts sought assurances from GOP leaders. Some tweaks were made to the bill before Republicans ultimately received enough votes to move forward.",
      "Senate Democrats further delayed the legislation's path forward by forcing the bill to be read in its entirety, starting late Saturday. After nearly 16 hours, the Senate clerks concluded their reading of the bill on the floor, starting the clock on debate. Each side then had up to 10 hours for debate.",
      "The \"vote-a-rama\"",
      "Following debate, and a break until the morning, the Senate is beginning what's known as a \"vote-a-rama,\" in which senators may offer an unlimited number of amendments and force the chamber to cast vote after vote. Democrats are expected to use the opportunity to put their GOP colleagues on the record on a number of controversial issues ahead of the midterm elections.",
      "But before the chamber could get to the amendment votes, senators had to address an outstanding disagreement over the current policy baseline, an accounting approach that would make it appear that extending the current tax policy would cost nothing. Senate Majority Leader John Thune maneuvered Sunday to allow the use of the current policy baseline, before Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly appealed the move, requesting a vote as Democrats railed against it as the \"nuclear option.\" The chamber voted 53-47, along party lines, to affirm the use of the current policy baseline on Monday.",
      "Schumer said that Democrats would bring \"one amendment after the other\" Monday, and began the process by offering an amendment to send the bill back to the Finance Committee to revisit some of its health care provisions. The chamber voted down the amendment in a party-line vote.",
      "The path to passage",
      "Senate Republicans have been pursuing the legislation through the budget reconciliation process, which enables the party in the majority to move ahead without support from across the aisle. With only a simple majority required to advance the measure, rather than the 60-votes needed to move forward with most legislation, Senate Democrats have few mechanisms to combat the bill's progress.",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose support from three Republicans \u2014 and would then still require a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance. And although a number of senators who had expressed opposition to the measure ultimately decided to advance it Saturday, how they will vote on the measure in a final form remains unclear.",
      "Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Thom Tillis of North Carolina were the two Republicans to oppose the bill's advancement Saturday, and are expected to oppose the legislation on final passage. Tillis, who announced Sunday that he is not seeking reelection, took to the Senate floor that night to outline his opposition to some of the bill's cuts to Medicaid, claiming \"Republicans are about to make a mistake on health care\" and arguing that the GOP is \"betraying our promise.\"",
      "\"It is inescapable that this bill in its current form will betray the very promise that Donald J. Trump made\" to target only waste, fraud and abuse in the entitlement program, Tillis said, claiming that the president has been \"misinformed\"",
      "The North Carolina Republican argued that the July 4 deadline is an \"artificial\" one, saying Senate Republicans are rushing, while encouraging the chamber to \"take the time to get this right\" and align more closely with the House's Medicaid provisions.",
      "But Senate GOP leaders are still moving ahead. Thune, a South Dakota Republican, delivered a defense of the bill on the Senate floor ahead of the vote-a-rama Monday, pushing back on criticism over Medicaid cuts, the impact on the deficit and the use of the current policy baseline.",
      "\"Let's vote,\" Thune said. \"This is good for America.\"",
      "When asked whether he's confident Senate Republicans have the votes to pass the legislation, the majority leader told reporters, \"Never, until we vote.\"",
      "Vance was on hand to break a possible tie vote Saturday, though his vote ultimately wasn't needed. Still, the vice president met with GOP holdouts in the majority leader's office Saturday as the White House put pressure on lawmakers to get the bill across the finish line. And his vote may be needed to get the legislation across the finish line.",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, warned Sunday that the legislation would be a \"political albatross\" for Republicans, while suggesting that the bill could even lose support among the GOP, saying \"it's not over until it's over.\"",
      "\"I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their conviction,\" Warner said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of workers across more than a dozen cities and states will soon receive higher pay, thanks to minimum wage hikes set to take effect July 1.",
      "More than 800,000 workers in two states \u2014Alaska and Oregon \u2014 as well as Washington, D.C., will be impacted by higher minimum wages that go into effect July 1, according to the left-leaning economic think tank Economic Policy Institute (EPI). Additionally, a dozen cities and counties are also set to boost their baseline pay rates next month.",
      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009. As the cost of living has crept higher in subsequent years, some states and municipalities have boosted their own minimum wages through a combination of ballot measures, inflation adjustments and legislation.",
      "\"These minimum wage increases will put more money in workers' pockets, helping many of them and their families make ends meet,\" EPI state economic analyst Sebastian Martinez Hickey wrote in a post about the higher pay. \"The average increase in annual wages for a full-time, year-round worker resulting from these minimum wage hikes ranges from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.\"",
      "About 58% of the workers who will receive pay hikes are women, while Black and Hispanic workers will also disproportionately benefit, according to the EPI's analysis.",
      "For example, in states where the minimum wage will increase in July, Black workers make up 7% of workers who will receive raises, but only 4.5% of the wage-earning workforce. Similarly, nearly 27% of Hispanic workers will see their wages rise, though they make up just over 13% of the wage-earning workforce.",
      "While the federal minimum wage hasn't budged in 16 years, there have been periodic attempts to boost it, with the latest coming from Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, who earlier this month introduced legislation to increase the national baseline wage to $15 per hour. He was joined by Vermont Democratic Sen. Peter Welch as a co-sponsor.",
      "Pay hikes in Alaska, D.C., and Oregon",
      "Alaska's baseline wage will rise by $1.09 to $13.00 an hour, which was approved via a ballot measure passed by voters. The boost will impact 6.3% of the state's workforce, or 19,400 people, who will see an average annual pay increase of $925, EPI calculates.",
      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula. With the new minimum in place, a full-time worker in the nation's capital will earn an additional $727 in annual wages, on average, according to the EPI's calculations.",
      "Oregon's minimum wage will rise 35 cents to $15.05 an hour on July 1, also through an inflation adjustment, boosting pay for 9.4% of the state's workforce, or 801,700 workers. The average pay hike will equate to $420 annually.",

      "\"The demand for women's basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \"This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league's extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women's professional basketball.\"",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\"This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \"Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights.

      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",

      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",

You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates.

    "summary": "Republicans released an updated version of the legislation late Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans released the latest version of President Trump's massive spending and tax bill late Friday as the GOP eyes an ambitious July 4 deadline to approve the centerpiece legislation of the president's second-term agenda.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate Republicans have been putting their imprint on the bill. But GOP leaders are seeking a middle ground to appease the upper chamber without alienating House Republicans, who will have to approve the Senate's changes before the bill can head to the president's desk for his signature.",
      "The Senate voted Saturday to advance the measure, overcoming a key hurdle as the upper chamber works toward final passage, and will vote on amendments and then the overall bill on Monday.",
      "At the center of the bill is an extension to Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, slated to sunset at year's end, seeking to make the cuts permanent in what has been a key priority for Senate Republicans. It also includes increased spending for border security, defense and energy production, which are offset in part by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs.",
      "But along with different dynamics in the Senate, Republicans have also been contending with input from the Senate's rulekeeper, known as the parliamentarian. She has been weighing in on the bill's components to determine whether they may fly under the reconciliation process, which allows the GOP to move forward with the bill without any support from across the aisle.",
      "Here's what's in the Senate's updated version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" some of which remains in flux:",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes restrictions on Medicaid, which provides government-sponsored health care for low-income and disabled Americans. Like the House-passed bill, the legislation imposes work requirements for some able-bodied adults and more frequent eligibility checks. But the Senate parliamentarian determined that a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services, isn't in compliance with Senate rules.",
      "The parliamentarian also weighed in on the provider tax, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs, in a blow to the Senate GOP's initial plan.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding, in part by incrementally lowering provider taxes from 6% to 3.5% by 2032. The timeline is delayed by one year from the Senate GOP's initial proposal, after the issue became one of the bill's sticking points in the Senate in recent weeks. It's a departure from the House-passed bill, which sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "The bill also includes a rural hospital stabilization fund after some GOP senators expressed concern over how rural hospitals could be impacted by the Medicaid restrictions, allocating $25 billion for rural hospitals over the same period that the provider taxes would be lowered.",
      "Increasing the state and local tax deduction, or SALT",
      "The package also includes an increase to the cap on the state and local tax deduction, raising it from $10,000 to $40,000. After five years, it would return to $10,000, a departure from the House-passed bill.",
      "The issue was a major sticking point in the House, where blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support without the increase to the deduction. But with no Republicans hailing from blue states in the Senate, the upper chamber has been contending with its own dynamics.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The Senate bill still shifts the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps, to some states. The program is currently fully funded by the federal government.",
      "The federal government would continue to fully fund the benefits for states that have an error payment rate below 6%, beginning in 2028. States with error rates\u00a0above 6% would be on the hook for 5% to 15% of the costs. States are also given some flexibility in calculating their share.",
      "However, Alaska and Hawaii would receive temporary exemptions from the cost-sharing requirement. Both states would receive a two-year reprieve if the Department of Agriculture determines they are \"actively implementing a corrective action plan.\"",
      "The package also aligns with the House version on age requirements for able-bodied adults to qualify for SNAP benefits. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. Both the Senate and House bills would update the age requirement to 18-64, with some exemptions for parents.",
      "Alaska and Hawaii could also receive waivers for the work requirements if it's determined that they're making a \"good faith effort\" to comply.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "The legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, going beyond the $4 trillion outlined in the House-passed bill, as Congress faces a deadline to address the debt limit later this summer.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid-July, outlining that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as early as August, when Congress is on recess.",
      "By addressing the debt ceiling as part of the larger package, Republicans in Congress are aiming to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue. Unlike most other legislation in the Senate, the budget reconciliation process that governs the package requires a simple majority, rather than the 60-vote threshold to move forward with a bill.",
      "Child tax credit",
      "The current $2,000 child tax credit is set to return to the pre-2017 level of $1,000 in 2026. The tax credit would permanently increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike. The House version reverts the increase to $2,000 after 2028.",
      "Limits on overtime and tips deductions",
      "The bill would allow individuals to deduct up to $25,000 for tip wages and $12,500 for overtime. But the provisions would expire in 2028. The Senate bill would reduce the deductions for individuals making over $150,000, while the House bill does not include income limits.",
      "Changes to standard deduction",
      "The Senate wants to permanently expand the basic standard deduction, which was nearly doubled in 2017. The increases will expire at the end of the year. The House bill, however, would expand the deduction only through 2028.",
      "Asylum fee",
      "The legislation also includes a minimum $100 fee for those seeking asylum, down from the $1,000 fee outlined in the House bill. The Senate parliamentarian ruled out the $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and other fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "Pause on AI regulations",
      "A revised proposal on a 10-year pause on state regulations on artificial intelligence also made it into the Senate bill. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-coordinated-spending-campaign-finance/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:49:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration and Republicans have argued that the limits on coordinated spending violate the First Amendment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether federal limits on coordinated spending by political parties in support of their candidates violate the First Amendment.",
      "The court's review of an appeals court ruling that upheld the coordinated spending limits set up a high-stakes campaign finance dispute that will be heard in the court's next term, with a decision expected just months before the 2026 midterm elections. The Supreme Court allowed the Democratic National Committee and other party committees to intervene and participate in the case, since the Justice Department has joined the GOP in calling on the court to strike down the restrictions as unconstitutional.",
      "The case is likely to join a string of recent rulings from the Supreme Court's conservative majority that have unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, allowing more money to flow into politics. In its landmark 2010 decision in the case Citizens United v. FEC, the justices struck down prohibitions on political spending by corporations. Four years later, the high court invalidated a limit on the amount of money a donor could contribute to federal candidates in a two-year election cycle.",
      "In the latest case, which involved GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that a cap on the amount of post-election contributions that can be used to repay a candidate who loaned money to their own campaign was unconstitutional.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court now, brought by Republican political committees and JD Vance when he was a candidate for the Senate, involves a 50-year-old provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio challenged the constitutionality of the coordinated party expenditure limits. Chabot lost his reelection bid in November 2022.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. The composition of the high court has changed significantly in the 24 years since that decision, and it now has a 6-3 conservative majority. Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the 2001 ruling, is the only justice who is still on the court.",
      "In its decision, the 6th Circuit's 10-judge majority acknowledged that \"the law and facts have changed\" since the 2001 ruling and said \"political campaigns and political spending have changed in the last two decades.\"",
      "The Republicans appealed to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment. They are represented by two lawyers with ties to President Trump: Noel Francisco, who was solicitor general during his first term, and Don McGahn, who served as White House counsel.",
      "\"Congress has built a wall of separation between party and candidate, forcing party committees to figure out how to get their candidates elected without hearing from them,\" they wrote in their appeal. \"That is the campaign 'equivalent of prohibiting communication between a coach and quarterback late in a tied game.'\"",
      "The Republicans urged the Supreme Court to either clarify its 2001 decision upholding the spending limits or overrule it outright, calling it an \"aberration\" that was \"plainly wrong the day it was decided.\"",
      "Because political parties cannot coordinate with their candidates, the GOP committees said donors are directing more of their money to outside groups like superPACs.",
      "\"The result is a more polarized process in which political parties \u2014 an institutional force almost as old as 'the formation of the Republic itself' \u2014 have been supplanted by less-restricted speakers,\" they said.",
      "Backing the Republicans in their appeal is the Trump administration, which is not defending the law before the Supreme Court. In a May filing with the justices, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the government agrees that the expenditure limits violate the First Amendment by restricting parties' right to engage in political speech in coordination with their candidates.",
      "\"The core function of a political party is to promote its candidates to the electorate. A party performs that function most effectively in cooperation with the candidates themselves,\" Sauer wrote. \"By restricting that cooperation, the party-expenditure limit severely burdens the rights of parties and candidates alike.\"",
      "The Justice Department has a longstanding policy of defending federal statutes facing constitutional challenges, but Sauer said it determined \"this is the rare case that warrants an exception to that general approach.\"",
      "Because the government sided with the Republicans in arguing that the limits should be invalidated, Democratic Party committees sought to intervene because there was no one to defend the law and the 6th Circuit's decision. The Justice Department did not oppose their intervention.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/organizing-summer-democrats/",
    "published": "Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Democrats found themselves locked out of power in Washington after the 2024 presidential election. Now campaign groups are readying an effort to help the party regain power.",
    "story": [
      "An alliance of leading national Democratic groups is preparing a new effort this summer focused on driving voter engagement as the party tries to regain support following its defeats in 2024.",
      "The plans, first obtained by CBS News, fall under the label of what these groups have dubbed \"Organizing Summer.\" While this year has relatively few major statewide elections,\u00a0 such as gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, the 2026 midterms will be a crucial test for a party that is trying to respond to the lessons learned from Republicans' wins in last year's campaigns, including the presidential race. The groups behind the summer organizing effort include the Democratic National Committee,\u00a0 the Democrats' coalition of state parties as well as the campaign arms for House, Senate and gubernatorial contests.",
      "The DNC alone intends to initially invest a six-figure dollar amount in the wide-ranging effort, with plans to scale to seven figures as the summer goes on.",
      "\"For too long, the DNC has been a D.C. institution, and we're trying to get the DNC out of DC and into the states through this program,\" a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans said.",
      "The summer program is focused on voter engagement and registration, particularly with voters who wouldn't otherwise hear Democrats' messaging. The DNC has signed up 16,000 volunteers, twice as many as it typically has in an off-election year, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. As part of the summer effort, Democrats will urge volunteers to connect with voters in less politically dominated parts of life, with the outline of the plan pointing to community groups, book clubs and social media platforms as examples.",
      "The plans include developing a \"direct pathway to share feedback they receive from voters, and what they are seeing online, helping the party inform its messaging and strategy on an ongoing basis,\" according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the program.",
      "\"We are deploying an army of thousands of volunteers to activate their communities, register voters, and make sure the Republicans who are putting billionaires ahead of working and middle class Americans lose their elections in 2025 and lose their seats in the midterms,\" DNC chairman Ken Martin said in a statement.",
      "National Democrats are also keen on trying to build momentum after party infighting spilled out into the open during the early months of Martin's tenure leading the DNC.",
      "An April announcement from activist David Hogg and his political organization, Leaders We Deserve,\u00a0 detailing plans to \"start primarying out-of-touch, ineffective House Democrats in solid blue seats\" caused a rift with Martin and other party leaders. This eventually led to Hogg losing his position as a DNC vice chair. Soon after that standoff ended, attention grew around\u00a0two leaders from major labor unions exiting the DNC, bringing about more questions about the direction of the party moving forward.",
      "Many Democrats have been uneasy about the infighting, wanting to focus instead on trying to win elections in the coming months and years.",
      "In an attempt to help do that, Democrats' summer initiative includes all\u00a035 of the GOP districts\u00a0the House Democrats' campaign arm is focusing on at this stage, U.S. Senate races in North Carolina and Maine and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, according to the Democratic strategist familiar with the plans.",
      "Democrats are already attempting to use\u00a0 President Trump's wide-ranging\u00a0 \"big, beautiful bill\" making its way through Congress as a flashpoint in the midterms, and that work will also be a major point of the summer organizing program.",
      "The GOP House version of the legislation, which narrowly passed the chamber,\u00a0continues\u00a0major parts of Mr. Trump's first term Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Yet it also includes more politically volatile changes, such as enforcing Medicaid work requirements and changes to federal food assistance. Senate Republicans have been working to try and pass their own version of the bill as well. As the process plays out, national Republicans already appear to be centering a major part of the GOP's chances in the 2026 midterms on Mr. Trump's agenda legislation.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes common-sense policies supported by a majority of Americans,\" House GOP campaign arm chairman Richard Hudson\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media recently. \"@HouseGOP Republicans are putting Americans first while Democrats defend the waste, fraud, abuse, and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Last year's elections sent Republicans to Washington with unified control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, giving them clear paths to act on Mr. Trump's agenda. Democrats are facing a difficult map to try and reclaim the Senate in 2026, meaning that the left's best hopes at gaining power back in Washington are likely centered on winning back the House next year. Since Mr. Trump's second inauguration, Democratic governors have proven to be a major counter to his actions, meaning that either maintaining or winning governor's offices around the country is a critical goal for the party as well. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, for instance, sued Trump and others earlier this month over the\u00a0federal deployment\u00a0of state National Guard members following immigration protests.",
      "Whether efforts like the summer organizing will be enough to help the party moving forward is likely to be closely watched among politicians and operatives looking to build campaigns not just for the 2026 midterms, but the 2028 presidential election cycle as well.",
      "\"Our job this summer is to make sure working families know exactly who is responsible for taking food off their table and ripping away their health care,\" Martin said in his statement.",

    "story": [
      "D. Wayne Lukas, the Hall of Famer who became one of the most accomplished horse trainers with seven Preakness, four Kentucky Derby and four Belmont Stakes wins, has died. He was 89.",
      "His family said Sunday in a statement to Churchill Downs, the Louisville, Kentucky, racecourse where he won his first Derby in 1988, that Lukas died Saturday night at his home.\u00a0Lukas had been hospitalized\u00a0with a severe MRSA blood infection that caused significant damage to his heart and digestive system and worsened pre-existing chronic conditions.",
      "\"Wayne devoted his life not only to horses but to the industry \u2014 developing generations of horsemen and horsewomen and growing the game by inviting unsuspecting fans into the winner's circle,\" his family said in the statement. \"Whether he was boasting about a maiden 2-year-old as the next Kentucky Derby winner or offering quiet words of advice before a big race, Wayne brought heart, grace, and grit to every corner of the sport. His final days were spent at home in Kentucky, where he chose peace, family, and faith.\"",
      "Lukas won 15 Triple Crown races, including the Kentucky Derby four times. Only good friend Bob Baffert has more Triple Crown victories, and Lukas owns a record-tying 20 in the Breeders' Cup World Championships.",
      "\"The whole secret of this game, I think, is being able to read the horse: Read what he needs, what he doesn't need, what he can't do, what he can do,\" Lukas said in May before his 34th and final Preakness Stakes. \"That's the whole key. Everybody's got the blacksmith, everybody's got to the same bed available, the feed man. We all can hire a good jockey. We all can hire a pretty good exercise rider if we've got the means, so what the hell is the difference? The horse is the difference and what we do with him in reading him.\"",
      "No one in the race's 149-year history has saddled more horses in the Preakness than Lukas, with 48 since debuting in 1980. He told CBS Baltimore in 2013 that he thought he had a knack for identifying horses with talent.",
      "\"Of the six horses I bought last year, three are in the Preakness,\" he said. \"So I'm pretty proud of that, after looking at 3,000.\"",
      "Retired jockey Donna Brothers, now an NBC Sports analyst, once called Lukas \"a magician\" for his ability to evolve a horse's potential. \"He's been doing it for a number of years, and he can continue to produce those sorts of results,\" Brothers said in 2022.",
      "Lukas was affectionately known around the barns and the racetrack as \"Coach\" because he coached high school basketball before his professional career with horses began. Even with months to go before his 90th birthday, he would get up on his pony in the early morning hours and go out to the track himself, rather than letting his assistants do the day-to-day work.",
      "Born Darnell Wayne Lukas on Sept. 2, 1935, in Wisconsin as the second of three children, he rose to prominence in the sport with quarter horses in races that are effectively sprints. He moved into thoroughbreds in the late 1970s and won his first Preakness with Codex in 1980.",
      "Lukas has 4,967 documented victories in thoroughbred racing, with his horses earning more than $310 million from more than 30,600 starts.",
      "\"Today we lost one of the great champions of Churchill Downs and one of the most significant figures in Thoroughbred racing over the last 50 years,\" Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen said. \"We will miss his humor, his wisdom and his unmatched capacity to thrill the fans with the performances of his horses on our sport's biggest days.\"",
      "Achieving something of a career renaissance over the past decade, one he credits to finding the right owners willing to spend money on horses, Lukas won the Preakness last year with Seize the Grey. Asked what motivates him to keep doing his job well into his late 80s, he gave a pep talk fit for a locker room before a big game.",
      "\"If you have a passion, you eliminate all the excuses,\" Lukas said. \"That's how it works. You get up early. You go without a meal. You drive. You go without sleep - as long as you got the passion. Don't let that sofa pull you down. It's a little easy when that alarm goes off to say, 'Oh my God, I don't know if I really want to do this today.' Erase that. The most important decision you'll ever make in your life is your attitude decision. Make it early, and make the right one.\"",

      "\"Melissa Hortman will be remembered as the most consequential speaker in Minnesota history \u2013 and I'll always remember her as a close friend, a mentor, and the most talented legislator I've ever known,\" Walz said in his eulogy. \"For seven years, I've had the privilege of signing her bills into law. And I know that millions of Minnesotans will get to live better lives because she and Mark chose public service.\"",
      "Melissa Hortman was remembered for her leadership, sense of humor and strong commitment to doing good work to improve the lives of Minnesotans.",
      "\"Her mission was to get as much good done for as many people as possible,\" Walz said. \"That focus on people is what made Melissa so effective. She knew how to get her way, no doubt about it. But she never made anyone feel like they'd gotten rolled at the negotiating table.\"",
      "Mark Hortman shared his wife's passion for helping others, Walz said, the two having met at a mentorship event in Washington, D.C., more than 30 years ago.",
      "\"...There's a part of the story that belongs only to those of us fortunate enough to know the people behind that legacy,\" Walz said. \"It takes place at CR's Billiards, where Mark loved to shoot pool on Monday nights. It takes place in the garden, where Melissa fussed over her lilies like they were wayward members of the caucus. It takes place in the kitchen, where Mark fed his sourdough starter and Melissa mixed margaritas and baked cakes and Gilbert begged for scraps and the sound of laughter filled the air.\"",
      "The governor encouraged people to learn from the way the Hortmans lived to honor their legacy.",

Let's do it because of the way they lived, and the way they led. With joy and passion. With respect and empathy. With purpose and humility.\"",

      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar was unable to attend the Hortmans' funeral in person, but praised their leadership.",
      "\"They met as volunteers working to help kids, and that dedication to serving others never wavered,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.. \"Sophie and Colin said that the best way to honor their parents is 'to do something, whether big or small, to make our community just a little better for someone else.' I can think of no better way to honor Melissa and Mark.\"",
      "In the days following their deaths, the Hortman children, in a statement remembering their parents, encouraged people to honor their memory with a list of actions, including baking, petting a dog and planting a tree.",

    "summary": "Tens of millions of Americans are unable to save for retirement through their jobs. \"That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis,\" one expert says.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

      "The new transitional government has blamed sanctions \u2014 which include penalties on third countries for doing business in Syria \u2014 for the country's inability to pay civil service salaries, reconstruct sizable chunks of war-ravaged cities and rebuild a health care system decimated by war.",

      "\"That would be a disaster. We have already seen what happened in Libya, what happened to Syria. Iraq, actually, is a big example for us. That's a disaster for the region,\" he says. \"There will be a failed state that there might be terrorism coming out of.\"",
      "That threat may no longer feel imminent, and the ceasefire President Trump brokered between Iran and Israel has held for nearly a week, but Bathaei \u2014 relying entirely on gut feelings that come from more than 35 years as a journalist in Iran \u2014 still struggles to find optimism.",

      "\"I don't think the Iranian leadership were ready, or believed that the U.S. might attack Iran on that level,\" adds Bathaei.",
      "Now, he's worried that the U.S. could attack Iran again.",
      "The solution, Bathaei believes, is for both sides to sit down and talk it out.",
      "\"They're not talking to each other. If they sit down and start a conversation or even visit each other \u2014 I mean, Iranian politicians go and visit the U.S., U.S. politicians coming here and visit Iran \u2014 I believe a big portion of this misunderstanding can be eliminated. I'm not saying Iran and the U.S. will go be a friend, be allies, in the near, foreseeable future, but I think it's not something impossible.\"",

      "Iran's nuclear capabilities suffered \"severe damage\" in last week's U.S. airstrikes but not \"total damage,\" said the man in charge of the world's global nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. \"One cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.\"",
      "\"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all,\" IAEA director general Rafael Mariano Grossi said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.\"",
      "The U.S. launched three strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities on June 21, following more than a week of Israeli attacks, which President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said had \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "But Grossi's comments appeared to support an early assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), which suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months. The Trump administration has slammed the DIA's assessment as \"low confidence,\" and Hegseth and other officials on Thursday went after the media for reporting on a \"leaked\" report.",
      "At a briefing Thursday, reporters questioned Hegseth repeatedly on whether Iran had moved its stocks of enriched uranium before the Israeli and U.S. strikes began. The defense secretary responded that he was \"not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise.\"",
      "Grossi on Sunday said Iran did not share that they had any plans to move the enriched uranium, but at the same time \"there was no physical time\" for Iran to share that information.",
      "The IAEA director general also conceded that it's \"logical to presume that when [Iran] announce[s] that they are going to be taking protective measures\" that moving the enriched uranium \"could be part of it.\" But he also emphasized that \"this is why it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.\"",
      "Brennan pushed Grossi that since it's unclear if the uranium had been moved and all the centrifuges cannot be accounted for, there's an open question that Iran could still \"sprint towards a bomb\u2026if they wanted to.\" Grossi said he didn't want to be an \"alarmist,\" but \"we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened.\"",
      "\"Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there,\" Grossi said. \"The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily.\"",
      "Grossi confirmed that his IAEA inspectors were never able to verify Iran's claims that its nuclear program was only for peaceful ends and that it was not trying to develop a weapon.",
      "\"We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending,\" Grossi said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Saturday that there were calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of Grossi.",
      "When asked about alleged threats against nuclear inspectors, Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, said in a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation\" that Iran is not threatening nuclear inspectors, including Grossi.",
      "Nuclear inspectors \"are in Iran,\" Iravani said. He said they are in a \"safe condition,\" but \"they cannot have access to our site.\"",
      "Iravani also said that since Iran is a member of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), nuclear \"enrichment is our right, and an inalienable right, and we want to implement this right.\"",

It is a very clear law of the- our parliament that they have been suspended, our cooperation with IAEA, because the agency has not implemented their rights, their responsibility. Due to this it is a conditional law, and as long as this condition has not been set, so our cooperation with IAEA will be suspended. But whenever it set out as according to the law, so we can have- resume our cooperation. But there is no any threat against the general director of the IAEA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was published in Israel- in Iran's \"Kayhan\" newspaper. Your foreign minister did also say that the IAEA and Grossi himself are malign in intent. Are the IAEA personnel, are the inspectors already inside Iran safe? And can they go back to their work of inspecting your sites?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Exactly. They are in Iran. They are in the safe condition, but the activity has been suspended. They cannot have accesses to our site, but maybe some one, it is individual, opinion of the people that may criticize the IAEA or threat the general director. But we criticize IAEA. We- our assessment is that they have not done their jobs, so they failed and they prepared [inaudible] for such aggression against us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine that you would condemn the calls for his execution?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's--",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: (INAUDIBLE) --media.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know, and you're speaking to us from the UN. President Trump said Friday that Iranian officials want to meet with him personally, and he said that will be soon. Mr. Ambassador, is Tehran planning to drop this demand of indirect communication with the United States, and will you begin speaking with the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: See you, we were in the negotiation, but because we know that any dispute between Iran and United States or other parts of the JCPOA cannot be resolved without the negotiation and using the peaceful means for- to resolve this dispute. So we are in the negotiation, and we are ready for the negotiation, but after this aggression, it is not proper condition for a new round of the negotiation, and there is no request for negotiation and meeting with the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the United States is wanting to meet with Iran to talk, and while the supreme leader issued a statement saying Iran had dealt the U.S. a slap in the face, after that, President Trump said he had actually stopped Israel from going further and had stopped Israel from an attempt to kill your supreme leader. Why not take the offer of a diplomatic lifeline? Because he seems to be offering one.",
      "AMB. IRAVANI: It is very gross violation of the international law that- threatening the Supreme Leader of Islamic Republic of Iran or any head of state, they have impunity from any attack. So we should understand that, what is the principle and condition for any negotiation? Negotiation is- has its- the principles, and it is a give and take process. So we should engage in the negotiation and discuss with each other, maybe we reach to a conclusion or not, but the unconditional surrender is not negotiation. It is dictating the policy toward us. If they are ready for negotiation, they will find us ready for that, but if they want to dictate us, it is impossible for any negotiation with them,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your time today. We will be watching and waiting to see if there are any diplomatic opportunities. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, Pfizer board member and non-executive chairman of the board at Illumina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For a look now at some of the changes to America's public health policies under the Trump administration, we're joined by former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board at Pfizer and is now the Chairman of the Board at Illumina. Good morning. Good to see you.",
      "DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Dr. Gottlieb, you worked in the first Trump administration. This second Trump administration seems very different in its approach to public health on a lot of fronts. One of them was really laid bare this week with this newly remade Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. Secretary Kennedy had dismissed about 17 members of the existing board and put in some members of his own choice. And in a video, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics said federal immunization policy is, quote, 'no longer a credible process' and it's being politicized at the expense of children. That's a pretty stunning statement. Do you agree with the Academy of Pediatrics?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, you're right. I worked in the first Trump administration. I was fortunate to do that and proud to serve in that administration. I think we did a lot of important things on public health. We presided over the first cell and gene therapy approvals. The president tried to expand access to those treatments through the Right to Try legislation that he championed. He supported the FDA on an effort to try to keep tobacco products out of the hands of kids, record number of generic approvals, and a lot of other accomplishments. I think a lot of people on my side of the political aisle feel that a lot of these policies that Secretary Kennedy is championing are- are going to be contained to vaccines and not bleed into a broader public health doctrine. I think that's not right. I think there's a lot of people now who don't think these things are particularly political, or shouldn't be, and don't think these decisions should be politically decided, who are going to find when they go to the doctor's office that vaccines that they may want to protect their lives or the lives of their families aren't going to be available. This does look like a political process right now. The secretary is going after issues that have long been bugaboos of him and his anti-vax group, Children's Health Defense. I don't think that's mistakable at this point. I think that he would probably acknowledge that. That he's taking on issues that he's championed for the last 20 years to restrict access to certain vaccines. That's going to grow. The list is growing, and it's going to start to be very tangible for people and go well beyond just the COVID vaccine, which is, I think, what most people think about when they perceive this administration's, or the secretary's efforts, to try to restrict access to vaccines.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the specific things from this meeting was advice to avoid flu vaccines containing an ingredient called thimerosal. Right around the same time as the meeting, the CDC removed information from its website that debunked claims that this ingredient was linked to autism. Secretary Kennedy says it's- it's journalists who are obscuring the truth. What do people need to know about the flu vaccine and this ingredient?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so this is an old ingredient. It's a preservative used in multi-dose vials of flu vaccine, primarily. Only a very small percentage of flu vaccine vials still contain it. What it is is an ingredient that's added to multi-dose vials because those vials you're going to go in and out of with different needles as you administer the vaccine to different patients. So they're not single dose injections. They're multi-dose vials that primarily used in some busy clinics, almost exclusively in adults right now. Back in the early 2000s, I was at FDA when we reformulated the vaccine, so we compelled manufacturers to reformulate the vaccines to take this preservative out. Not because we thought it was unsafe, but because there was a lot of consternation among anti-vax groups that they thought that there was a link between this ingredient and autism. The ingredient does contain small amounts of ethylmercury, not methylmercury, ethylmercury, which is the same kind of mercury found in fish, in very small- very small amounts. And so we compelled the manufacturers to reformulate the vast majority of vaccines, still four percent of flu vaccines that get administered, mostly to adults, are from these multi-dose vials. This has long been a bugaboo of the secretary and his group, the Children's Health Defense Fund. In fact, the only presentation at the ACIP meeting was from the head of that group. And you're right that there was a countering analysis from the CDC officials asserting that there's no link between thimerosal and autism. That- that analysis was taken down from the website. The secretary put out a statement that said that it wasn't- it didn't go through proper review.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, Dr. Gottlieb, and talk more with you on the other side of this. These are complicated issues I want to dig into with you. So we hope all of you will stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, just to pick back up, we were talking about the meeting that took place this past week with the newly reconstituted Advisory Committee on Immunization. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, you know him, he's a doctor. He has oversight and chairs the Health Committee. He called for the meeting to be canceled because he said there's no CDC director in place. And when it comes to these appointees, he said many of them 'do not have significant experience studying microbiology, epidemiology or immunology' and they may have 'preconceived bias' against mRNA vaccines. It's- I'm not a doctor, but it seems to me that experience in immunology would be important if you're advising on immunizations. His counsel was ignored here. Is there any check on Secretary Kennedy, at this point? Is there a need to get a CDC director in place quickly?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, well, the CDC director had a confirmation hearing this week, and hopefully she'll be in place soon. I think she's quite strong and a good pick for that job. The board, this ACIP board, isn't fully constituted. There's only seven members on the board. At its peak membership, it has about 15. And you're right, a lot of the people who have been appointed don't have deep experience, or any experience, quite frankly, in vaccine science. They are people who have been ideologically aligned with Secretary Kennedy in the past and worked with him, many of them, not all of them. And I think that that isn't something that even the secretary would probably dispute at this time, and it did lead to some awkward moments at that meeting. For example, you know, one member had to have explained to him the difference between an antibody prophylaxis and a vaccine. So there were evidence in that discussion where the CDC directors had to provide some, quite frankly, remedial assistance to help brief these members on the basis of vaccine science. So it did show, hopefully, once they fully constitute that board, you're going to get more balance on it. I think some people are skeptical. I remain hopeful that there will be some good members that get seated eventually.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things about the American health system is that question of continued innovation. Earlier this month, the FDA approved a twice yearly injection of an HIV prevention drug called lenacapavir. How significant is an innovation like that, and given the environment you're talking about, will these new advisors get in the way of being able to get those kind of things to market?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, this shouldn't come before ACIP. So this is a therapeutic. It's a long acting antiviral that provides six months of protection against HIV and was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection in a population that was high risk of contracting HIV. So it's a change in the formulation of an antiviral that allows it to be administered just twice a year and provide sustained exposure to the benefits of that antiviral. We're seeing a lot of innovation like this. There was also news this week from a small biotech company that I don't have any involvement with, that they had developed a pill that could provide sustained protection against flu. So it's an antiviral, but it is formulated in a way where it- it could be administered once ahead of flu season, to provide protection across the entire season, and also look to be very effective. So we're seeing a lot of innovations like this. What I'm worried about is innovation in vaccine science. I work on the venture capital side, where we make investments in- in new companies, and there has been a pullback of biotech startups that have been looking to develop new vaccines, for example, vaccines for Epstein-Barr Virus, which we know is linked to certain B-cell lymphomas, and maybe is linked to multiple sclerosis. That- that's a new area of science, the potential to vaccinate children against that, much like we vaccinate kids against HPV right now and prevent cervical cancer and other types of cancers. Maybe in the future, we may be vaccinating for EBV, but there's been a lot of pullback to that kind of investment. So I think we're going to see less innovation in vaccine science as a result of the environment we're in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary Kennedy was asked this week about the declarations in some states to start removing fluoride from water. Oklahoma made some moves that direction. He said you're going to see 'probably slightly more cavities,' but 'there's a direct inverse correlation between the amount of fluoride in your water and your loss of IQ.' What should parents be thinking about when they hear things like that?",
      "DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this has been a long standing issue, another issue that Secretary Kennedy has championed over his career, this perceived- perception that there's a link between fluoride and water and some neurotoxic effects of that. That's been studied thoroughly. It's been, I think, fully debunked. There's very small amounts of fluoride in water, and at the levels that it's put into the water supply, it's been demonstrated to be safe. CDC's- has data showing that there's a 25% reduction in dental caries as a result of fluoride that's added routinely to the water supply. It's not just a question of increased dental cavities, but also oral health more generally, which we know is correlated to systemic health.",

      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your Republican colleagues in the Senate have been working hard on trying to get this bill together, and they're probably going to eek it past.",
      "REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's even with GOP lawmakers like Thom Tillis saying they can't stomach what this is going to do to Medicaid, an estimated $930 billion in cuts to it. That's more significant than what you all had voted to do in the House. Are you going to vote again for final passage if it looks like this?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I'm going to vote for it for this reason. I think these numbers, it's all about waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, Medicaid. What I'm voting for is a border security measure, $80 billion,\u00a0 $12 billion to reimburse states like mine. I'm voting for $150 billion that will go to our Department of Defense at a time when we saw with Iran, is desperately needed. The world is on fire, Eastern Europe, Indo-Pacific. And then the tax cuts. I mean, if we don't extend these tax cuts, it'll be the largest tax increase in American history for those three reasons. I'm a yes. I think everyone in the House, they know the peril they're in if they vote no on this thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean the peril they're in?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think, first of all, it's good for the nation. Secondly, they know that their-their jobs are at risk. Not just from the president, but from the voting- the American people. Our base back home will not reelect us to office if we vote no on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it about reelection, or is it about the policies, right?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No-no. It's about- it's about- it's great for the country, and I've outlined the three top points.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to help me understand then- you have such narrow margins in the house, and you look at these projections from like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, they say it violates the House instructions by $500 billion or more, what the Senate just put together here, and that deficits could rise more than $3 trillion. How do you get that through when you have fellow conservatives who are fiscal hawks and saying, I can't get with this, like Chip Roy?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Not to get into the weeds on the economics, but the dynamic scoring is not taken into account here by the Congressional Budget Office. That means that when you cut taxes, you actually get increased revenues to the Treasury. And that's something we saw under President Kennedy, under President Reagan, and under President Bush.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chip Roy and some of these other fiscal conservatives are going to come along for the ride?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, I think at the end of the day, I think they're going to vote for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You do. Let's talk about some of the threats that you mentioned there, at home and abroad. You've been briefed on the actions against Iran. The IAEA director told us here that Iran has capabilities and could be up and running within a matter of months. Do you think it is an overstatement by the White House or a mistake to declare mission accomplished?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Well, first of all, I respect the IAEA. Their job is to inspect not to be an intelligence agency, so they don't really have the clear intelligence analysis that I would attribute to our intelligence community like the CIA. We met with Director Ratcliffe. It was not just his decision. These are career and intelligence officers that have been at the CIA for over 30 years that made this assessment that it was severely damaged and sets a program back a matter of years. In any event, the world and the Middle East is safer today than it was seven days ago, a week ago. That is highlighted by the fact that the proxies didn't light up. Russia didn't come to their- to their aid. China basically ran back for cover. Iran is on its own and psychologically, is very damaged. The deterrence is real. The damage is real. This is a masterful military operation, the likes of which I haven't seen since my father's war, World War Two.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the homeland front, do you then dismiss these concerns about threats? You have the National Terrorism Advisory System that says there's a heightened threat environment in the US. After the strikes, there were federal agents that arrested 11 foreign nationals from Iran, including one who had ties to Hezbollah. Have you seen specific evidence of any kind of threat here in the United States, or is it, as you say, just done and over with?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: No, I have. We picked up 11 Iranians, one a sniper, one IRGC, another one, a known suspected terrorist, just within the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Were they planning to do anything, or did they just happen to have those alliances from the past?",
      "REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't know all the details, but I will tell you the FBI briefed me in a defensive briefing after Soleimani was killed. I was a part of that--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: -- back in 2020--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that I was under indictment in Iran and that I was on that top target list. So, you know, look- is it imminent? I don't know. We have to take it seriously that there could be sleeper cells in the United States, that could go after people like Mike Pompeo, John Bolton, you know- you know- myself and others that were involved in that decision making and including the president of the United States. We know he's been targeted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to detention of migrants here in the United States, it's a high 59,000 detainees, according to ICE. 47% of them, though, lack a criminal record, fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes. Doesn't that show that the numbers- these aren't the worst of the worst.",
      "REP. MCCAUL: Yeah, I was a federal prosecutor for many years. Counterterrorism. You have to prioritize, right? I would prioritize the aggravated felons that my Mayorkas let in, in defiance of federal law. It was shall detain. He said, may detain and let them out into the streets. I would, I would prioritize that first.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would prefer that Homeland Security prioritize them and not run up the numbers the way they are in this--",
      "REP. MCCAUL: I think they're running the numbers up because 15 to 20 million people came under the- under the Biden administration, and they're trying to get some sanity involved in the United States. And I think deterrence is the key here. And Margaret, it is working. You know, the apprehension rate at the border, and Texas is the biggest one, has gone down to almost zero. I mean, the border is just about secure, catch and release is over, and the threats are going away.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. He is the Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Good morning.",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been, probably, sleep-deprived with all of what is happening, but I want to ask you about what's going on in Capitol Hill. Republicans are going to pass this along party lines. It's expected, right? But, it includes things in here that Democrats, including you, had supported, right? The no taxes on tips provision, more money for Border Patrol, expansion of the Child Care Tax Credit upwards of $2,000. Why vote against it, when there are popular provisions within it, and doesn't that just allow the President to say, oh, you want to raise taxes?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You can put as much lipstick on this pig as you want. This will- this will be a political albatross for the Republicans --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Why? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: \u00a0-- because it takes 16 million Americans off of health care coverage with cuts to Medicaid, and cuts to the Obamacare marketplace. That will move us, as a nation, back to the same percentage of uninsured we had before- before Obamacare. And, it's not like these people are not going to get sick. They're going to show up at the emergency room. Rural hospitals are going to shut down. That has been evidenced across the nation. It also goes after food assistance. So we are really in such a place that we're cutting, in my state, a couple hundred thousand people off of school lunches, school breakfasts. They even cut food banks. It's- it's cruel. They have also ended up, at the end of the day, cutting 20,000-plus clean energy jobs. And for what? This was to make sure that the highest, most wealthy Americans can get an extra tax-break. And, as you just saw on your chyron, there, it adds $4.5 trillion to the debt. I think many of my Republican friends know they're walking the plank on this, and we'll see if those who've expressed quiet consternation will actually have the courage of their convictions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of the Republicans are arguing, well, we have to deal with these entitlements and the work requirements and things that may lead to some of the lack of qualifications you talk about. They're not that burdensome. It's volunteer work or part-time work. So, are you overstating it?",
      "SEN. WARNER: No. It's 16 million Americans off of health care. You know, Medicaid cuts- these numbers, they're not my numbers. They're all independent sources. And what- the thing that I don't think people have realized is people say, well, Medicaid, I'm not poor. I, maybe, buy my health insurance through the marketplace. Your rates will go up $800 or $900 a month. And that will trickle through the whole rest of the healthcare market, because if you suddenly take people out of the system, they show up at the emergency room in uncompensated care. The only way those costs get passed on, is higher health insurance to all of us who have traditional coverage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this is so against their own interest, why haven't you been able to peel more Republicans away?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Well, I think we'll see. Even as recently as just an hour ago, some of the special Medicaid provisions for certain states, I think, were disallowed because of the so-called Byrd Rule. It's not over until it's over. I will give you- I will grant that President Trump has been able to hold his party in line in an unprecedented manner. At the other end, this bill will come back and bite them. This is going to do so much damage in terms of, not only health care, food assistance, you know, the whole notion that we are moving towards cleaner energy jobs, all on the chopping block, adding $4 trillion to the debt.\u00a0Tell me, at the end of the day, how that is good for America? I don't think you can make the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Education is another front in this fight with the President. And I want to ask you about what's happening in Virginia. We saw the University of Virginia's President, James Ryan, resign on Friday. This was extraordinary. This was a pressure campaign from the Trump administration over diversity, or so-called DEI programs. In the letter, and I want to read this, Ryan wrote that if he had tried to fight back, hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld. But, he resigned to avoid this. Is that now the playbook for other university presidents: walk away, don't have the fight?",
      "SEN. WARNER: This is the most outrageous action, I think, this crowd has taken on education. We have great public universities in Virginia. We have a very strong governance system, where we have an independent board of visitors appointed by the Governor. Jim Ryan had done a very good job; just completed a major capital campaign. For him to be threatened, and, literally, there was indication that they received the letter that if he didn't resign on a day last week, by five o'clock, all these cuts would take place. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- It was that explicit? --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- It was that explicit. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is- but that sounds personal. That doesn't sound specific to policy or changes. Like, how does the next university president get in line and get the money?",
      "SEN. WARNER: You're shocked it's coming- personal attacks are coming out of this administration? This is, you know- I thought the Republicans were about states' rights. I thought the Republicans were about, let's transfer more power in the States. This federal D.O.E. and Department of Justice should get their nose out of University of Virginia. They are doing damage to our flagship university. And if they can do it here, they'll do it elsewhere. At the end of the day, I understand that, with so many things at stake, that the idea, and I think Jim Ryan laid it out, that he was going to make his personal- personal job more important than these cuts. But, boy, that shouldn't have been the choice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we know that the universe that the administration is looking at more universities, and the assistant A.G., Harmeet Dhillon, indicated that publicly, and University of California is next to the crosshairs, so we're going to be watching that carefully --",
      "SEN. WARNER: They all want to make them like Harvard. They want to take on public universities, the way they have now taken on the Ivys. End of the day, this is going to hurt our\u00a0universities, chase away what world-class talent. And, frankly, if we don't have some level of academic freedom, then what kind of country are we?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your oversight role on intelligence. You were briefed on what's going on with Iran. You said you fear the American people are being given a false sense of comfort with these declarations of mission accomplished. Do you believe U.S. intelligence knows how much of a capability Iran maintains now?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I don't think we have final assessments. Let me- first of all, we don't want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. Secondly, the military performed an extraordinary mission, and I think they affected a great deal of damage to Iran's facilities. But, the idea that the President of the United States, with no data, two hours after the strike, is suddenly hitting the standard of saying total obliteration. That leads us to think that they are out of the game, and we don't know that yet. And, let's just be clear, you can actually set back the major program where they were trying to create, potentially, and there'd been no decision made by the Ayatollah to actually move towards weaponization, but where they could have a weaponized system with a dozen-plus missiles that are nuclear warned. But what they don't know is they didn't, and this was appropriate, I'm not criticizing the administration; they didn't go after the enriched uranium that was Isfahan, at that base, because it's buried so deeply --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- They just hit it with Tomahawks, not the bunker-busters --",
      "SEN. WARNER: -- So, the fact that they can have, still, enriched uranium, they may have some ability to still cascade that- means they could\u00a0still move forward on something, that might be not delivered by a missile, but a bomb in a trunk of a car. And all I don't want is the American people, or, for that matter, our allies in the region, to rely on a term that was set by the President before he had any facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Point taken there on the specifics of the rudimentary bomb. But, coming back to what you just said, there had been no decision by the Supreme Leader to make a weapon. Secretary of State Rubio, on this program, last Sunday, told me it was irrelevant, the answer to that question, because Iran had everything it needed to make and build a weapon. So, based on what you know, was there an emergency? Was there a reason the US had to act in the moment it did?",
      "SEN. WARNER:\u00a0 We were on the verge of what could have been a much greater war, in terms of Iran and Israel spreading to the whole region. Was there the imminent emergency that would trigger? Because lots of presidents have looked at taking this action, I think that's- that's very debatable. If, at the end of the day, we end up where this peace holds, and Iran doesn't strike back, Hallelujah. But, what we don't know, for example, is Iran going to try to hit us on cyber with this administration cutting, literally, half of our cyber-security personnel in this country? So, I just want to make sure that we- we do this in a measured way. The military did great. We have set them back. But let's not pretend that they don't have any capabilities. And the only way we can get resolution on that, Margaret, and Secretary Rubio acknowledged this in the brief, is if we have boots on the ground with inspectors. That means we've got to go to diplomacy. If America and Iran start negotiating this week, face-to-face, that would be good.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we were- we will talk to the man who directs those boots on the grounds, potentially, the inspectors later on in the program from the IAEA. Thank you very much, Senator. We're going to have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Mr. Trump took office in January, attempts to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed, faltering over one major sticking point: whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.",
      "Mahmoud Merdawi, a Hamas official, accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying in remarks on the Telegram messaging app that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages.",

      "Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something the group refuses.",
      "The\u00a0war in Gaza\u00a0began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking roughly 250 hostage, about 50 of whom remain captive, with less than half believed to be alive.",

The ministry does not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but says more than half of the dead are women and children.",
      "The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza. Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.",
      "Trump slams Netanyahu corruption trial",
      "The Gaza message wasn't the only Middle East-related post by Mr. Trump this weekend. On Saturday evening, he doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it \"a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure.\" \u00a0It comes just days after the president intervened to support Netanyahu's attack on Iran's nuclear program, using special U.S. bunker buster bombs.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, that will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on June 29, 2025. The interview was taped on June 27, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA. Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, welcome to the program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL RAFAEL MARIANO GROSSI: Thank you very much, Margaret. Good to talk to you again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director General, there is so much happening. I'm hoping you can walk us through what you know. Iran's foreign minister has said that the damage to their nuclear facilities from the U.S. bombing is significant and serious. We know Israel has also killed a number of top Iranian nuclear scientists. What exactly is Iran's capability at this moment?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, yes, and I think you can pick and choose any adjective to characterize this, but you will see that there is an agreement in describing this as a very serious level of damage. It can be, you know, described in different ways, but it's clear that what happened in particular in Fordo, Natanz, Isfahan, where Iran used to have and still has, to some degree, capabilities in terms of treatment, conversion and enrichment of uranium have been destroyed to an important degree. Some is still standing. So there is, of course, an important setback in terms of those- of those capabilities. This is- this is clear. And now the important issue- the important thing is, what are the next steps? Now the characterization of the damage, I think we can, you know, speculate, and still, until, of course, the Iranians themselves will have to go there and sift through the, you know, rubble and look at what is the exact degree of the damage. At some point, the IAEA will have to return. Although our job is not to assess damage, but to re-establish the knowledge of the activities that take place there, and the access to the material, which is very, very important, the material that they will be producing if they continue with this activity. This is contingent on other, you see, everything is connected. This is- this is contingent on negotiations which may or may not restart, so- so what we see this here, I think we have a snapshot of- of- of a program which has been very seriously damaged, to quote Dr. Araghchi. And now what we need to focus on is on the next steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned there diplomacy. President Trump has been calling for diplomatic talks with Iran to settle all the issues around the nuclear program. I know you were in regular contact with envoy Steve Witkoff. Are you talking to him now? Will the IAEA be involved in any agreement?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, at some point we will have to be, because if his efforts, which I support wholeheartedly, succeed, this will come to a point where there is some agreement, some understanding on things that Iran will continue doing, and some things where there could be an agreement on certain restrictions. And of course, who is going to verify that is the IAEA so this is why we're in constant contact. Now they need to reconnect. And it's not going to be easy, one can imagine, after the traumatic events that took place. Even for us, you may have seen that I wrote to Foreign Minister Araghchi a few days ago, immediately, I would say, after the cease-fire was considered to be holding, and I said to him that we should perhaps sit down and analyze in a gradual way the reconnection, the modalities for the inspectors to go- to go back. So there is a level where the IAEA is not involved, and this is the direct conversation. What is the deal? And then, of course, we will be connecting to make sure that that deal stands and it's verifiable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, Tehran just passed a law saying they want to suspend cooperation with the IAEA inspectors. The foreign minister said he had no plans to let you personally, Mr. Director General, into the country. Does that mean Iran will completely block all inspectors? Do those you already have in the country have any access?",
      "GROSSI: Well, certainly I hope this is not the case. I think that what the foreign minister said is that they were looking into this law and how this law would impact our activities. I think it's time- this is why it's so important that we sit down around the table and we look into this. Iran- and I think nobody has put that in question, and I hope nobody will, is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, like more than 190 countries in the world. So- so, that implies that they have to work with the- with the agency. So we have to go- we have been going through this law that they have, that the Majles approved, and we see that they are talking about cooperation on the basis of- of the security and the safety of their sites. I think that is not incompatible with the inspection work that needs to take place. But of course, it's not Rafael Grossi and Margaret Brennan discussing this that we are going to solve it. I think we- I have to sit down with- with- with Iran and look into this, because at the end of the day, this whole thing, after the military strikes, will have to have a long lasting solution, which cannot be but a diplomatic one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're not kicking- they're not kicking out your inspectors at this point?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Not in this sense. I would not say that I am looking with interest and with some concern what they have approved. But of course, it's their law. It is their parliament. But you know, here there are legal implications. An international treaty, of course, takes precedence. You cannot invoke an internal law not to abide with an international treaty. But Iran is not saying that at the moment, and I think this is constructive. So this is why I think we have to go down into the details, because the work will have to continue, otherwise nobody will have an idea of what is happening in Iran. Iran will continue with a nuclear program, the contours of which are still to be seen and will be I am sure, part of these negotiations, which I hope, will be resuming soon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran officially reported weeks ago that they were going to take measures in advance of these strikes to try to protect their nuclear assets. Did they share with the IAEA what those plans were? Where they were going to stash things like centrifuges, the machines that help enrich fuel? Where they were going to put the gas canisters that have enriched uranium?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: No, no, they did not inform that- that to us, but at the same time, there was no physical time, perhaps, to do it. Iran, for example, had announced to us that they had a new enrichment facility in Isfahan, and we were going to go on the 13th of June to- to check on that facility so that- and the site has been severely damaged and hit. So this is why I say it is indispensable. We will have to, aggravation or not, feelings and emotions or not, there has to come a point with- with cool heads. We sit around the table and- and see what- I mean, these protective measures, of course, it's their right to protect their assets, like any other sovereign nation. They can, of course, protect- but they know and there are, I don't want to get too technical or legalese here in this conversation, but there are provisions in the agreements we have, not only with Iran, with any- with any country. If a country at a- at a moment, feels that some of the things we inspect must be protected or whatever, they have to tell us, and we have to go, etc., etc., as you can imagine. So, this could not happen because of the unfolding of the circumstances, of a military conflict where, of course, you know, decisions are taken and this is not planned or announced, obviously. So now- now it's the time to reconnect and to talk and to talk to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, but there was roughly 400 kilograms, which is just under 900 pounds, of highly enriched uranium, before the attacks. I know these are in small canisters and relatively easy to move. Do you have any idea where that was moved, and if it was moved before the attack?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: We presume, and I think it's- it's logical to presume that when they announce that they are going to be taking protective measures, this could be part of it. But, as I said, we don't know where this material could be, or if part of it could have been, you know, under the attack during those 12 days. So some could have been destroyed as part of the attack, but some could have been moved. So there has to be at some point a clarification. If we don't get that clarification, this will continue to be hanging, you know, over our heads as- as a potential problem. So this is why I say it's so important, first of all, for Iran to allow our inspectors to continue their indispensable work as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you about what things might still remain, because there's that open question of could Iran sprint towards a bomb even now, if they wanted to. If we don't know where the highly enriched uranium is and cannot account for all the centrifuges, is that still a risk that they could be rushing towards a bomb?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, you know, I- we don't want to be alarmists here, and I don't want to be part of, you know, a messaging that would be spreading, as I say, alarm. But we need to be in a position to ascertain, to confirm what is there, and where is it and what happened. Iran had a very vast ambitious program, and part of it may still be there, and if not, there is also the self-evident truth that the knowledge is there. The industrial capacity is there. Iran is a very sophisticated country in terms of nuclear technology, as is obvious. So you cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have. It's a huge country, isn't it? So I think this should be the incentive that we all must have to understand that military operations or not, you are not going to solve this in a definitive way militarily. You are going to have an agreement. You are going to have an inspection system that will give everybody, everybody in the region and- and- and elsewhere, the assurances that we can- we can definitely turn the page.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until right before the strikes, the IAEA still had inspectors, as I understand it, going to some of these sites. There's been a lot of focus here in America on the trucks and satellite images of them outside of Fordo. What was happening in those days before the strike?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well, as- as you were pointing out there were- there was an announcement of protective measures that could have included moving equipment and material. We don't know. We saw the same images that the whole world has seen of these trucks, and we don't want to get into any rush conclusion about it, but it is, it is clear that we need the things that we ignore, okay. And after a reasonable period, after the war, there has to be a process that needs to continue. Otherwise the uncertainties will continue, will continue to linger on. And this is, you know, in a final analysis, not good, and perhaps even preventing a good agreement, because who is going to have an agreement where you don't know what the counterpart really has? What are the assets that they really have after the- after this- this- this military campaign that took place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So up until these strikes Iran- Iran was still disclosing information to the IAEA--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --Well yes, yes, yes, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-In certain amounts--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: There were deficits. There were deficits, and we were referring to those in the- in the sense that there were some things that they were not clarifying to us. But our inspection work was- was constant. In particular, in this sensitive area of the number of centrifuges and the amount of material, we had perfect view. We didn't have view on other things that we wanted to have. But on this one, it was- it was complete. It was comprehensive. And, of course, at the moment, there is- there is nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Iran wasn't keeping its stockpile of enriched uranium secret. The world was concerned--",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --You said you were concerned about it. What do you think it was intended for? And did you see anything that suggested they were looking to weaponize?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They- let me be clear here, because we said, first of all, something very, very important. They have all these capabilities, but for the agency, they- first of all, they didn't have nuclear weapons. Okay? This needs to be said. One can have an assessment nationally that they were close, okay? And I don't get into that, because we, the IAEA, does not judge intentions. The IAEA looks at the activities of a country and reports it to the world. So it is countries that- that say, well, this is of concern or not. What we were concerning- what- what I was concerned about is that there were other things that were not clear. For example, we had found traces of uranium in some places in Iran, which were not the normal declared facilities. And we were asking for years, why did we find these traces of enriched uranium in place x, y or z? And we were simply not getting credible answers. If there was material- where is this material? So there could be even more. We don't know. This is why it is, I'm sorry I'm repeating it for the third time, I think we need to go back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, understood. But your statement and that report that you gave about some of these open questions or unanswered questions, the Iranians are pointing to it now, and the foreign minister seems to be sort of blaming you for the military strikes. He said it wasn't honest and fair, your report. He said, after the facilities, you didn't even condemn the strikes- after the strikes, I should say. What do you make of those criticisms?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Well- I, to an extent, I understand. They have been under attack. But, really, who can believe that this conflict happened because of a report of the IAEA? And, by the way, what was- what was in that report was not new, Margaret. We have been saying that for a long time, and in previous reports as well. So, this- maybe it's because it's easier, maybe, to criticize an international organization or a director general, I don't know, but it's not reasonable to say that. And, if anything, the IAEA, as always, has had a very honest assessment of the situation. And there were many, I can assure you, there were many that- that were saying in your report, you must say that they have nuclear weapons, or they are very close to have nuclear weapons. And we didn't. We simply didn't, because this was not what we were seeing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you also said you couldn't verify that it was a peaceful program.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Absolutely, because we have to see everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: They did- we didn't see them. We didn't see a program that was aiming in that direction, but at the same time, they were not answering very, very important questions that were pending. So this is- this is the truth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I appreciate the nuance here, because there's so much gray. People here are looking for clarity, and there's confusion in the United States. CBS is reporting that the Defense Intelligence Agency assesses Iran's program was set back a few months, but once they dig out, they could resume in a number of months. They have to rebuild electrical and water supplies. The CIA and the National Intelligence directors say the facilities were destroyed, and it would take years to rebuild. Israel says the military program is set back many years. What's the truth here? What do you make of these assessments?",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: You know- you know what, this hourglass approach in weapons of mass destruction is- is not a good idea. Remember, we had cases 45 minutes and so on, which were quite- quite off spot. All of that depends on your metrics, Margaret. If you tell me it will take them two months or three months, for what?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there.",
      "Because, first of all, as I- and I think the intelligence- we are not there making any military evaluations, first of all, but, out of the logic of our conversation, it is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage, first of all. And secondly, Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again. This is again- and I'm sorry, fourth time, we have to go back to the table and have a technically sound solution to this. Otherwise, this will come hit us again, in terms of a situation which is not well clarified. And this is an opportunity. We do have an opportunity now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood, and we will see if that opportunity is picked up by either side. Director General, thank you for your time today.",
      "DIRECTOR GENERAL GROSSI: Thank you, as always, a pleasure. Thank you very much.",

      "Billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former TV journalist Lauren S\u00e1nchez got married in Venice, Italy, on Friday, with a star-studded celebrity guest list joining them for the festivities.",
      "S\u00e1nchez posted a photo of the couple on Instagram, showing herself in a fitted wedding dress with a long train, high neck and lace sleeves, and Bezos in a classic black tuxedo, as their guests clapped. She told\u00a0Vogue\u00a0the Dolce & Gabbana gown made her \"feel like a princess.\"",
      "Wedding location details were kept under wraps, but Italian newspapers and Venetian locals predicted it would take place at San Giorgio Maggiore, one of the Venetian islands, which is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore. Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests, and many were seen boarding water taxis to the island for Friday's festivities.",
      "This is the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S\u00e1nchez, 55. Bezos was previously married to\u00a0philanthropist Mackenzie Scott, but the pair divorced in 2019. S\u00e1nchez's first marriage to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of the talent firm Endeavor, also ended in 2019.",
      "Ahead of the nuptials, movie stars, TV personalities and business titans were sighted around Venice. Some were seen arriving on Thursday at the Madonna dell'Orto church for the first of several planned events. Some of the more recognizable names seen in photos include Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, the Kardashians and Jenners, Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Tom Brady, Bill Gates, Diane von Furstenberg, Usher, Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner.",
      "The influx of so much money and star power prompted protests from local Venetian residents, who launched the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign. It comes amid a\u00a0broader pushback against an overload of tourists across Europe, with some blaming the crowds of visitors for increased costs and rent.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 16:26:47 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers said their findings suggest husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage \u2013 suggesting a female dominance.",
    "story": [
      "An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a \"matriarchal society\" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published\u00a0in Science this week.",
      "Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a \"Mother Goddess\" cult and signs of a matriarchal society.",
      "A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building.",
      "During the early years in \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said.",
      "Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males.",
      "\"We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line \u2014 a matrilineal system,\" study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science,\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and\u00a0found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the\u00a0journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said upon the release of their findings, \"It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "The government told jurors during closing arguments that Diddy was \"the leader of a criminal enterprise.\"",
      "\"He doesn't take no for an answer,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christine Slavik told the court. \"And now you know about many crimes the defendant committed with members of his enterprise: kidnapping of one of the defendant's employees; arson by trying to blow up a car; forced labor, including of an employee the defendant repeatedly sexually assaulted; bribery of a security officer to keep damning evidence against the defendant buried; and of course, the brutal crimes at the heart of this case \u2014 sex trafficking.\"",

      "With closing arguments completed, Judge Arun Subramanian will hand down a detailed list of jury instructions, a detailed list with defining terms and elements of the law agreed upon by both parties to help guide jurors to reach a unanimous verdict.

      "Prince Harry and Prince William\u2019s relationship is said to be severely fractured \u2013 not because of the Duke of Sussex\u2019s royal exit, but due to the deafening silence from his brother.",
      "\"At this point, Harry\u2019s resentment towards William seems less about the Sussexes' actual exit in 2020 and more about what came after: the silence, the distance, and the sense that the family iced them out because they dared to speak up,\" royal commentator and podcast host Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"There simply has to be frustration that the family won't engage in good faith with the points that Harry has raised, even though he's done so publicly,\" Matta added.",

      "\"Harry left a large gap in William\u2019s world, not just personally but practically,\" the source told the outlet. \"The whole idea was for Harry to work hand-in-hand with William and to divide and conquer during William\u2019s monarchy.

      "\"Their lives and priorities have diverged dramatically since Harry decided to depart from royal duties. Harry is still harboring lingering resentment toward William, as evident in his comments. He has whined about both the estrangement and his sense of being unsupported, particularly regarding issues like security.\"",

      "\"As for whether William is jealous of Harry\u2019s freedom... if he is, he\u2019d never phrase it that way,\" said Matta. \"He\u2019s too rooted in the idea of his duty to openly admit wanting anything else. But you can see hints of that in how he\u2019s quietly carving out more space for his personal life, seizing more privacy for his wife and kids and taking more control over his platform. He may not want Harry\u2019s lifestyle, but he\u2019s taken note of what boundaries look like from his brother.\"",

      "However, the defense did find a way to show the jury a different explanation in an attempt to undermine the government's argument. \"Defense got an employee of one of the companies to say that Diddy was just buying the escorts' time and not any sexual performance, which the jury could use as a basis to acquit Diddy on the transportation charges,\" Faddis, a founding partner of Colorado-based Varner Faddis, said.",

      "The jury is unlikely to find Diddy not guilty of racketeering, criminal defense attorney John W. Day told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The only thing Diddy and his team can hope for is a miracle where the jurors don't buy the government's claim that this was racketeering and that Diddy was the head of a criminal empire dedicated to fulfilling his desires,\" the founder of New Mexico-based law practice, John Day Law, explained. \"A defense win is more likely if the jurors are conflicted on the racketeering charges and can't reach a unanimous verdict. That could lead to a hung jury on one or more of the charges. But the jurors spent the entire trial waiting to see how Diddy's lawyers rebutted the massive case against him, and they merely rested without putting on any witnesses. That leaves the jury picking through the government's case to see if this really rises to racketeering, and if not, they may hang or acquit on some of the charges \u2013 but it's unlikely.\"",

      "\"The prosecution can withstand an acquittal or a hung jury on some of the counts, but the prosecutors really need a conviction for racketeering to claim total victory,\" Day added. \"Again, that can be a difficult charge to convict on if the jurors don't buy the theory that this entire business empire was engaged in sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. But the defense needed to have convinced at least one juror that the case wasn't there, and that witnesses were lying to save their own necks. And that's a tough sell to a jury that spent weeks listening to horrific testimony about Diddy and his empire.\"",

      "\"I\u2019m a family physician, and on a regular basis, we\u2019re faced with patients who have diabetes, heart disease, obesity and other conditions that are related to obesity,\" Orlando said in a press release for the study.",

      "\"One of the routine measures we take alongside traditional vital signs is BMI. We use BMI to screen for a person having an issue with their body composition, but it\u2019s not as accurate for everyone as vital signs are,\" he added.",
      "BMI has been the international standard for measuring obesity since the 1980s, according to many sources, though some experts have questioned its validity.",

      "An individual is considered obese if their BMI is 30 or above, overweight if it is between 25 and 29.9, of \"normal\" weight in the range of 18.5 to 24.9, or underweight if lower than 18.5.",
      "While BMI is easy to calculate, one of its main limitations is that it cannot distinguish between muscle and fat mass, the researchers noted.",
      "\"People who are bodybuilders can really elevate their body mass index,\" one doctor said. \"But they\u2019re healthy even with a BMI indicating that they\u2019re obese.\" (iStock)",

      "EXPERIMENTAL DRUG HELPS PATIENTS LOSE NEARLY A QUARTER OF BODY WEIGHT IN EARLY TRIALS",
      "Other methods, such as a DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan, may be even more accurate than BIA, but are much more expensive and not as accessible, the researchers noted.",
      "\"If you talk to obesity researchers, they\u2019re going to say you have to use the DEXA scan because it\u2019s the most accurate,\" Mainous said in the release. \"And that\u2019s probably true. But it\u2019s never going to be viable in a doctor\u2019s office or family practice.\"",

      "Potential limitations",
      "\"The main strengths of this study are a better correlation to an individual's risk of morbidity and mortality \u2014 however, the limitations lie in the fact that we don't have enough data to determine the right cutoff for these numbers, or to identify the right tools that will be both accurate and precise across the population,\" Vogel said.",
      "The researchers also acknowledged that body fat percentage thresholds haven\u2019t yet been as standardized as BMI and waist circumference.",

      "Also, the age range of the participants in the study was limited by the data source.",

      "\"These data will drive better discussions in the doctor\u2019s office, as well as public health initiatives with the goal of improving the health of all,\" a doctor said. (iStock)",
      "The study was also limited by focusing only on mortality as an outcome, they noted, without taking into account any developing diseases \u2014 such as heart failure or cancer \u2014 that could deepen the understanding of body fat as a risk factor.",
      "The goal, according to Vogel, is to have a cost-effective, consistent method that can be used across the population with reliable accuracy.",
      "\"These data will drive better discussions in the doctor\u2019s office, as well as public health initiatives with the goal of improving the health of all.\"",
      "\"Benefits would come in the form of a more detailed list of information that helps providers and patients make informed decisions about the patient\u2019s health, which is ideal,\" Vogel noted.",

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani last week, could also be on the ticket in November.",
      "But Sliwa, a lifelong New Yorker and founder of the Guardian Angels crime-prevention group, insisted to Fox News Digital that he is the man for the job. He also spoke about his fractured relationship with President Donald Trump and said he would welcome the president\u2019s endorsement, should it come.",

The Brooklyn-born 71-year-old famously survived a mob hit in 1992 in which he was shot multiple times inside a moving taxi before jumping out through a window.",
      "\"The only way you get me out of this race before Nov. 4 is in a coffin, in a pine box,\" he said. \"And people know the Gottis and Gambinos tried that in 1992, and it didn't work and this won't work either. Be prepared to see Curtis Sliwa on the Republican line on Nov. 4.\"",
      "Sliwa has led the Guardian Angels since 1979 and said what separates him from the field is simple: He rides the subways, talks to the people and knows the neighborhoods by heart.",

None of these other guys are in the system. I live there.\"",
      "Political experts consider Sliwa\u2019s election bid as a long shot. He ran against Adams in the 2021 election and lost by 66.1% to 27.4%. But the chips could finally fall Sliwa\u2019s way in November if the left and center vote splits \u2013 with voters balking at Mamdani\u2019s far-left agenda and both Adams and former Cuomo siphoning off Democratic votes with Independent runs.",

      "Adams\u2019 spokesperson, Kayla Mamelak Altus, blasted Sliwa\u2019s characterization of the mayor, telling Fox News Digital Sliwa is becoming \"more detached from reality every day and nothing he ever says should be taken seriously.\"",
      "In the interview, Sliwa also took aim at Mamdani\u2019s socialist policies, which include a citywide rent freeze, free public bus service and higher property taxes on wealthy neighborhoods \u2013 all ideas that critics say have already strained budgets and backfired in Chicago under Mayor Brandon Johnson.",
      "\"Just go to Chicago and see the results of what a socialist mayor will not be able to do for you,\" Sliwa said. \"There\u2019s a lot of promise, but there\u2019s no delivery.\" Mamdani\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sliwa said his campaign is focused on public safety and housing affordability, embracing the slogan \"improve, don\u2019t move,\" which taps into disgruntled voters who may seek to join the exodus of people fleeing the city in recent years.",
      "He also thinks his no-kill policy for the city\u2019s animal shelters will bring in moderate Democrats, women voters, younger generations and animal advocates who might not typically support a Republican candidate. Sliwa is known for his deep love of cats, often highlighting his devotion to rescuing and caring for strays.",
      "Sliwa scoffed at the notion that Mamdani\u2019s social media influence could be a deciding factor, arguing the race will be won by connecting with people on the ground. The assemblyman has nearly 2 million followers on Instagram, compared to Sliwa\u2019s 66,000, while the socialist candidate has more than 910,000 followers on TikTok compared to Sliwa\u2019s 183,000.",

That just pushes them into Mamdani\u2019s camp.\"",
      "A Trump endorsement could also shift momentum in Sliwa\u2019s favor. Though he called his relationship with the president a \"love-hate\" one, Trump\u2019s rallies in the Bronx and at Madison Square Garden last year suggest a shifting political tide in the city \u2013 and a joint appearance with Sliwa could prove a game-changer.",
      "\"I don't talk to President Trump on the phone. I haven't been to Mar-a-Lago or gone to Washington,\" Sliwa said. \"He seems to talk to Eric Adams. Look, he saved him from going to prison, I understand that. In the last election, I voted for him and I encouraged people to vote for him.\"",
      "But Sliwa said he is open to receiving Trump\u2019s backing, even if the race is not on the president\u2019s radar.",
      "\"Well, if it comes, that's fine. If it doesn't come, remember I ran the last time, I was not endorsed by President Trump,\" Sliwa said. \"[Trump] did not endorse Eric Adams. He basically stayed out of the race. He's got enough issues to deal with \u2013 Ukraine, Russia, Iran, obviously his beautiful bill and everything else that he's got on his plate that has geopolitical significance.

That's exactly what's happening at VenHub, a fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store that just opened at the LAX/Metro Transit Center in Los Angeles. Even if you haven't seen one in person yet, VenHub's cutting-edge tech is set to shake up how people shop all across the country.",

      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "What Is VenHub? The next evolution of the smart store",
      "Open 24/7 and installable in under a week,\u00a0VenHub is designed for high-traffic environments, such as transit centers, airports, and city hubs, where speed, security, and efficiency are in high demand. Instead of relying on cashiers or attendants, VenHub uses two industrial robotic arms, named Barb and Peter, to handle all product selection and delivery. The process is simple yet futuristic.",
      "Customers place their orders through the VenHub app, pay digitally, and receive a QR code. Upon arrival at the store, the customer scans the code at a secure pickup window. One of the robotic arms then retrieves the items from storage and delivers them to the window within about 90 seconds. The entire transaction is seamless, contactless, and designed to eliminate the frustrations of traditional vending machines or checkout lines.",
      "A fully autonomous, AI-powered smart store. (VenHub)",
      "AI HUMANOID ROBOT IS CHANGING THE WAY YOU BUY CARS AT DEALERSHIPS",
      "The technology powering VenHub",
      "VenHub's foundation is a sophisticated blend of robotics, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics. The robotic arms are similar to those used in automotive manufacturing, engineered for speed, precision, and reliability. Rather than attempting to mimic human appearance, these arms are optimized for repetitive, high-accuracy tasks that are perfect for retail fulfillment.",
      "Artificial intelligence drives every aspect of store operations. AI algorithms manage inventory by tracking purchasing patterns, adjusting stock levels, and predicting demand based on time of day, location, and customer behavior. Machine vision allows the robots to accurately identify products and handle them with minimal errors or downtime. The entire system is connected through IoT sensors, providing real-time data on inventory, system health, and order status. This data-driven approach enables VenHub to operate efficiently, minimize waste, and ensure popular items are always available.",
      "From the customer's perspective, everything is managed through a mobile app. This app handles payment, order tracking, and pickup notifications, creating a frictionless and transparent shopping experience. On the backend, analytics continually refine operations, making each store smarter over time.",

      "AI ROBOTS HELP NURSES BEAT BURNOUT AND TRANSFORM HOSPITAL CARE",
      "Why VenHub's model could change retail nationwide",
      "VenHub's model offers significant advantages that could reshape retail across the country. The rapid setup time enables these stores to quickly appear in busy locations, ranging from transportation hubs to college campuses and urban centers. Since the store operates around the clock without breaks, it maximizes both convenience for shoppers and revenue for operators. Eliminating on-site staff dramatically reduces overhead, allowing for competitive pricing and improved profitability.",
      "Security is a major focus for VenHub. The store uses bulletproof glass to protect inventory and customers. If one robot requires maintenance, the other can take over, ensuring reliable service with minimal downtime. VenHub's design is also environmentally conscious, featuring compact, energy-efficient layouts and optional solar power compatibility to reduce its carbon footprint. Each store can be customized to fit local demand, whether that means stocking snacks, electronics, or other essentials.",

      "A common concern with automation is the impact on jobs. VenHub's robots do replace some traditional retail roles, but the company emphasizes that new opportunities are emerging. Skilled workers are needed to maintain, restock, and support the automated systems, shifting the workforce toward higher-paying, tech-focused positions. This trend reflects a broader shift in the economy, where automation often transforms jobs rather than eliminating them.",

      "If you're considering bringing a VenHub Smart Store to your city, here's a quick breakdown of the costs and what's included. The price for a VenHub Smart Store ranges from $250,000 to $275,000, depending on your chosen configuration. To secure your spot in the production queue, you'll need a $2,500 pre-order deposit, which is fully refundable up until production begins. Financing is available through select financial institutions, with some buyers qualifying for up to 100% financing. However, all arrangements are handled directly between you and the lender; VenHub does not influence approval decisions.",
      "Once you own a VenHub Smart Store, it's yours outright; there are no leases or franchise agreements. You have complete control over pricing, inventory, and restocking, and you can manage replenishment yourself or use VenHub's preferred fulfillment partners. A monthly software-as-a-service fee of $2,500 covers software updates, AI analytics, remote monitoring, and cloud-based management tools. If you require additional support, an optional maintenance package is available for $1,300 per month, which includes servicing and preventive care.",
      "VenHub does not secure locations for you, but they do offer guidance on choosing high-traffic spots, such as shopping centers, universities, business districts, or commuter hubs, to help maximize your store's performance.

      "Shanghai is no stranger to jaw-dropping feats of engineering.",
      "In the latest example, a Shanghai historic building moved by robots is capturing global attention. The relocation of the complex in Huayang, a Shikumen-style building weighing about 7,500 metric tons (approximately 8,267 U.S. tons) and covering roughly 43,400 square feet, is truly rewriting the rules.",
      "This ambitious project is powered by an army of 432 small robots that are moving the massive structure about 33 feet each day to make way for a new underground development. Let's dive into how this is happening, why it matters and what it means for the future of urban preservation.",

      "Over 400 small robots are moving the complex in Huayang. (Shanghai Government)",
      "What makes the Shanghai historic building moved by robots so special?",
      "The Huayanli complex is a set of three brick-and-wood buildings constructed between the 1920s and 1930s. Located in the heart of Shanghai's historic Zhangyuan area, these structures are classic examples of shikumen architecture, which is a unique blend of Western and Chinese design. Zhangyuan itself is over 140 years old and is one of Shanghai's largest and best-preserved shikumen neighborhoods.",

      "Why is a Shanghai historic building being moved by robots?",
      "The relocation is not just for show. The city is building a three-story underground center beneath the complex that will include over 570,000 square feet of cultural and commercial space, a parking garage with more than 100 spots and a transportation hub that will connect three major subway lines. By preserving the historic Huayanli complex above ground while adding modern infrastructure below, Shanghai is finding a smart balance between honoring its heritage and embracing progress.",

      "Moving a building of this size is tough enough, but the challenge is multiplied by Zhangyuan's dense web of narrow alleys and closely packed historic buildings. Traditional relocation methods simply would not fit. The area's historic significance also means that any mistake could damage irreplaceable architecture, including the 1928 \"great hall\" that once housed a patriotic night school.",

      "Instead of using cranes or bulldozers, engineers put 432 small walking robots to work. These robots gently lift the building and slowly move it forward, inch by inch, covering about 33 feet each day. To achieve this incredible level of precision, the project relies on several advanced technologies. Special low-clearance drilling robots, which can be operated remotely, navigate tight corridors and doorways to create new foundations beneath the historic structure.",
      "Earth-moving robots equipped with folding mechanical arms, just under four feet wide, use artificial intelligence to tell the difference between clay and solid obstacles. Engineers also use building information modeling and point cloud scanning to create highly detailed 3D blueprints. These digital models help the team plan exact movement routes, avoid potential collisions and design curved paths for removing soil.",
      "To keep the construction site efficient and minimize disruption, soil is carried out using a conveyor belt system, much like an assembly line. The move is only temporary. Once the underground construction is finished, the Huayanli complex will be carefully returned to its original spot, fully restored and preserved, now sitting atop a modern underground facility.",

When third-party vendors handle patient data, the security of that data becomes dependent on their infrastructure.",
      "Healthcare data is among the most valuable types of personal information for hackers. Unlike payment card data, which can be changed quickly, medical and identity records are long-term assets on the dark web. These breaches can lead to insurance fraud, identity theft and even blackmail.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.",
      "These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "What makes this breach especially alarming is that many of the affected patients may have never even heard of Episource. As a business-to-business vendor, Episource operates in the background, working with insurers and healthcare providers, not with patients directly. The people affected were customers of those companies, yet it's their most sensitive data now at risk because of a third party they never chose or trusted. This kind of indirect relationship muddies the waters when it comes to responsibility and makes it even harder to demand transparency or hold anyone accountable.",

They\u2019re laughably bad. But this scam flips the script because it uses PayPal against you. Here's how the scam operates:",
      "Exploiting real features:\u00a0Scammers abuse PayPal\u2019s \"add address\" or \"money request\" tools. By entering your email, they can trigger real emails from PayPal\u2019s real domain. And this works even if you don\u2019t have a PayPal account.",
      "Bypassing filters: Because these emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s servers (service@paypal.com), they pass all security checks and appear legitimate in your inbox.",
      "Lack of suspicion: Some versions contain no phishing links at all, just a scammer\u2019s phone number, making them even harder to detect.",
      "Panic bait: The message often claims a new address was added, or a large payment is being processed, getting your attention and provoking a quick reaction.",
      "Follow-up attacks: After the initial email, scammers may later contact you pretending to be PayPal support. Some urge you to click a link to \"secure your account\", which leads to a fake login page designed to steal your credentials.",
      "THE DARK SIDE OF PAYPAL AND HOW TO STAY SAFE",
      "Real examples of the PayPal phishing scam in action",
      "This scam has been reported by dozens of users on Reddit and cybersecurity forums. One Reddit user posted a detailed thread in r/Scams showing screenshots of phishing emails that look like they came straight from PayPal\u2019s official address.",
      "Phishing email sent from\u00a0service@paypal.com (Reddit)",
      "In a newer and more sophisticated twist, scammers are removing links altogether. Instead, they include a phone number and ask you to call. Once you do, you\u2019re connected with a fake PayPal representative who says they need to verify your identity. They then instruct you to download what appears to be a PayPal-branded support tool, but really it\u2019s a customized remote access app hosted on a different server. And once it\u2019s installed, it gives the scammer full access to your device.",

      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "How scammers are hijacking PayPal\u2019s system to send fake alerts",
      "This part is still a bit of a mystery. With typical PayPal invoice scams, content is tightly controlled, which means you normally can\u2019t change the email structure or messaging. However, these new emails suggest that scammers may be exploiting internal features, like business tools or API fields, to sneak custom content into PayPal-generated alerts. It\u2019s not just phishing, it\u2019s weaponizing a legitimate system to create trust and evade detection.",
      "Why this PayPal phishing attack is so dangerous",
      "This scam is especially effective and dangerous because the emails come directly from PayPal\u2019s official servers, making it difficult to distinguish them from legitimate messages. Since the sender address and branding are authentic, recipients are more likely to trust the communication without suspicion.",
      "The scammers also use urgent language that creates a sense of panic, such as warnings about unauthorized activity or large charges. This pressure encourages people to act quickly and often before fully considering whether the alert is genuine.",
      "Additionally, the scam often involves follow-up contact through calls or texts from individuals posing as PayPal personnel, further exploiting the initial confusion and increasing the chances of victims giving up sensitive information.",

      "1. Don\u2019t click links in suspicious emails, even if they look real, and use strong antivirus software. If you receive a PayPal alert you didn\u2019t expect, go to PayPal by typing paypal.com into your browser or using the official app. Never click links or dial phone numbers provided in the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Adding 2FA to your PayPal and email accounts gives you a second layer of defense even if your password gets compromised.",
      "3. Use a password manager:\u00a0Using a password manager is the best way to ensure every login you use has a unique, strong password. No repeats means no chain reaction if one site gets hacked. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4. Check your account manually: If you\u2019re ever in doubt, just log into your PayPal account directly. Review\u00a0recent activity and see if anything looks off. There is no need to rely on alerts alone.",
      "5. Report the scam:\u00a0Forward suspicious PayPal messages to phishing@paypal.com. You can also\u00a0report phishing attempts to the FTC.",
      "6. Use a personal data removal service: Since phishing scams like the recent PayPal scam often target personal information that scammers gather from data brokers and people search sites, using a reputable data removal service can help reduce your exposure. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This phishing scam is dangerous because it uses real PayPal emails sent from service@paypal.com. Scammers exploit PayPal\u2019s built-in features to send real notifications that look legitimate. What makes it especially sneaky is the absence of links, Instead, these emails include a phone number, making them more likely to pass through spam filters. When you call, you\u2019re connected to a fake PayPal rep who pressures you into downloading a remote access tool disguised as support software. The safest move? Don\u2019t click, don\u2019t call. Just go straight to PayPal.com and check your account manually.",

That moisture is then heated to kill any microbes, and it passes through a dual-stage UV sterilization system and a carbon filter to remove impurities, bacteria and particles.",
      "Once the water is purified, the Kara Pod adds essential minerals like calcium, magnesium and sodium. This turns into healthy, mineral-rich water that is ready to drink or brew with. The device can make up to 3.2 liters, which is about a gallon, of premium alkaline water every day.

    "summary": "A Facebook scammer posing as Elon Musk tricked a victim with promises of a Tesla and $250,000, requesting gift cards that become untraceable once the codes are shared.",
    "story": [
      "Watch out for this Zelle scam on facebook marketplace. Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson explains why.",
      "It started with a Facebook friend request and a message that felt too good to be true.",
      "Then,\u00a0it quickly turned into an expensive lesson in online deception.",
      "The woman this happened to in Jensen Beach, Florida, wrote us saying, \"He kept telling me it was my lucky day. I had just won a new white Tesla and $250,000 in cash. All I needed to do was send him an Apple Gift Card for $200. So I did. Well, $800 later, he wanted more to pay for the broken-down truck that was on its way to my house to deliver my winnings.\"",
      "The scammer, posing as Elon Musk, used flattery, fake urgency and a convincing profile to lure the victim into a carefully staged hoax. Behind the big promises was someone who walked away with hundreds of dollars in untraceable gift cards. Here\u2019s how the scam works and how you can avoid falling for it.",

      "A CLOSE CALL WITH A FACEBOOK SCAM THAT TRIED TO STEAL CREDIT CARD INFO",
      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account. But unfortunately, by then, the funds were already gone.",

      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES AND AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Why scammers prefer gift cards in online scams",
      "Gift cards are one of the most common tools used in scams because they are fast, anonymous, and nearly impossible to recover once the code is shared. Scammers often claim that the cards are needed to cover fees, unlock a prize or verify your identity. Once a scammer has the code, they can do a few things:",

      "Sell the card on online marketplaces at a discount",
      "Launder the funds through reselling sites or gaming platforms.",
      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

      "Other Elon Musk impersonation scams to know about",
      "Scams that impersonate celebrities or public figures have become increasingly common. Criminals use well-known names to create a false sense of trust and urgency. Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate. Some of the most common Elon-related scams include:",
      "Energy-saving device scams: One scam used Musk\u2019s photo and fake testimonials to promote a suspicious energy product through Facebook ads. The ad was styled to look like a real news article, which made it harder to spot as a fake.\u00a0Read more about the energy-saving scam here.Fake investment opportunities: In one case, a scammer convinced a woman she was in a relationship with Musk and persuaded her to invest in a business venture. She lost over $26,000 before realizing it was a hoax.Crypto giveaway livestreams: These scams often appear on YouTube or in ads, claiming that Musk is hosting a giveaway. Victims are told to send cryptocurrency with the promise of getting double in return. In reality, the money is taken and never returned.",

      "What ties these scams together is the use of a familiar face to lower suspicion. The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins. Victims are asked to send money, act quickly and avoid telling anyone. If a message or ad involves a celebrity offering free money, discounted products or special access to a private opportunity, it is almost certainly a scam.",

      "These scams rely on quick decisions, emotional reactions and a false sense of trust. Slowing down and checking for warning signs can help you stay safe. Here are some practical steps:",
      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

In one case, a reader lost $800 after being promised a Tesla and $250,000 in cash, but only if they sent Apple Gift Cards first. These scams rely on trust, speed and celebrity recognition.

      "But that doesn't mean all this data is safe. If you've ever received a spam call, phishing email or a fake support call, your personal data is out there.",
      "And if you want proof of how poorly your data is treated, a newly uncovered database offers a stark reminder. More than 16 billion login credentials, collected from years of past data breaches, have been compiled into one of the largest aggregated archives of cybersecurity incidents ever seen, according to a report.",

      "Cybernews describes the exposed database as a \"blueprint for mass exploitation.\" The records include login credentials from popular platforms like Google, Facebook and Apple.",
      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",
      "BleepingComputer, a cybersecurity site that reviewed the archive, confirmed the data appears to be aggregated from older breaches rather than a fresh incident. This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",
      "Credential stuffing becomes much easier when attackers have access to such a vast pool of usernames and passwords. This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials. So, even if your account wasn't part of a recent breach, you could still be at risk if your old credentials are part of this newly indexed compilation.",

      "With credential leaks becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Passwords are no longer enough. That is why I have always believed tech companies should phase them out entirely and require two-factor authentication across the board. Passwords, once the foundation of online identity, are now one of its weakest links. Companies like Google and Meta are already building systems that move beyond them. The tools are available. The message is clear. You do not need to wait for a breach to start taking security seriously.",

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

      "Why Plus is grabbing attention in the trucking world",
      "Trucking is a $2 trillion freight market in the U.S. and Europe alone, and it faces some serious headwinds. There is a growing shortage of drivers, rising costs, and relentless demand for faster deliveries. Plus's SuperDrive software is designed to address these pain points by enabling safe, scalable autonomous trucking. The technology is not just theoretical. It has already been tested over five million miles across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, gathering real-world data to make its AI smarter and more reliable with every trip.",
      "Founded in Silicon Valley in 2016 by engineers and entrepreneurs with deep roots in AI and machine learning, Plus has always aimed to do things differently. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, Plus uses advanced AI models to create a \"driving intelligence\" that learns and adapts from every mile on the road. This AV 2.0 approach helped Plus achieve a major safety milestone in April 2025, when its SuperDrive system successfully completed \"driver-out\" validation. The truck operated autonomously without a human behind the wheel. Plus is currently running public road tests in Texas and Sweden, with more fleet trials coming soon.",

      "The upcoming merger with Churchill Capital Corp IX is expected to provide Plus with up to $300 million in gross proceeds. This capital will help fund the commercial launch of SuperDrive-enabled, factory-built autonomous trucks in 2027. Plus is entering the public market with a pre-money valuation of $1.2 billion, offering an attractive opportunity for investors interested in the next wave of AI-driven logistics.",
      "What sets Plus apart financially is its capital-light, software-focused model. Instead of building trucks from scratch, Plus provides the AI \"brain\" that powers them, generating recurring revenue through a driver-as-a-service approach. This means high margins, scalable growth, and a clear path to profitability. The company is led by a team of experienced founders and executives, including CEO David Liu, who has a proven track record of building and scaling technology startups. Liu underscores the company\u2019s broader mission, stating:",

      "Not everyone is onboard: Skepticism and industry pushback",
      "While Plus Automation's vision is ambitious, it is not without critics. The autonomous trucking industry continues to face scrutiny from regulators, labor unions, and some logistics professionals who question whether the technology is truly ready for wide-scale deployment.",
      "Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like\u00a0Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",
      "As Plus prepares to go public, how it addresses these concerns from regulators, workers, and industry stakeholders will be critical. Earning trust may prove just as important as advancing the technology itself.",

      "According to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The\u00a0Trucker Media Group:",
      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

      "The Forerunner K2 stands out for its precision, endurance, and adaptability. With advanced manipulators and flexible sensors, the robot can handle delicate and complex tasks that require a human-like touch. Its eight-hour battery life supports continuous operation during long industrial shifts, and its learning algorithms enable it to adapt to new tasks and environments with minimal retraining.",
      "Kepler also emphasizes the cost efficiency of the K2, stating that it can match or exceed the workload of multiple human workers in certain scenarios, making it a practical addition to high-demand workplaces. The company has set the base price for the Forerunner K2 at around $30,000, positioning it as an accessible option for manufacturers seeking to boost productivity and efficiency with intelligent robotics.",
      "Forerunner K2 \"Bumblebee\" humanoid robot at the SAIC-GM automotive plant. (Kepler Robotics)",
      "Addressing concerns about job displacement",
      "The introduction of advanced humanoid robots like Kepler's K2 naturally raises questions about the future of human employment in manufacturing and other industries. It's true that automation and robotics have the potential to change the way work is organized on the factory floor. Some worry that robots could replace jobs traditionally held by people, especially in roles that involve repetitive or physically demanding tasks.",
      "However, experts and industry leaders point out that the story is more nuanced. While certain jobs may be automated, new opportunities often emerge alongside technological advancements. For example, the rise of robotics is expected to create roles in robot maintenance, programming, AI training, and oversight, jobs that require different skills but are essential to supporting and managing these new systems. Many analysts believe that robots like the K2 are likely to complement human workers by taking over monotonous or hazardous duties, which allows people to focus on more complex, creative, or supervisory tasks.",
      "Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" are specifically designed to work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety rather than simply replacing labor. This collaborative approach can lead to new forms of teamwork and innovation on the factory floor, making work environments safer and more efficient. Ultimately, the integration of humanoid robots is expected to shift the workforce rather than eliminate it, opening up new possibilities for both businesses and employees as they adapt to a more automated future.",

      "Kepler's K2 humanoid robot making its debut at SAIC-GM is a big step forward for robotics in real-world workplaces. Watching these robots take on challenging tasks alongside people shows just how much potential there is for collaboration between humans and machines. As more companies explore what humanoid robots can do, it's going to be fascinating to see how these partnerships shape the future of work and industry.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday took up a new challenge to campaign finance restrictions in a case brought by Republicans seeking to overturn limits on party committees spending money in coordination with individual candidates.",
      "It is the latest in a long-running sequence of cases that have eroded campaign finance restrictions since Congress sought to strictly limit them in the 1970s.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has long been skeptical of campaign finance restrictions on free speech grounds, with its most notable ruling being the 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision that paved the way for unlimited independent expenditures by outside groups.",
      "However, in a 2001 ruling, the court upheld the restrictions at issue in the new case, meaning the justices would have to overturn that decision for the Republicans to win. The court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in its next term, which begins in October.",
      "The challenge was brought by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the campaigns of two candidates in the 2022 elections: now-Vice President JD Vance, who was running as a Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio, and former Rep. Steve Chabot, a Republican congressman from the same state who lost his re-election bid.",
      "The Federal Election Commission, under the direction of the Trump administration, has sided with the challengers, saying it agrees the restrictions violate the Constitution's First Amendment.",
      "The restrictions, first imposed via the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, will now be defended by the Democratic National Committee and associated committees, which filed a motion to intervene in the case.",
      "The case does not involve other campaign restrictions, such as limits on how much individuals can donate to a candidate or party.",
      "Under current law, amended over the years by the Supreme Court and Congress, parties can make unlimited independent expenditures in support of a candidate but cannot exceed limits on coordinated spending.",
      "This can include such spending as hiring a venue or fundraising consultants, or paying for a candidate's travel, the Republicans said in court papers.",
      "The current limit varies based on voting-age population in a specific House of Representatives or Senate election, but it can be as much as almost $4 million for Senate races and $127,000 for at-large House seats.",
      "With the flood of spending that resulted from the Citizens United ruling, giving rise to the creation of independent \"super PACs\"  to funnel unlimited money into elections, the existing caps have had increasingly little effect in addressing the original intent of keeping money out of politics to avoid corruption or the appearance of it.",
      "\u201cThe court\u2019s reasoning upholding these party spending limits has been undermined by more recent court campaign finance cases,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA School of Law.",
      "\u201cThe status quo \u2014 where outside groups like super PACs can raise unlimited sums but political parties face much more severe limitations \u2014 may create worse conditions in terms of empowering unaccountable groups and increasing negative ads,\u201d he added."

    "summary": "A forensic pension investigator was hired to provide clarity on CalPERS investments, the high fees it's paying to Wall Street firms and its lagging performance.",
    "story": [
      "In recent years, the handling of the nation\u2019s largest public pension fund has caused growing alarm among a group of retirees who rely on it.",
      "They have sought an outside audit of California\u2019s $530 billion pension fund, known as the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, or CalPERS. They have also tried to persuade legislators to install an inspector general to monitor its operations.",
      "Both efforts went nowhere. Now, they\u2019ve decided to take matters into their own hands.",
      "The retired public employees are taking the unusual step of hiring a forensic pension investigator to provide clarity on the fund\u2019s investments, the high fees it is paying to big Wall Street firms and its lagging performance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to take this on, on our own,\u201d said Margaret Brown, a former CalPERS board member who is now president of the Retired Public Employees\u2019 Association of California, a nonprofit advocacy group with roughly 22,000 members.",
      "Retirement anxiety is a nationwide worry, of course, and it looms large for CalPERS\u2019 2.3 million members. CalPERS\u2019 obligations to beneficiaries are only 75% funded, its latest financial statements show, below the national average of 83.1%, according to the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems.",
      "CalPERS\u2019 investments have lagged behind other pensions\u2019 \u2014 its portfolio of stocks, bonds, real estate and private equity returned 6.6% on average in each of the past five years, against the average public fund\u2019s gain of 7.15%, according to NCPERS. Last year was a bit better, with CalPERS up 9.3% versus the average public pension fund return of 9.47%. Still, CalPERS\u2019 one-year gain lagged behind its benchmark return of 10.3%.",
      "Although publicly traded stocks have been among CalPERS\u2019 best performing assets of late, the fund has increased its exposure to costly and opaque private investments, including private equity.",
      "The most recent annual financial report shows CalPERS had 15.6% of its portfolio in private equity, up from its previous target weight of 10% in 2023. Measured over one-year, five-year, 10-year and 20-year periods, CalPERS\u2019 private equity has underperformed its benchmark in three of those time frames, its records show.",
      "Meanwhile, other large institutional investors are dumping private equity investments as their performance wanes. In a February report about pension funds in general, S&P Global analysts characterized increasing exposure to private equity as problematic for pensions \u201csince these investments often have opaque and variable disclosures and increasing fees, meaning that risk versus return might be hard to measure.\u201d",
      "Large state pension funds\u2019 exposure to private equity and limited transparency has also prompted concerns in other parts of the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota.",
      "Brown, who was on the CalPERS board from 2018 through 2022, spent her career at Garden Grove Unified School District and was responsible for the district\u2019s planning, funding and construction of large-scale capital projects.",
      "\u201cOur members who are paying attention to what\u2019s going on at CalPERS are concerned about the investment decisions and the 75% funding,\u201d she said.",
      "The fund\u2019s decision to plow more money into private equity as other savvy investors are reducing their holdings is a major worry, she said.",
      "\u201cDoes anyone honestly believe that CalPERS knows more than the major investors around the world?\u201d Brown asked. \u201cOr is CalPERS simply betting that private equity will save the pension fund and bolster returns? I believe the latter.\u201d",
      "J.J. Jelincic, another ex-CalPERS board member who is now director of health benefits at the Retired Public Employees\u2019 Association, is especially concerned about a lack of transparency in the pension fund\u2019s operations.",
      "\u201cThey are getting more and more secretive, and that clearly is upsetting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting harder and harder to know what they\u2019re up to.\u201d",
      "James Scullary, a CalPERS spokesman, declined to comment on the new investigation. As for the pension fund\u2019s higher allocations to private equity, he said the investments have outperformed all its other asset classes over the past 20 years, generating a 12% annualized return.",
      "Still, that return failed to meet the benchmark CalPERS used for the asset class in the period.",
      "As for the CalPERS\u2019 75% funding status, Scullary said it is well-prepared to provide payments to pension beneficiaries \u201cfor years to come.\u201d CalPERS, he added, \u201cis unwavering in its commitment to serving the best interests of its members, ensuring their financial security and well-being both now and in the future.\u201d",
      "Brown and Jelincic said they intend to raise the money to pay for the CalPERS analysis from members of the retired employees association and anyone else with an interest in holding the fund to account.",
      "They plan to hire their own forensic pension investigator \u2014 Edward Siedle, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney \u2014 because their previous efforts to monitor the fund\u2019s operations failed.",
      "These included unsuccessful attempts to get state legislators to order an audit of the fund and to require the creation of an inspector general to oversee it, Brown said.",
      "Siedle\u2019s task won\u2019t be easy. He has faced opposition to his work at other pensions and said he expects a similar response from CalPERS.",
      "Other large public pensions have inspectors general monitoring their activities. In 2008, after a pay-to-play scandal involving the New York State Common Retirement Fund, New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli established the Office of the Inspector General \u201cto prevent, detect and deter corruption, fraud, criminal activity, conflicts of interest and abuse within the Office and within the NYS Common Retirement Fund.\u201d",
      "Scullary, of CalPERS, said oversight of the fund\u2019s operation comes from its independent auditor and 13-member board. But Jelincic said when he requested copies of internal audits, he was advised that some are exempt from disclosure, so the auditor\u2019s oversight is difficult to assess. Past reasons for denying access to audits include claims of attorney-client privilege and proprietary information in private equity documents.",
      "At Scullary\u2019s suggestion, NBC News raised Brown\u2019s and Jelincic\u2019s concerns with Rocco Paternoster, executive director of California State Retirees, a 44,000-member advocacy group advocating for retired state employees on their pension and health benefits. Paternoster characterized Brown and Jelincic as disgruntled former CalPERS board members and said that while his members would like the funding level to be higher than the current 75%, it \u201cis not something we\u2019re panicked about.\u201d",
      "Asked about CalPERS\u2019 increased commitments to costly private equity partnerships, Paternoster said, \u201cWe believe you need to incentivize people to work hard on your behalf. Commissions and fees are not a concern for us.\u201d",
      "CalPERS records show it paid private equity managers $569 million in investment fees in its most recent fiscal year, just over half of the total $1 billion the fund paid in fees to manage its investments.",
      "Brown and Jelincic are not the only retirees concerned about the state of CalPERS.",
      "\u201cI seriously feel my pension is at risk,\u201d said David Soares, a former prosecutor in the San Francisco Bay area who retired in 2016 after 32 years on the job. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is an absolute wholesale looting of the fund through fees being paid to outside managers. They are letting billions of dollars fly out the door with no benefit.\u201d",
      "CalPERS\u2019 executive ranks have also experienced turmoil over the past decade. A former chief executive of the fund, Federico R. Buenrostro, received a 4.5-year prison sentence in 2016 for accepting $250,000 in cash bribes from a placement agent who solicited pensions to invest in private equity funds.",
      "Since 2020, the fund has seen turnover among its chief investment officers, with two leaving unexpectedly after short tenures. One left after it came to light that he owned shares in a private equity company that does business with CalPERS.",
      "In another setback, a state judge concluded that the fund had violated California\u2019s open meetings law. Scullary declined to comment on the violation, saying the fund follows the law.",
      "Siedle, the investigator hired by the retired public employees group, has probed three public pension funds in recent years. His 2024 analysis of the Minnesota Teachers Retirement Association pension, commissioned and crowdfunded by a group of retired educators, found the pension had underreported the fees it was paying to investment managers by failing to disclose large payments to private equity managers.",
      "Following the investigation, the fund began listing these payments \u2014 $80 million in 2024, or 76% of the fund\u2019s total external manager fees.",
      "Sara Swenson, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota pension, said in a statement that the fees, although previously undisclosed, had always been netted out of the fund\u2019s return calculations. The new practice of detailing fees paid to private investment managers \u201cwas made possible by work that began many years ago,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

    "summary": "As vaccine hesitancy becomes more mainstream, some Americans are grappling with the reality of vaccine-preventable diseases",
    "story": [
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. \u2014 In the time before widespread vaccination, devastating infectious diseases ran rampant in America, killing millions of children and leaving others with lifelong health problems.",
      "Over the next century, vaccines virtually wiped out long-feared scourges like polio and measles and drastically reduced the toll of many others. Today, however, some preventable, contagious diseases are making a comeback as vaccine hesitancy pushes immunization rates down. And well-established vaccines are facing suspicion even from public officials, with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, running the federal health department.",
      "\u201cThis concern, this hesitancy, these questions about vaccines are a consequence of the great success of the vaccines \u2014 because they eliminated the diseases,\u201d said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \u201cIf you\u2019re not familiar with the disease, you don\u2019t respect or even fear it. And therefore you don\u2019t value the vaccine.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine activists even portray the shots as a threat, focusing on the rare risk of side effects while ignoring the far larger risks posed by the diseases themselves \u2014 and years of real-world data that experts say proves the vaccines are safe.",
      "Some Americans know the reality of vaccine-preventable diseases all too well. Here are takeaways from interviews with a few of them by The Associated Press.",
      "Getting a disease while pregnant can change two lives",
      "Janith Farnham has helped shepherd her daughter Jacque through life for decades. Jacque, 60, was born with congenital rubella syndrome, which resulted in hearing, eye and heart problems at birth. There was no vaccine against rubella back then, and Janith contracted it in early pregnancy.",
      "Though Janith, 80, did all she could to help Jacque thrive, the condition took its toll. Jacque eventually developed diabetes, glaucoma, autistic behaviors and arthritis.",
      "Today, Jacque lives in an adult residential home and gets together with Janith four or five days a week. Janith marvels at Jacque\u2019s sense of humor and affectionate nature despite all she\u2019s endured. Jacque is generous with kisses and often signs \u201cdouble I love yous,\u201d even to new people she meets.",
      "Given what her family has been through, Janith finds it \u201cmore than frustrating\u201d when people choose not to get children the MMR shot against measles, mumps and rubella.",
      "\u201cI know what can happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t want anybody else to go through this.\u201d",
      "Delaying a vaccine can be deadly",
      "More than half a century has passed, but Patricia Tobin still vividly recalls seeing her little sister Karen unconscious on the bathroom floor.",
      "It was 1970, Karen was 6, and she had measles. The vaccine against it wasn\u2019t required for school in Miami where they lived. Though Karen\u2019s doctor discussed immunizing the first grader, their mother didn\u2019t share his sense of urgency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that she was against it,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cShe just thought there was time.\u201d",
      "Then came a measles outbreak. After she collapsed in the bathroom, Karen never regained consciousness. She died of encephalitis.",
      "\u201cWe never did get to speak to her again,\u201d Tobin said.",
      "Today, all states require that children get certain vaccines to attend school. But a growing number of people are making use of exemptions. Vanderbilt\u2019s Schaffner said fading memories of measles outbreaks were exacerbated by a fraudulent, retracted study claiming a link between the MMR shot and autism.",
      "The result? Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Preventable diseases can have long-term effects",
      "One of Lora Duguay\u2019s earliest memories is lying in a hospital isolation ward with her feverish, paralyzed body packed in ice. She was three years old.",
      "It was 1959 and Duguay, of Clearwater, Florida, had polio. It was one of the most feared diseases in the U.S., experts say, causing some terrified parents to keep children inside and avoid crowds during epidemics.",
      "Given polio\u2019s visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. Given polio\u2019s visibility, the vaccine against it was widely and enthusiastically welcomed. But the early vaccine that Duguay got was only about 80% to 90% effective. Not enough people were vaccinated or protected yet to stop the virus from spreading.",
      "Though treatment helped her walk again, she eventually developed post-polio syndrome, a neuromuscular disorder that worsens over time. She now gets around in a wheelchair.",
      "The disease that changed her life twice is no longer a problem in the U.S. So many children get the vaccine \u2014 which is far more effective than earlier versions \u2014 that it doesn\u2019t just protect individuals but it prevents occasional cases that arrive in the U.S. from spreading further and protects the vulnerable.",
      "When people aren\u2019t vaccinated, the vulnerable remain at risk",
      "Every night, Katie Van Tornhout rubs a plaster cast of a tiny foot, a vestige of the daughter she lost to whooping cough at just 37 days old.",
      "Callie Grace was born on Christmas Eve 2009. When she turned a month old, she began having symptoms of pertussis, or whooping cough. She was too young for the Tdap vaccine against it and was exposed to someone who hadn\u2019t gotten their booster shot.",
      "At the hospital, Van Tornhout recalled, the medical staff frantically tried to save her, but \u201cwithin minutes, she was gone.\u201d",
      "Today, Callie remains part of her family\u2019s life, and Van Tornhout shares the story with others as she advocates for vaccination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s up to us as adults to protect our children \u2014 like, that\u2019s what a parent\u2019s job is,\u201d Van Tornhout said. \u201cI watched my daughter die from something that was preventable \u2026 You don\u2019t want to walk in my shoes.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Deliberations are officially underway in the sex trafficking and racketeering case against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs as the judge turned the case over to the jury on Monday morning.",
      "Combs has spent the last six weeks on trial in the Southern District of New York as the government is seeking to prove that he was at the helm of a \"criminal enterprise,\" using his employees to help commit several crimes.",
      "The disgraced music mogul has pleaded not guilty to the five counts against him.",
      "Much of the trial focused on Combs' desire for \"freak offs,\" or drug-fueled sexual encounters with hired escorts, often lasting for days at a time.",
      "He's also facing two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution in addition to two charges of sex trafficking and one count of racketeering. As part of the racketeering charge, prosecutors accuse Combs of crimes including kidnapping, arson, bribery and witness tampering.",
      "Federal prosecutors brought 34 witnesses to testify against Combs, including former employees and former girlfriends.",
      "Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, testified for days about her roughly 11-year relationship with Combs. She told the jury that she endured repeated violence while with Combs.",
      "Her participation in \"freak offs\" was consensual at first in order to make Combs happy, but as time went on, she said she felt dependent on drugs to disassociate during the act.",
      "A centerpiece of the case was video of a March 2016 assault Ventura endured at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles. Security footage showed Ventura walking to the elevator bank, barefoot, before Combs came running down the hall in just a towel.",
      "In the video, Combs is seen throwing Ventura to the ground, repeatedly kicking her, and attempting to drag her back to the hotel room. Ventura testified that a sex worker, who was there for a \"freak off,\" was present when she got back to the hotel room.",
      "A hotel security worker testified that Combs sought him out to ask for what he believed to be the only copy of the video. Combs allegedly paid $100,000 to three hotel employees for the video, which he told the worker would \"ruin\" his career.",
      "Combs' defense downplayed the extent of his criminal activity, telling the jury that they admitted that Combs was guilty of domestic violence. But his legal team framed the \"freak offs\" as consensual sexual activity within the confines of complicated personal relationships.",
      "His legal team did not call a single witness to the stand and rested their case only a few hours after the prosecution turned it over to them. The defense initially had a lengthy potential witness list that they said could take days to review.",
      "The legal team, which included Teny Geragos and Marc Agnifilo, relied on its cross-examination to undermine witness testimony. One of the standout moments for the defense was its ability to contradict the testimony of a woman who alleged that Combs dangled her over a hotel balcony by showing he wasn't in the same state when she said the incident happened.",
      "Combs did not testify in his own defense at trial.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian went through jury instructions for roughly two hours on Monday before handing the case to the jury. He expressed his \"heartfelt gratitude\" for their weeks of service.",
      "Jurors followed with their paper copies of the instructions, underlining key portions and taking notes, especially during the judges' explanations of reasonable doubt, witness credibility, and the elements of the charges.",
      "Subramanian told them that if they listened to each other and applied common sense, they would come to a fair verdict.",
      "The jury elected a Black woman who lives in Manhattan and works as a nursing home aide as their foreperson.",
      "Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the top charges of racketeering and sex trafficking. For lesser prostitution charges, the maximum sentence is 10 years in prison.",
      "For racketeering, the jury must decide that a group of two or more people agreed to engage in a criminal enterprise. The judge informed them that understanding can be spoken or unspoken.",
      "The jury must also believe that Combs committed at least two racketeering acts."

Facing mounting pressure and a Supreme Court order, the administration returned him this month to face the smuggling charges, which his attorneys have called \"preposterous.\"",

      "The deaths shocked the rural Idaho community and neighboring Pullman, Washington, where Kohberger was a graduate student studying criminology at Washington State University.",
      "A prison official came to court with records from Kohberger's stay in the Monroe County Correctional Facility after he was arrested, although the subpoena hearing was continued because he must still provide a statement attesting to their authenticity.",

      "Brandon Andreola argued unsuccessfully that his subpoena should be canceled, saying he is his family's sole breadwinner and is worried publicity might lead to him losing his job.",
      "Andreola said his \"relationship with Bryan Kohberger has been minimal and distant since high school,\" with their last \"significant interaction\" taking place in 2020, two years before the stabbings.",

      "Kuniskis, who was leading Ram and Dodge upon his retirement mid-last year, said an array of issues led to the brand\u2019s current situation, including the automaker\u2019s pricing, model launch cadence and, most importantly, problems with a redesign of its Ram 1500. That redesign led to production issues that are still being worked out more than a year after the vehicle\u2019s launch.",
      "\u201cWe tried to do too many things at once,\u201d Kuniskis said of the Ram 1500. \u201cWe literally changed everything instead of doing a cadence of the changes.\u201d",
      "Kuniskis didn\u2019t touch on the larger issues Stellantis was dealing with under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares, who left the automaker in December. Kuniskis was recruited back to Ram amid the change in leadership.",
      "Turnaround plan",
      "Ram is one of the most crucial of Stellantis\u2019 14 brands \u2014 if not the most important. It competes in the highly profitable full-size pickup truck market and industry experts said its success is key to the company reestablishing itself in the commercial sales market.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the backbone of their business,\u201d said Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at CarMax\u2019s data and consumer car shopping site Edmunds.com. \u201cThe market share is hugely important.\u201d",
      "Market share for the Ram 1500 in the U.S. full-size pickup truck market has plummeted from 17.8% in 2019 to 8.4% through roughly the first half of this year, according to Edmunds.",
      "Ram\u2019s sales of full-size trucks, which includes the 1500 and larger versions, have declined 41% from 2019 through 2024, according to company data, allowing competitors such as General Motors and Toyota Motor to increase sales during that time.",
      "While it\u2019s early into the turnaround plan, which goes into next year, Ram has already resurrected its popular Hemi V-8 engine; reintroduced lower-priced pickup truck models; announced a return to NASCAR; and introduced a 10-year/100,000 limited powertrain warranty for new trucks across its lineup, among other things.",
      "Kuniskis has said further announcements could encompass several new potential vehicles, including a passenger van and midsize pickup truck that\u2019s expected in 2027. He\u2019s also launched a \u201cNothing Stops Ram\u201d marketing campaign and delayed the brand\u2019s electrified pickup trucks amid low market demand.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always a method to the madness,\u201d Kuniskis said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a business reason behind something that seems like fun.\u201d",
      "Part of that \u201cfun\u201d includes a return to NASCAR truck racing, where fans can \u201cRide the Hemi\u201d \u2014 a mechanical bull ride that looks like the brand\u2019s new \u201cSymbol of Protest\u201d logo that features the engine with a ram\u2019s head. If riders can stay on for 15 seconds, they receive a special-edition T-shirt that can\u2019t be purchased.",
      "Its splashy return to NASCAR earlier this month in Michigan also included a new truck design, as well as a vehicle doing doughnut burnouts.",
      "Kuniskis declined to disclose sales targets for the Ram brand or its full-size pickup trucks, but he said the company is aiming for a market share somewhere between 20% and 29.9% for its full-size trucks by the end of the plan. Ram Trucks had a roughly 17% share of the U.S. full-size pickup truck market in 2024, according to industry data.",
      "\u201cI know exactly where we want to be and what our expectations are,\u201d he said. \u201cI should legitimately have a market share that starts with a two. \u2026 That\u2019s a starting point for us.\u201d",
      "But Kuniskis said market share is only one metric and that plant utilization and profits are also important. While Ram\u2019s overall sales are down, he said retail sales \u2014 a closely watched metric \u2014 are expected to be up by about 28% through the first half of the year.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to chase share just for the sake of chasing share,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to have all plants running at full capacity to maximize my efficiency.\u201d",
      "'Last Tenth LFG'",
      "Kuniskis wears a black band on his left wrist with white lettering that reads \u201cLast Tenth LFG.\u201d",
      "The first part has been a mantra of Kuniskis\u2019 for years to push his top lieutenants to perform as best as they can. The latter part is an acronym with many meanings, including \u201clet\u2019s freaking go.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you were in school, they told you \u2018Get an \u2018A,\u2019 everything will be great. You\u2019ll be successful in life.\u2032 Not true. Not true,\u201d Kuniskis said. \u201cThey remember the guy that way pushed beyond just getting an \u2018A\u2019 in school and did something different, push that last tenth.\u201d",
      "Kuniskis handed out the wristbands to his team as well as the brand\u2019s dealers during his return to an annual dealer conference in January as a way to regain the trust of retailers after years of contentious relations over incentives, products and price increases.",
      "So far it seems to be working, according to Michael Bettenhausen, a dealer in Illinois who chairs the Stellantis National Dealer Council.",
      "\u201cEverything that Tim has showed us has us convinced that the brand is on a path to get back to the volumes that we\u2019ve seen from years past,\u201d Bettenhausen said. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited that Tim is leading this charge. It\u2019s really remarkable.\u201d",
      "Bettenhausen also said the full-size pickup truck market is key to the success of the company and its dealers. It is made up of buyers who often have generational loyalties to a brand and act as ambassadors for it.",
      "\u201cCustomer loyalty is a huge part of that business,\u201d Yoon said. \u201cFor a lot of these people, it doesn\u2019t matter if their brand is objectively the best product or not. It\u2019s just that whatever the automaker is doing, they feel like it\u2019s best for them.\u201d",
      "Bringing back the automaker\u2019s well-known Hemi V-8 may have been a good start, as Kuniskis said the company received 12,000 Hemi orders on the first day pickup trucks with the engine were available for dealers to order.",
      "As the Hemi returns, Ram\u2019s electrification plans, including a new plug-in truck and an all-electric model, are being delayed. Kuniskis declined to discuss production timing for the all-electric model, which was initially expected last year. He said the plug-in model \u2014 known as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV \u2014 will begin production this year but declined to specify when consumer sales will begin.",
      "Kuniskis said he believes the EREV will be more of a differentiator in the market and more important in the brand\u2019s turnaround plan through 2026.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really bullish on the year. I\u2019m really proud of how we started this year and that\u2019s just using traditional tactics,\u201d Kuniskis said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten to the new stuff yet.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Republican-controlled Senate began voting on amendments to President Donald Trump's massive tax cut and spending bill, with the goal of passing it later in the day.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Entering the final stretch of an arduous process, the Republican-controlled Senate began voting Monday on amendments to President Donald Trump's massive tax cut and spending bill, with the goal of passing it later in the day.",
      "The 940-page legislation, which the Senate advanced on a 51-49 vote late Saturday, was still taking shape even as the \"vote-a-rama\" began \u2014 a process in which senators can offer an unlimited number of amendments \u2014 with GOP leaders hoping to use it to satisfy concerns from wavering factions.",
      "Republicans need to hold 50 of their 53 senators to pass the bill. They have lost Sens. Rand Paul, of Kentucky, who complained that it adds too much to the national debt, and Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who blasted the Medicaid cuts as damaging to his home state.",
      "\u201cSo what do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off Medicaid?\u201d Tillis said in a fiery floor speech Sunday evening.",
      "Tillis said \u201camateurs\" are advising Trump and conflating longstanding health care policy with \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse.\u201d Hours earlier, he announced that he won't run for re-election in 2026, after clashing with Trump over his opposition.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine voted to advance the bill on Saturday but said she was \"leaning against\" voting for it on final passage. She has concerns with the Medicaid cuts and said she prefers raising taxes on high earners. And Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also voted to keep the process moving over the weekend after discussions with Republican leaders, has voiced Medicaid concerns.",
      "In addition, a group of conservatives \u2014 Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Mike Lee, R-Utah \u2014\u00a0are insisting on revising the bill to reduce the deficit impact.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects that the Senate bill would increase the national debt by $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years \u2014 it found that revenues would fall by about $4.5 trillion and spending would be cut by $1.2 trillion. The bill is also projected to lead to 11.8 million people losing their health insurance by 2034 if it becomes law, the CBO said.",
      "The GOP is using a budget trick known as \"current policy baseline\" to hide the cost of extending the tax cuts Trump signed into law in 2017, effectively lowering the sticker price by $3.8 trillion. That tactic has not been used in the budget process before and would set a precedent to weaken the Senate's 60-vote rule.",
      "The Senate voted 53-47 to greenlight the new baseline on Monday, with all Republicans voting in favor.",
      "\u201cThis is the nuclear option,\u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., warning that it will \u201ccut both ways\u201d when the majority flips.",
      "The legislation would also slash taxes on tips and overtime pay. It includes a $150 billion boost to military spending this year, along with a surge in federal money to carry out Trump\u2019s mass deportation and immigration enforcement agenda. It would partly pay for that with cuts to Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and clean energy funding.",
      "And it includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling ahead of an August deadline to avert a default on the country\u2019s obligations.",
      "\"The permanent tax relief included in our bill means Americans keeping more of their hard-earned money and American businesses growing and investing in our country and our workers,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "The Senate version of the bill includes steeper Medicaid cuts than the House version, along with changes to the clean energy funding rollbacks. It shortens the timeline for an expanded $40,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to five years, before cutting it back down to $10,000. And it contains a series of provisions for priorities in Alaska, including a tax break for whaling captains, in an apparent attempt to win over Murkowski.",
      "The Monday vote-a-rama comes after a rare weekend work session for the Senate.",
      "On Saturday night, after hours of delays and uncertainty, the package for Trump's agenda cleared its first major hurdle, with Tillis and Paul joining all Democrats in opposition.",
      "The narrow but successful vote occurred after a small band of GOP holdouts \u2014 including Johnson, Scott and Lee \u2014 struck a deal with Thune on amendments. But those amendments still have to get a majority vote to be adopted. Vice President JD Vance, a former senator, attended meetings in Thune's office and helped sway their votes, while Trump golfed and held his own meetings with key senators.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., forced a full reading of the bill, which delayed the process by about 16 hours. Democrats don't have the votes to sink the bill, as Republicans are using the filibuster-proof \"budget reconciliation\" process to get around the 60-vote threshold.",
      "\"Senate Democrats will use vote-a-rama to highlight the disastrous impacts of the GOP\u2019s historically unpopular proposal,\" a Schumer spokesperson said, adding that \"Republicans ripping away health care from millions of Americans and closing rural hospitals across the country to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy.\"",
      "If the bill passes the Senate, it would head to the House, which passed its own version of the legislation on May 22 by a single vote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his leadership team have told rank-and-file members over the weekend to be prepared to return to Washington as early as Tuesday, with a possible final vote on the Senate bill on Wednesday.",
      "GOP leaders are aiming to send the bill to Trump's desk for his signature by the president's self-imposed July Fourth deadline, which is Friday.",
      "Like in the Senate, Republican leaders in the House can afford only three GOP defections. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., has been opposed to the legislation from the start, arguing it adds to the debt. And a handful of moderate Republicans are sounding the alarm over Medicaid cuts to their district and the Senate's changes to the SALT deduction."

      "Home Depot said Monday that it is buying GMS, a building-products distributor, for about $4.3 billion as the retailer moves to draw more sales from contractors and other home professionals.",
      "Shares of Home Depot were roughly flat in early trading Monday. GMS shares jumped more than 11%.",
      "As part of the deal, the Home Depot-owned subsidiary SRS Distribution will buy all outstanding shares of GMS for $110 per share, which adds up to about $4.3 billion and amounts to total enterprise value including net debt of about $5.5 billion, the company said.",
      "Home Depot said it expects the acquisition to be completed by early 2026.",
      "Home Depot\u2019s announcement also concludes a potential bidding war between the big-box retailer and billionaire Brad Jacobs. Jacobs\u2019 building-products distributor QXO had offered about $5 billion in cash to acquire GMS and said it would press forward with a hostile takeover if the company\u2019s management rejected the proposal.",
      "As Home Depot chases growth, it\u2019s gone after a steadier and more lucrative piece of the home improvement business: electricians, roofers, home renovators and other professionals who tackle large projects year-round and need a lot of supplies. Home Depot said it\u2019s speeding along that strategy with the GMS deal.",
      "Home Depot bought SRS Distribution \u2014 the subsidiary that\u2019s acquiring GMS \u2014 last year for $18.25 billion, in the largest acquisition in its history. Texas-based SRS sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, roofing and pool businesses and it has bought up many other smaller suppliers as it\u2019s grown.",
      "Home Depot\u2019s focus on selling to professionals is well-timed. Sales from do-it-yourself customers have slowed as higher mortgage rates have decreased housing turnover and dampened homeowners\u2019 demand for larger projects because of higher borrowing costs.",
      "The company said it expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the full fiscal year and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to rise about 1%.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that a federal prison inmate cannot sue corrections officers for an alleged assault in which he was punched, kicked and had his face slammed into a wall.",
      "The loss for inmate Andrew Fields is the latest setback for plaintiffs seeking to hold federal officials accountable for constitutional violations.",
      "Although the Supreme Court allowed such claims in a 1971 ruling called Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, it has since changed course and made it almost impossible to do so in most situations.",
      "The unsigned ruling, which had no dissents, said that if Fields' claim was allowed to move forward, it \"could have negative systemic consequences for prison officials.\" Fields has other ways of vindicating his rights, the court added.",
      "Fields, 53, had sought to bring a \"Bivens claim\" arising from the 2021 incident at a federal prison in Lee County, Virginia. He is now at a different prison in Florida.",
      "The facts are disputed, with officers saying he initially assaulted them, which he denies.",
      "Fields, serving a lengthy sentence for drugs and gun offenses, alleges that the incident began when he went to lunch without bringing a required movement pass.",
      "While being moved to a special housing unit, Fields says officers punched him in the face and stomped on him.",
      "Then, once he was secured in the unit and restrained, the officers shoved his face into the wall, slammed a security shield into his back, and again punched him and kneed him in the groin, he alleges.",
      "A federal judge threw out Fields' lawsuit, which he filed without the help of a lawyer. But in a 2024 ruling, the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revived it, saying he could bring a claim under the Constitution's 8th Amendment, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment in the prison context.",
      "The Supreme Court has over several decades shown a reluctance to allow Bivens claims.",
      "In the most recent decision, the court in 2022 said Border Patrol agents could not be sued.",
      "In the 12 months after that ruling, lower courts cited it 228 times in a variety of cases against all kinds of federal officials, an NBC News investigation found. In 195 of those cases, constitutional claims were dismissed.",
      "Congress has never enacted legislation that would specifically allow federal officials to be sued individually for constitutional violations, even though it allows similar claims to be brought against state and local officials.",
      "In fact, the appeals court noted that there is \"little doubt that Fields would have a viable ... claim against prison officials if he had been incarcerated at a state prison.\"",

      "Hertzberg\u2019s work focused on the most vulnerable groups impacted by pollution: pregnant and nursing people, young children and babies, the elderly, people with preexisting and chronic health conditions and people living in communities exposed to higher levels of pollution. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be controversial, but it\u2019s become so in this political climate, she said.",
      "\u201cAmericans should be able to drink their water and breathe their air without being poisoned. And if they aren\u2019t, then our government is failing,\u201d she said.",
      "Berg, who also directed the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH from 2003-2011, said the dissent isn\u2019t motivated by partisan criticism. He said the employees hope it will help the EPA get back to the mission for which it was established \u2014 which \u201conly matters if you breathe air and drink water.\u201d",
      "The letter outlines what the EPA employees see as five main concerns: undermining public trust; ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters; reversing EPA\u2019s progress in America\u2019s most vulnerable communities; dismantling the Office of Research and Development; and promoting a culture of fear, forcing staff to choose between their livelihood and well-being.",
      "EPA has cut funding and rolled back federal regulations",
      "Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, EPA has cut funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, vowed to roll back federal regulations that lower air pollution in national parks and tribal reservations, wants to undo a ban on a type of asbestos and proposed repealing rules that limit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from power plants fueled by coal and natural gas.",
      "Zeldin began reorganizing the EPA\u2019s research and development office as part of his push to slash their budget and gut their study of climate change and environmental justice. And he\u2019s seeking to roll back pollution rules that an Associated Press examination found were estimated to save 30,000 lives and $275 billion every year.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die,\u201d said Carol Greider, a Nobel laureate and professor of molecular and cellular biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who also signed the letter. She described last week\u2019s East Coast heat wave as evidence of the ways people are feeling the effects of climate change. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t have scientists at the EPA to understand how what we do that goes into the air affects our health, more people are going to die,\u201d she added.",
      "Berg said the declarations of dissent from both the NIH and EPA employees are noteworthy because they represent scientists speaking out as their careers are on the line. Even non-agency employees have to consider whether the government will withdraw research funding.",
      "Greider, asked about fears of repercussions or retaliation, said she\u2019s \u201cliving the repercussions of everything.\u201d She regularly meets with graduate students who are worried about pursuing scientific careers as labs lose funding.",
      "It\u2019s a long-term problem if we aren\u2019t supporting the next generation of scientists, she said: \u201cThat\u2019s decades worth of loss.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The WNBA is expanding to 18 teams over the next five years, with Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia all set to join the league by 2030.",
      "Cleveland will begin play in 2028, Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia the season after, assuming they get approval from the NBA and WNBA Board of Governors. Toronto and Portland will enter the league next year.",
      "\"The demand for women's basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \"This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league's extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women's professional basketball.\"",
      "All three new teams announced Monday have NBA ownership groups. Each paid a $250 million expansion fee, which is about five times as much as Golden State dished out for a team a few years ago. All three teams will also be investing more money through building practice facilities and other such amenities.",
      "\"It's such a natural fit that when you already have this basketball-related infrastructure, these strategies, cultures that you find to be successful, combinations of personnel that you find to be successful,\" said Nic Barlage, CEO of Rock Entertainment Group and the Cavaliers. \"Extending that into the WNBA, is just a natural next progression, especially if you have a desire to grow like we do.\"",
      "Both Cleveland and Detroit had WNBA teams in the past and Philadelphia was the home for an ABL team.",
      "\"This is a huge win for Detroit and the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \"Today marks the long-hoped-for return of the WNBA to a city with deep basketball roots and a championship tradition. Detroit played a key role in the league's early growth, and we're proud to reignite that legacy as the WNBA ascends to new heights. Our plans will bring new energy, investment and infrastructure to our city and the WNBA, and additional resources to our community.\"",
      "Detroit sports stars Grant Hill, Chris Webber and Jared Goff will have minority ownership stakes in the team.",
      "The Cleveland and Detroit ownership groups said the Rockers and Shock \u2014 the names of the previous teams \u2014 would be considered but they'd do their due diligence before deciding on what the franchises will be called.",
      "\"Rockers will be a part of the mix for sure, but we are at this point, we're not going to commit to a brand identity because we want to really get into it with our fans, do some research, be very thorough and thoughtful in that process,\" Barlage said.",
      "The Detroit and Cleveland teams will play at the NBA arenas that currently exist, while Philadelphia is planning on a new building that will be completed, hopefully by 2030.",
      "\"We tell the city it's going to open in 2031. We're hoping for 2030,\" said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment Managing Partner and co-founder Josh Harris, who owns the 76ers. \"So we're trying to underpromise and overdeliver. But, right now it's 2031, so that we have a year gap, you know. We've got the Xfinity center, the Wells Fargo, they'll play there.\"",
      "Adding these three teams will give the league more natural rivalries with another team on the East Coast and Detroit and Cleveland are near each other.",
      "\"I think there's some great historical rivalries in the NBA among these cities and, I think that will carry over to the WNBA,\" Detroit Pistons vice president Arn Tellem said. \"I would love nothing more to have a rivalry like we do in the NBA with Cleveland and Indiana, Philadelphia and New York and all these great cities and, and I think we will.\"",
      "Other cities that bid on teams that didn't get them include St. Louis; Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; Nashville, Tenn.; Houston; Miami; Denver; and Charlotte, N.C.",
      "\"We didn't know the demand would be where the demand ended up when we ran the process last fall into the winter,\" Engelbert said. \"Given the very high demand and supply, we wanted to evaluate, too, because we're very careful about, you know, making sure we're balancing the number of roster spots, the number of teams.",
      "\"But one thing I'm very struck by as we get into a new media deal, as the media market evolves, you know, being in these three big basketball cities is going to help from a media perspective, a corporate partners perspective.\"",
      "All the metrics, such as attendance, television ratings and sponsorships, have been on the rise the last few seasons.",
      "\"You're seeing the key performance indicators around the business, but then also just the communal impact of having a women's professional sports team,\" Barlage said. \"The largest growing segment of our Cavs youth academy, which serves 60,000 kids across the state of Ohio and upstate New York, the fastest growing segment is girls. You know, it's growing at a 30% clip year over year in participation rates. And so for us to be able to create role models, to be able to create symbols of progress, to create having ambassadors within the community representing all of these things.\""

      "The monthlong celebration of LGBTQ Pride reached its rainbow-laden crescendo Sunday as huge crowds took part in jubilant, daylong street parties from New York to San Francisco.",
      "Pride celebrations typically weave politics and protest together with colorful pageantry, but this year's iterations took a decidedly more defiant stance as Republicans, led by President Donald Trump, have sought to roll back LGBTQ friendly policies.",
      "The theme of the festivities in Manhattan was, appropriately, \"Rise Up: Pride in Protest.\" San Francisco's Pride theme was \"Queer Joy is Resistance,\" while Seattle was simply \"Louder.\"",
      "Lance Brammer, a 56-year-old teacher from Ohio attending his first Pride parade in New York, said he felt \"validated\" as he marveled at the sheer size of the city's celebration, the nation's oldest and largest.",
      "\"With the climate that we have politically, it just seems like they're trying to do away with the whole LGBTQ community, especially the trans community,\" he said wearing a vivid, multicolored shirt. \"And it just shows that they've got a fight ahead of them if they think that they're going to do that with all of these people here and all of the support.\"",
      "In San Francisco, Xander Briere said the LGBTQ+ community is fighting for its very survival in the face of sustained attacks and changing public sentiment, particularly against transgender people.",
      "\"We're slowly rolling back the clock, and it's unfortunate and it's scary,\" the program specialist at the San Francisco Community Health Center said. \"It feels like the world hates us right now, but this is a beautiful community celebration of resistance, of history to show the world that we are here and we are not going anywhere.\"",
      "Manhattan's parade wound its way down Fifth Avenue with more than 700 participating groups greeted by huge crowds.",
      "The rolling celebration passed the Stonewall Inn, a Greenwich Village gay bar where a 1969 police raid triggered protests and fired up the LGBTQ+ rights movement. The first pride march, held in New York City in 1970, commemorated the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. The site is now a national monument.",
      "Meanwhile, marchers in San Francisco, host to another of the world's largest Pride events, headed down the California city's central Market Street to concert stages set up at the Civic Center Plaza. Denver, Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis and Toronto, Canada, were among the other major North American cities that hosted Pride parades Sunday.",
      "Several global cities including Tokyo, Paris and Sao Paulo, held their events earlier this month while others come later in the year, including London in July and Rio de Janeiro in November.",
      "Since taking office in January, Trump has taken specific aim at transgender people, removing them from the military, preventing federal insurance programs from paying for gender-affirming surgeries for young people and attempting to keep transgender athletes out of girls and women's sports.",
      "\"We have to be visible. We have to come together. We have to fight. Our existence is trying to be erased,\" said Jahnel Butler, one of the community grand marshals at the San Francisco parade.",
      "Peter McLaughlin said he's lived in New York for years but has never attended the Pride parade. The 34-year-old Brooklyn resident said he felt compelled this year as a transgender man.",
      "\"A lot of people just don't understand that letting people live doesn't take away from their own experience, and right now it's just important to show that we're just people,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Gabrielle Meighan, 23, of New Jersey, said she felt it was important to come out to this year's celebrations because they come days after the tenth anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark June 26, 2015, ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges that recognized same-sex marriage nationwide.",
      "Manhattan also hosted on Sunday the Queer Liberation March, an activism-centered event launched in recent years amid concerns that the more mainstream parade had become too corporate.",
      "Marchers holding signs that included \"Gender affirming care saves lives\" and \"No Pride in apartheid\" headed north from the city's AIDS Memorial to Columbus Circle near Central Park.",
      "Among the other headwinds faced by gay rights groups this year is the loss of corporate sponsorship.",
      "American companies have pulled back support of Pride events, reflecting a broader walking back of diversity and inclusion efforts amid shifting public sentiment.",
      "NYC Pride said earlier this month that about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. Organizers of San Francisco Pride said they lost the support of five major corporate donors, including Comcast and Anheuser-Busch."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday took up a new challenge to campaign finance restrictions in a case brought by Republicans seeking to overturn limits on party committees spending money in coordination with individual candidates.",
      "It is the latest in a long-running sequence of cases that have eroded campaign finance restrictions since Congress sought to strictly limit them in the 1970s.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has long been skeptical of campaign finance restrictions on free speech grounds, with its most notable ruling being the 2010 Citizens United v. FEC decision that paved the way for unlimited independent expenditures by outside groups.",
      "However, in a 2001 ruling, the court upheld the restrictions at issue in the new case, meaning the justices would have to overturn that decision for the Republicans to win. The court will hear oral arguments and issue a ruling in its next term, which begins in October.",
      "The challenge was brought by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the campaigns of two candidates in the 2022 elections: now-Vice President JD Vance, who was running as a Republican candidate for Senate in Ohio, and former Rep. Steve Chabot, a Republican congressman from the same state who lost his re-election bid.",
      "The Federal Election Commission, under the direction of the Trump administration, has sided with the challengers, saying it agrees the restrictions violate the Constitution's First Amendment.",
      "The restrictions, first imposed via the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1971, will now be defended by the Democratic National Committee and associated committees, which filed a motion to intervene in the case.",
      "The case does not involve other campaign restrictions, such as limits on how much individuals can donate to a candidate or party.",
      "Under current law, amended over the years by the Supreme Court and Congress, parties can make unlimited independent expenditures in support of a candidate but cannot exceed limits on coordinated spending.",
      "This can include such spending as hiring a venue or fundraising consultants, or paying for a candidate's travel, the Republicans said in court papers.",
      "The current limit varies based on voting-age population in a specific House of Representatives or Senate election, but it can be as much as almost $4 million for Senate races and $127,000 for at-large House seats.",
      "With the flood of spending that resulted from the Citizens United ruling, giving rise to the creation of independent \"super PACs\"  to funnel unlimited money into elections, the existing caps have had increasingly little effect in addressing the original intent of keeping money out of politics to avoid corruption or the appearance of it.",
      "\u201cThe court\u2019s reasoning upholding these party spending limits has been undermined by more recent court campaign finance cases,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law expert at UCLA School of Law.",
      "\u201cThe status quo \u2014 where outside groups like super PACs can raise unlimited sums but political parties face much more severe limitations \u2014 may create worse conditions in terms of empowering unaccountable groups and increasing negative ads,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

    "published": "Sun, 29 Jun 2025 17:45:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Queer love stories are as iconic as the LGBTQ+ community that it centers on. To highlight some of these stories, TODAY.com has compiled a list of 25 queer romance films to watch.",
    "story": [
      "Queer love stories have stood the test of time as filmmakers strive to tell authentic narratives, despite LGBTQ+ representation in films facing challenges throughout history.",
      "Films showcasing love in the LGBTQ+ community have been around for more than a century. Over time, they've become an important form of queer representation, helping to counter stereotypes and combat negative tropes in media.",
      "But, getting to this level of representation wasn\u2019t easy. While films depicting queer love were not formally banned, the Hays Code, also known as the Motion Picture Production Code, had Hollywood studios self-enforce a set of guidelines from around 1934 to 1968 to prevent government interference. Centered around \"moral standards\" and social values, the guidelines purported to ensure movies presented viewers with \"correct standards of life\" by banning profanity, obscenity and graphic violence. It also prevented overt or positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ relationships, according to a library guide from Ithaca College.",
      "It wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the Hays Code was effectively challenged. The organization now known as the Motion Picture Association (MPA) established a film content rating system in 1968 which served as the code\u2019s replacement.",
      "Though it\u2019s been over 50 years since the Hays Code, and much progress has been made for LGBTQ+ representation in cinema, there still remain ongoing challenges for accurate and authentic narratives. The queer community continues to navigate a fickle film industry that periodically offers room for diverse storytelling, but can miss the mark with film tropes like the \u201cgay best friend,\u201d the \u201ccloseted bully\" or \"bury your gays,\" referring to a pattern of queer characters being killed off in shows and movies.",
      "Carlos King, CEO of Kingdom Reign Entertainment and a TV industry creative, tells TODAY.com that it\u2019s important to have authentic queer stories on screen so viewers can move past stereotypes and caricatures.",
      "\u201cI want to see (movies) starring queer people, not as being the sidekick to the main cast member or being the glam squad that we just see on television,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are leading. We have leading roles in our personal lives. We are executives. We\u2019re a vice president, presidents, CEOs of multiple companies.\u201d",
      "King says he strives to bring the representation \u2014 including that of love in the LGBTQ+ community \u2014\u00a0that he didn't have growing up to the screen.",
      "\u201cBeing a young gay Black boy from Detroit, Michigan, one of 10 siblings, I know all about desiring to look at a television screen and wanting to see someone like you reflected back,\" he says.",
      "Filmmaker Elegance Bratton, whose 2022 autobiographical breakout military drama, \u201cThe Inspection,\u201d received rave reviews from critics, tells TODAY.com that showing queer romance on screen helps to combat the negativity often felt in society.",
      "\u201cShowing love is always a good thing. We live in a world where hatred of queer people is reaching a fever point,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe need to see queer people loving on each other because it\u2019s real. We do love and that spirit is indomitable.\u201d",
      "Andrea Ambam, director of programming at Level Forward, a public benefit entertainment company, agrees, telling TODAY.com that seeing these stories on the big screen can help members of the LGBTQ+ community feel seen.",
      "\u201cI know and believe that queer films are important because of the way they\u2019re able to reach us through the screen,\u201d she says. \u201cThe way they\u2019re able to find, often, young people who may or may not be questioning their belonging in their homes, in their schools, in their communities, and they reach across the screen and say, \u2018You belong. You are here. There are more people like you.\u2019\u201d"

I still had all these things to work through and my happiness was never really dependent on the way that I looked in the way that I thought. I think there\u2019s a lot of people who sit around saying, \u201cWell, if I just lost 10 pounds \u2026 if I didn\u2019t have this loose skin, my life would be so much better.\u201d But there\u2019s no end goal, you just find something else. The way you look will never be the only thing. And I feel like I\u2019ve learned that firsthand a lot over the last few years.",
      "Some of the most resonating things I find are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way, because I truly don\u2019t think there are many unique experiences. Often if you just say the one thing that you carry the most shame over out loud, you\u2019ll find 100 other people that feel that way too. That\u2019s kind of why I leaned into it.",
      "It goes both ways.  Every time somebody goes, \"Oh, I really related to this thing, it made me feel less alone,\" I get to be like, \"Oh, because you related to this, now I know that I\u2019m not alone in that thought.\" I hope that other people scrolling through the comment section of a video they resonate with are seeing 100 other people that are like, \"Me too, me too, me too.\" And we can make everyone feel less alone together.",
      "I would have to have more of a routine with it. I usually just write down ideas as they come to me. I'll think of a line while I\u2019m driving or at work and I\u2019ll just type it into my phone. Eventually I\u2019ll scroll through all the one-liners on my notes app and expand on one of them. And if I feel like it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019ll go downstairs in my studio and record and post it. I\u2019d say 99% of the time, I write, record and post all in the same night.",
      "He was not wanting to do vows in front of people. He is very loving and very sweet and he\u2019s not shy to tell me how he feels but he is definitely shy to speak in front of a crowd. Originally he was like, \u201cCan we please just do private vows?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNope, I want to do them in front of everybody.\u201d So we are going to do them.",
      "I honestly don\u2019t think they will be that crazy or that amazing. They\u2019ll be pretty personalized, it\u2019ll probably be the way I would talk to him on a normal day.",
      "I think that\u2019s kind of the scary thing about success: It never feels like enough. Like everything after, if it\u2019s not quite up to par, you always feel like you didn\u2019t do as good a job, you know? Obviously in my head, I hope for success moving forward. But I also just hope to keep enjoying it. I love doing it, it\u2019s my total passion. It\u2019s my journal entries come to life. It\u2019s what my therapist told me to do to get regulated. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that it\u2019s turned into something like this, and I just hope that I continue to love that and I continue to be able to connect with people.",
      "I remember saying to my therapist once at the beginning, \"What if I can\u2019t continue it? What if I can\u2019t maintain it?\" And she was like, \"Nobody can ever take away what\u2019s already happened.\" So I think that I get to move forward knowing that what\u2019s already happened is mine. Obviously I hope for more of it, but even if all I got was what I have, I would be so happy to have it."

      "As \u201cLove Island USA\u201d headed into its fourth week, fan-favorite Hannah Fields was dumped from the island, despite having what many considered to be the strongest connection in the villa with Pepe.",
      "It was a twist few viewers saw coming, and as she exited the villa, a few burning questions for her remained. In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, she comes with some answers.",
      "Charlie or Pepe? Where Hannah\u2019s Heart Lies",
      "The end of Hannah\u2019s journey on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d was a choice made by her fellow islanders. During Sunday\u2019s episode, the islanders were informed that America had been voting on their favorite guys and girls, as individuals. When the bottom three guys and bottom the girls were revealed, the rest of the villa had to choose two people \u2014 a guy and a girl \u2014 to dump. The girls eliminated Hannah, and the guys nixed Jeremiah.",
      "To many viewers, the islanders\u2019 selections were shocking moves. Jeremiah had been coming out of his shell after finding resolution in his hectic breakup with Huda. As for Hannah, she had just witnessed her first connection, Charlie, exit the villa in the same way and was finding a bit of happiness with a new guy, Pepe.",
      "Following her elimination, a pressing question remained: Does Hannah\u2019s heart lie with Pepe ... or with Charlie?",
      "\u201cMy heart is waiting for Pepe to get out of that villa,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI\u2019ve just been waiting and waiting to see if that\u2019s going to go anywhere. We had a really good talk before I left, and I\u2019ve just really been missing him.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come from this, and I don\u2019t know where his heart lies. I just know how I feel.\u201d",
      "Hannah also acknowledges her complicated feelings about Charlie, too: \u201cI think with Charlie as well, I don\u2019t know where his heart lies now. Obviously a lot has happened since he\u2019s left, and that can\u2019t be easy to witness.\u201d",
      "For now, she\u2019s acknowledges that the \u201creal world\u201d is much different than the villa, where around-the-clock proximity plays a big role.",
      "She adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s a waiting game to see where everything lies out and what really aligns for us, and see if we really work outside of the villa.\u201d",
      "Did Hannah Hope Pepe Would Leave With Her?",
      "Feelings are always heightened immediately following dumpings, and Hannah\u2019s was no exception. Was there any part of Hannah that thought Pepe might feel strongly enough to leave with her?",
      "\u201cHe had kind of mentioned it, but I just don\u2019t really think that it was an option,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cEven when Charlie left, I had thought about leaving. I think I had told Iris, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 but I just don\u2019t think it was an actual option to leave. I don\u2019t really know exactly. Maybe it is.\u201d",
      "Despite her disappointment in leaving her connection behind in Fiji, Hannah holds no grudges against Pepe for staying.",
      "\u201cI kind of had told him, \u2018Don\u2019t ruin your experience.\u2019 I wanted him to have the best experience, and I don\u2019t hold it against him for not leaving at all, definitely. But you know I wish that he could have.\u201d",
      "Who Does Hannah See Winning \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Despite the girls choosing to send her home, Hannah maintains that they will remain close.",
      "\u201cI think our sisterhood is really, really strong,\u201d Hanna tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think obviously there were moments where we\u2019d have little, you know, back-and-forth arguments \u2014 but honestly not really. There were only a couple notable ones and we really bounced back super fast from that.\u201d",
      "She mentions Huda, who had pursued Pepe briefly without being upfront with Hannah about it.",
      "\u201cI did have that falling out with Huda and we never really resolved that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that would need to be resolved post-villa, but I\u2019m not closing myself off to any of them.\u201d",
      "Drama aside, Hannah maintains hope for her villa friendships and even has someone she\u2019s rooting to win.",
      "\u201cEven though she hurt my feelings, I really hope that Cierra, either with Nic or this new connection with Elan, I hope that she really gets her man,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cI think she\u2019s really deserving, and I think that she\u2019s somebody who really was there for the true reason of finding a partner.\u201d",
      "As for watching the rest of the season? \u201cOh, yes I will, absolutely. Even if I wasn\u2019t on the show, I would\u2019ve watched the show the whole time.\u201d"

In 2024, Col\u00f3n-Zayas' performance won her an Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy, adding to the impressive collection of awards the show has picked up since premiering in 2022.",

Col\u00f3n-Zayas says it represented her character \u201cpushing through that fear ... rather than just assuming that these people are going to shut me out.\"",

      "\u201cI wanted to protect her (Mansfield) from him because he did not protect her,\u201d she said, referencing his book.",
      "\u201cThat (interview) was very painful to me because I never really got the response I was hoping for. It\u2019s my job to give people the benefit of the doubt and to try to understand, and that\u2019s what I did. But he betrayed my mother and he betrayed my family,\u201d she said.",
      "She was ultimately grateful the story did not become mainstream until she could share it herself.",

    "story": [
      "ABC's new \"Golden Bachelor\" Mel Owens, 66, is in hot water for some controversial remarks he made about dating older women.",
      "On the University of Michigan Athletics' podcast \u201cIn the Trenches,\u201d the former NFL star, who played college football at the university, revealed what he's looking for in a partner and said he's not interested in dating someone his own age.",
      "\u201cThey asked me, \u2018What\u2019s your preferences?\u2019 So I just said, '45 to 60,' just being honest,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then the process went and I was selected and then we had lunch with the executive producer. I said, \u2018You know, if they\u2019re 60 or over, I\u2019m cutting them.\u2019\u201d",

      "Owens then touched on the selection process for the women on the show and said he has \"no say\" in who's chosen to be on the series. Although he's confident that the women are \"going to be beautiful,\" he said he does have a few more preferences when it comes to dating.",
      "\"They got to be fit because I\u2019m staying in shape and work out and stuff. And I told them, 'Try to stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs,'\" he shared.",
      "Other than looks, Owens said he enjoys a woman who's a \"lifetime learner\" and likes to \u201cwork out, stay fit, eat, have fun, be energetic and live life.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Warner Bros. and ABC for comment but has not heard back yet.",
      "After hearing about his dating preferences, social media users said they're not interested in watching the new season of \"The Golden Bachelor.\"",
      "The show's inaugural season saw then-72-year-old Gerry Turner find love with contestant Theresa Nist, whom he later divorced after the show.",
      "\"Ok thanks #TheGoldenBachelor and ABC for the heads up so I know NOT to watch this loser on TV,\" one person wrote on X in regards to Owens.",

    "summary": "Foxes have been digging burrows and leaving their droppings at the site of Google's new headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Google's much-hyped new U.K. headquarters in London's King's Cross neighborhood hasn't opened yet, but it's already drawn some unexpected attention from locals.",
      "Local foxes, that is.",
      "The building, which is under construction, has been nicknamed the \"landscraper\" because it spans 1,082 feet wide and 11 floors tall.",
      "Created by British designer Thomas Heatherwick, it will reportedly be completed later this year and cost the tech giant upwards of \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion). Construction began in 2017. It is anticipated to eventually house up to 7,000 Google employees.",
      "For now, however, some of the more frequent visitors might be the foxes that have been digging burrows in the manicured grounds and leaving their droppings behind on the building's nearly 1,000-foot-long rooftop garden.",
      "\u201cFox sightings at construction sites are pretty common, and our King\u2019s Cross development is no exception,\u201d a Google spokesperson told NBC News. But, the person added, \u201cWhile foxes have been occasionally spotted at the site, their appearances have been brief and have had minimal impact on the ongoing construction.\u201d",
      "NBC News spoke to nearly two dozen construction workers at the construction site, where a cacophony of noise from the drilling and hammering filled the streets as dust dispersed into the air. But when asked whether they had seen any foxes, most refused to comment, citing nondisclosure agreements.",
      "One worker, who requested anonymity due to the NDA, told NBC News, \u201cPersonally, I haven\u2019t seen one, but there are so many open entrances to the building I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it had gotten inside.\u201d",
      "Still, Kareen Mascerenhas, 25, who works at a store directly across from the construction site, said she had spotted a fox last winter. \u201cI was shutting the store when I saw one just run past that side and in there,\u201d she said, pointing to Google\u2019s construction.",
      "But any sightings of the bushy-tailed vulpines feel neither rare nor unique in a city where the number of foxes soars between 10,000 and 15,000, accounting for nearly 16 foxes per square mile.",
      "Around the country, their population ebbs and flows depending on the season, from 150,000 in the winter to around 400,000 during cub season, according to Terry Woods, who founded the fox removal company Fox-a-Gon, which advocates for the humane treatment of the animals.",
      "For decades, foxes have also captured the British imagination, appearing as the sly character Mr. Tod in Beatrix Potter's novels, and in Roald Dahl's \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And most recently, one even served as a memorable symbol for the \u201chot priest\u201d in the hit television show \"Fleabag\" by Phoebe Waller-Bridge.",
      "Though they are often seen boldly trotting along sidewalks and rummaging through residential bins, foxes have also roused strong reactions from onlookers, ranging from adoration to outright resentment.",
      "\u201cThey may appear cuddly and romantic, but foxes are also a pest and a menace, particularly in our cities,\u201d former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told BBC News in 2013, then as the mayor of London, when a fox horrified the British public after biting off a baby\u2019s finger.",
      "For years, foxes perfectly concealed their identity as the main culprits behind hundreds of cat mutilations in the south London suburb of Croydon, where the grisly carcasses strewn across streets and backyards led distressed residents to suspect that a deranged cat killer was on the loose until police realized what was happening in 2018.",
      "While some residents cherish their presence, hoping to charm the typically contact-averse creatures by trying to feed them, a series of British wildlife laws also gives foxes the protection and freedom to roam the United Kingdom\u2019s cities endlessly.",
      "\u201cFoxes are quite popular around this area; they are just virtually everywhere,\u201d said 31-year-old Ode Tomitoba, who works at the King\u2019s Cross Visitors Center.",
      "For Hanei Mokenen, 23, who manages a restaurant in King\u2019s Cross, news of the latest fox incursion came by way of a TikTok video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s King\u2019s Cross, anything can happen here,\u201d he said about the bustling commercial neighborhood in Central London, adding that he had occasionally seen a fox running around the area.",
      "But their stealth around the giant Google edifice had nonetheless taken Mokenen by surprise. \u201cHow the hell did they get inside? Security is strong in this area; it\u2019s not a place where you can just walk around,\u201d he said.",
      "The foxes\u2019 newfound home at Google\u2019s offices isn\u2019t the first time the animals have made themselves comfortable in London\u2019s skyscrapers. In 2011, a fox called Romeo was discovered living in The Shard, surviving on the food scraps left by construction workers.",
      "\u201cIt is a fairly common occurrence with the creatures being so adaptable,\u201d said Woods from Fox-a-Gon, who helped remove Romeo from the site by capturing him safely and releasing him back into the urban jungle.",
      "\u201cThey are such an adaptable animal that they can survive almost anywhere and overcome great hardships,\u201d he added."

      "More than 100 settlers on Wednesday evening entered the West Bank town of Kfar Malik, setting property ablaze and opening fire on Palestinians who tried to stop them, Najeb Rostom, head of the local council, said. Three Palestinians were killed after the military intervened. Israeli security forces arrested five settlers.",
      "Far-right Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has often defended Israelis accused of similar crimes, offered a rare condemnation of Sunday's violence. \"Attacking security forces, security facilities, and IDF soldiers who are our brothers, our protectors, is a red line, and must be dealt with in full severity. We are brothers,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid told Israel's Army radio that the riots were carried out by \"Jewish terrorists, gangs of criminals, who feel backed by the (governing) coalition.\"",
      "A hard-line supporter of Jewish settlements, Ben-Gvir was previously convicted in Israel of racist incitement and support for terrorist groups, and has called for the deportation of all Arab citizens from Israel. Though once widely shunned by Israel's politicians, Ben-Gvir's influence has grown and alongside a shift to the right in the country's electorate has further emboldened violence from extremist settlers in the West Bank.",
      "Footage on Israeli media showed dozens of young, religious men typically associated with \" hilltop youth,\" an extremist movement of Israeli settlers who occupy West Bank hilltops and have been accused of attacking Palestinians and their property. The footage showed security forces using stun grenades as dozens of settlers gathered around the military base just north of Ramallah. The Israeli military released photos of the infrastructure burned in the attack, which it said included \"systems that help thwart terrorist attacks and maintain security.\"",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Monday to \"eradicate this violence from the root,\" and implored the extremist settlers to remember that many of the security forces are exhausted reservists serving multiple rounds of duty.",
      "Over the past two years of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Palestinian residents in the West Bank have reported a major increase in Israeli checkpoints and delays across the territory. Israel, meanwhile, says threats from the West Bank against its citizens are on the rise.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war, and Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The West Bank is home to some 3 million Palestinians who live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, and 500,000 Jewish settlers. The international community overwhelmingly considers settlements illegal."

      "Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir posted on the office\u2019s official Mizan news agency website that those killed on Monday included staff, soldiers, prisoners and members of visiting families. It was not possible to independently verify the claim.",
      "The June 23 attack, the day before the ceasefire between Israel and Iran took hold, hit several prison buildings and prompted concerns from rights groups about the safety of the inmates.",
      "It remains unclear why Israel targeted the prison, but it came on a day when the Defense Ministry said it was attacking \u201cregime targets and government repression bodies in the heart of Tehran.\u201d",
      "The news of the prison attack was quickly overshadowed by an Iranian attack on a U.S. base in Qatar later that same day, which caused no casualties, and the announcement of the ceasefire.",
      "Jahangir did not break down the casualty figures but said the attack had hit the prison\u2019s infirmary, engineering building, judicial affairs and visitation hall, where visiting family members were killed and injured.",
      "On the day of the attack, New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran criticized Israel for striking the prison, seen as a symbol of the Iranian regime\u2019s repression of any opposition, saying it violated the principle of distinction between civilian and military targets.",
      "At the same time, the group said Iran was legally obligated to protect the prisoners held in Evin, and slammed authorities in Tehran for their \u201cfailure to evacuate, provide medical assistance or inform families\u201d following the attack.",
      "Jahangir said some of those injured were treated on site, while others were sent to hospitals.",
      "Iran had not previously announced any death figures, though on Saturday confirmed that top prosecutor Ali Ghanaatkar \u2014 whose prosecution of dissidents, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, led to widespread criticism by human rights groups \u2014 had been killed in the attack.",

More than 1,000 people were killed, including at least 417 civilians, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group.",
      "In retaliation, Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, but those that got through caused damage in many areas and killed 28 people.",
      "While both sides have been adhering to the truce, Iranian officials raised suspicions Sunday about whether Israel would continue to keep its word.",
      "Abdolrahim Mousavi, the chief of staff for Iran\u2019s armed forces, said in a conversation with Saudi Arabia\u2019s defense minister that the country is prepared if there were to be another surprise Israeli attack.",

    "summary": "The Yemeni island of Socotra was largely unspoiled, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense. Now it is threatened by climate change.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

      "Humanoid robots waddled, stumbled and occasionally face-planted their way through a 3-on-3 soccer tournament in Beijing on Saturday that looked more like the first day of little league than the rise of a robotic Lionel Messi.",
      "Pileups were frequent as players toppled over each other in slow-motion collisions, goals were left open, and defending appeared optional. Some robots hogged the ball, others struggled to stay upright, and two or three had to be loaded onto a stretcher and carried off the field.",
      "While the play was absurd, the tech powering it was anything but.",
      "Each team operated fully autonomously, driven by AI, with no human intervention or supervision \u2014 an impressive breakthrough somewhat masked by the slapstick spectacle playing out on the field.",
      "Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the child-sized robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with some halting agility. They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling, though some did require the help of biological humans, including one who was dragged off the field after tipping over near the goal.",
      "And beneath the bloopers is a country investing tens of billions of dollars and racing to extend its lead in the field of next-gen robotics.",
      "China\u2019s robotics market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 23% and reach $108 billion by 2028 \u2014 up from the $47 billion it currently invests, according to research published by Morgan Stanley. By 2050, China is expected to have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, far ahead of the U.S. projection of 77.7 million, the report added, noting these would likely be used for \u201crepetitive, simple, and structured work,\u201d like in factories.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming apparent that national support for \u2018embodied AI\u2019 may be far greater in China than in any other nation, driving continued innovation,\u201d said Sheng Zhong, Morgan Stanley\u2019s head of industrials research. \u201cIn our opinion, China\u2019s lead in AI-robotics may need to widen before rivals, including the U.S., pay closer attention.\u201d",
      "Sports is becoming a key part of China\u2019s push.",
      "In April, 21 humanoid robots recently competed alongside humans in a half-marathon in Beijing, though only six managed to finish. Saturday\u2019s soccer match also served as a preview for the upcoming 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games, which China will host in Beijing Aug. 15\u201317. The event will feature 11 robot sports, including gymnastics, track and field, and soccer.",
      "Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics \u2014 the company that supplied the robot players at Saturday\u2019s soccer tournament \u2014 said sports competitions are a testing ground for humanoid robots. Their successes and stumbles on the field help accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.",
      "He also explained that safety is a core concern about humanoid robots.",
      "\u201cIn the future, we may arrange for robots to play soccer with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,\u201d Cheng said, referring to a perceived risk that a heavy robot could fall on and injure a human athlete, for example.",
      "\u201cA robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn\u2019t matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe,\u201d he said.",
      "Ironically, China\u2019s humanoids may be more entertaining than their human counterparts.",
      "With the men\u2019s national team languishing at 94th in the FIFA rankings and likely to miss out on the next World Cup, the robots at least know how to put on a show \u2014 and score.",
      "In the final, Tsinghua University\u2019s THU Robotics defeated China Agricultural University\u2019s Mountain Sea team 5\u20133 to take the championship. No shortage of goals, and no complaints from the cheering crowd."

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "If Iran opts to pursue a clandestine nuclear weapons project, the regime would have to shore up its heavily compromised security, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

    "summary": "A jury in Australia began deliberations in the trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her husband's relatives by  serving them poisonous mushrooms.",
    "story": [
      "A sequestered jury in Australia began deliberations Monday in the triple murder trial of Erin Patterson, accused of killing her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "Three of Patterson's four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She is accused of attempting to murder the fourth, Heather's husband Ian Wilkinson, who was gravely ill but survived.",
      "During the nine-week Supreme Court trial in the state of Victoria, Patterson gave evidence in her own defense. The 50-year-old mother of two faces life in prison if convicted.",
      "Jury must decide if mushroom cook meant to kill",
      "It isn't disputed that Patterson served her guests the toxic mushrooms or that the meal killed them. But the jury must decide whether she meant for them to die.",
      "Prosecutors in the case, which has gripped Australia for two years, said the accused woman researched, foraged and served the mushrooms deliberately and lied to investigators to cover her tracks. Their case against Patterson included that she disposed of a food dehydrator after the fatal meal and reset her phone multiple times.",
      "The prosecution said she lied about having a dire medical diagnosis to ensure her guests attended the lunch, cooked individual pastries to avoid poisoning herself, and faked symptoms to make it look as though she fell ill, too.",
      "But Patterson's lawyers said the poisoning was a terrible accident caused by a pantry mix-up of store-bought and wild mushrooms, which she didn't know were death caps. The defense case was that Patterson wasn't as ill as the other diners because she induced vomiting after the meal due to an eating disorder.",
      "The accused lied to the police that she had never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator out of panic, her lawyers said. Patterson denied telling her lunch guests she had a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.",
      "Prosecutors offered no motive",
      "Justice Christopher Beale spent four days summarizing the case to jurors before their deliberations began, urging them not to be swayed by bias or prejudice, or by sympathy for the families of those who died. Patterson's lies, some of which she admitted during her evidence, could be used to assess her credibility but didn't mean she was guilty of murder, Justice Beale said.",
      "Prosecutors didn't offer a motive for the alleged killings and weren't required to. But they suggested a deteriorating relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, as well as her exasperation with her former in-laws, which she expressed to friends on social media months before the deaths.",
      "The defense said Erin Patterson had a positive and loving relationship with her lunch guests, who included her children's only living grandparents, and that she had no reason to kill them. Justice Beale highlighted in his summary of the case the fleeting and minor nature of the past disputes.",
      "Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal lunch but didn't go.",
      "Jurors will remain sequestered",
      "A 14-member jury heard the case, but 12 were selected by ballot Monday to decide the verdict. The jury will remain sequestered, meaning they will stay together in court-appointed accommodation until they reach a unanimous decision.",
      "Late Monday afternoon, court staff told reporters that jurors had finished deliberations for the day and would return to consider the case Tuesday. The jury is not permitted to return a verdict outside of the court's sitting hours and members are barred from discussing the case outside the jury room \u2014 even with each other.",
      "Sequestration is rare in Australia and reflects public and media fervor about the case, with several news outlets publishing live blogs that covered every moment of the trial for its more than two-month run. The lengthy fixture in the town of Morwell, Victoria, drew lines of people eager to watch proceedings each day."

      "HOVELTE, Denmark \u2014 Peering across a dense stretch of woodland outside of Denmark's capital with camouflage paint smeared across her face, 20-year-old Katrine scans the horizon for approaching threats.",
      "After nearly four months of military training, the young soldier and the rest of her unit spent early June completing their final exercises near the Danish army's barracks in Hovelte, 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "Katrine and other female soldiers, all of whom spoke to The Associated Press on June 11 on the condition that only their first names be used because of operational security, volunteered for military service earlier this year. Until now, that was the only way for women to be part of the armed forces.",
      "The Scandinavian country is seeking to increase the number of young people in the military by extending compulsory enlistment to women for the first time. Men and women can both still volunteer, and the remaining places will be filled by a gender-neutral draft lottery.",
      "\"In the situation the world is in now, it's needed,\" Katrine said. \"I think it's only fair and right that women participate equally with men.\"",
      "Under new rules passed by Denmark's parliament earlier in June, Danish women who turn 18 after Tuesday will be entered into the lottery system, on equal footing with their male compatriots. The change comes against a backdrop of Russian aggression and growing military investment across NATO countries.",
      "Russia's looming threat",
      "Even from the relative safety of Denmark, Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine casts its shadow. Lessons from the Ukrainian battlefields have even filtered down into their training.",
      "\"That makes it very real,\" Katrine said.",
      "Denmark's gender-parity reforms were originally outlined in 2024 as part of a major defense agreement. The program was originally expected to be implemented by early 2027, but has been brought forward to summer 2025.",
      "Col. Kenneth Str\u00f8m, head of the conscription program, told AP the move is based on \"the current security situation.\"",
      "\"They could take part in NATO collective deterrence,\" Str\u00f8m added. \"Raising the number of conscripts, that would simply lead to more combat power.\"",
      "Denmark, a nation of 6 million people, has about 9,000 professional troops. The new arrangement is expected to bring up to 6,500 annual conscripts by 2033, up from 4,700 last year.",
      "Under Danish law, all physically fit men over age 18 are called up for military service. But because there are usually enough volunteers, there's a lottery system so not all young men serve. Women, by contrast, could only volunteer previously, making up roughly a quarter of 2024's cohort.",
      "\"Some will probably be very disappointed being chosen to go into the military,\" Anne Sofie, part of Katrine's cohort of volunteers, said of the new female conscripts. \"Some will probably be surprised and like it a lot more than they think they would.\"",
      "The duration of service is also being extended from four to 11 months. Conscripts will first spend five months in basic training, followed by six months of operational service, plus additional lessons.",
      "Military buildup",
      "The move is part of a broader military buildup by the Nordic nation.",
      "In February, Denmark's government announced plans to bolster its military by setting up a $7 billion fund that it said would raise the country's defense spending to more than 3% of gross domestic product this year. Parts of the conscript program are being financed by the so-called Acceleration Fund.",
      "\"We see a sharpened security situation in Europe. We have the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We have focus on the Baltic countries, where Denmark is contributing a lot of soldiers. So, I think it's a general effort to strengthen the Danish defense,\" said researcher Rikke Haugegaard from the Royal Danish Defense College.",
      "But Haugegaard notes there are many challenges, from ill-fitting equipment and a lack of additional barracks, to potential cases of sexual harassment.",
      "\"For the next year or two, we will be building a lot of new buildings to accommodate all these people. So, it will be a gradual process,\" she added.",
      "In 2017, neighboring Sweden instituted a military draft for both men and women after its government spoke of a deteriorating security environment in Europe. Norway introduced its own law applying military conscription to both sexes in 2013."

      "\u201cWhat did these children do to them? What is their fault?\u201d said the children\u2019s grandmother, Suad Abu Teima, as others knelt to kiss their bloodied faces and wept. Some placed red flowers into the body bags.",
      "Also among the dead were 12 people near the Palestine Stadium in Gaza City, which was sheltering displaced people, and eight more in apartments, according to staff at Shifa Hospital. More than 20 bodies were taken to Nasser Hospital, according to health officials.",
      "A midday strike killed 11 people on a street in eastern Gaza City, and their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital. A strike on a gathering at the entrance to the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza killed two, according to Al-Awda hospital.",
      "Hopes for a ceasefire agreement in the coming week",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump says there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters on Friday, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.\u201d",
      "An official with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press that Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer will arrive in Washington next week for talks on a Gaza ceasefire, Iran and other subjects. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have been on again, off again since Israel broke the latest ceasefire in March, continuing its military campaign in Gaza and furthering the territory\u2019s dire humanitarian crisis. Some 50 hostages remain in Gaza, fewer than half believed to still be alive. They were among 251 hostages taken when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, sparking the 21-month war.",
      "Over 6,000 killed since latest ceasefire ended",
      "The war has killed over 56,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. It says more than half of the dead were women and children. It said the dead include 6,089 killed since the end of the latest ceasefire.",
      "Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas, accusing the militants of hiding among civilians because they operate in populated areas.",
      "There is hope among families of hostages that Trump\u2019s involvement in securing the recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran might lead to more pressure for a deal in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is riding a wave of public support for the Iran war and its achievements, and he could feel he has more space to move toward ending the war in Gaza, something his far-right governing partners oppose.",
      "Hamas has repeatedly said it is prepared to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war in Gaza. Netanyahu says he will end the war only once Hamas is disarmed and exiled, something the group has rejected.",
      "Hundreds have been killed while seeking food",
      "Meanwhile, hungry Palestinians are enduring a catastrophic situation in Gaza. After blocking all food for 2 1/2 months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.",
      "More than 500 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded while seeking food since the newly formed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began distributing aid in the territory about a month ago, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "Palestinian witnesses say Israeli troops have opened fire at crowds on roads heading toward the sites. The Israeli military says it has only fired warning shots and that it was investigating incidents in which civilians had been harmed while approaching the sites.",
      "Thousands of Palestinians walk for hours to reach the sites, moving through Israeli military zones.",
      "Separate efforts by the United Nations to distribute limited food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys."

      "The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda on Friday signed a peace deal facilitated by the U.S. to help end the decadeslong deadly fighting in eastern Congo while helping the U.S. government and American companies gain access to critical minerals in the region.",
      "\u201cToday, the violence and destruction comes to an end, and the entire region begins a new chapter of hope and opportunity, harmony, prosperity and peace,\u201d President Donald Trump told the foreign ministers of the two countries at a White House meeting.",
      "The agreement was signed earlier at the State Department\u2019s Treaty Room beneath a portrait of Colin Powell, the first African American to hold the job of top U.S. diplomat. There, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it \u201can important moment after 30 years of war.\u201d",
      "The Central African nation of Congo has been wracked by conflict with more than 100 armed groups, the most potent backed by Rwanda, that have killed millions since the 1990s.",
      "While the deal is seen as a turning point, analysts don\u2019t believe it will quickly end the fighting because the most prominent armed group says it does not apply to it. Many Congolese see it mainly as an opportunity for the U.S. to acquire critical minerals needed for much of the world\u2019s technology after their government reached out to Trump for support in fighting the rebels.",
      "Trump has pushed to gain access to such minerals at a time when the United States and China are actively competing for influence in Africa.",
      "Congo\u2019s Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner invoked the millions of victims of the conflict in signing the agreement with Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe. Both expressed optimism but stressed significant work still to do to end the fighting.",
      "\u201cSome wounds will heal, but they will never fully disappear,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThose who have suffered the most are watching. They are expecting this agreement to be respected, and we cannot fail them.\u201d",
      "Nduhungirehe noted the \u201cgreat deal of uncertainty\u201d because previous agreements were not put in place.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the road ahead will not be easy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the continued support of the United States and other partners, we believe that a turning point has been reached.\u201d",
      "They, along with Rubio, lauded the support of the Gulf Arab nation of Qatar in facilitating the agreement, which Doha has been working on for months at the request of the U.S. and others.",
      "The agreement has provisions on territorial integrity, prohibition of hostilities and the disengagement, disarmament and conditional integration of non-state armed groups.",
      "Asked in the Oval Office about violations of the agreement, Trump said he didn\u2019t think that would happen but also warned of \u201cvery severe penalties, financial and otherwise,\u201d if it did.",
      "The peace deal is not likely to end the conflict quickly",
      "The Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group is the most prominent armed group in the conflict, and its major advance early this year left bodies on the streets. With 7 million people displaced in Congo, the United Nations has called it \u201cone of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth.\u201d",
      "Congo hopes the U.S. will provide it with the security support needed to fight the rebels and possibly get them to withdraw from the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, and from the entire region where Rwanda is estimated to have up to 4,000 troops. Rwanda has said that it\u2019s defending its territorial interests and not supporting M23.",
      "M23 rebels have suggested that the agreement won\u2019t be binding for them. The rebel group hasn\u2019t been directly involved in the planned peace deal, although it has been part of other ongoing peace talks.",
      "Corneille Nangaa, leader of Congo River Alliance \u2014 known by its French acronym AFC \u2014 which includes M23, told The Associated Press in March that direct peace talks with Congo can only be held if the country acknowledges their grievances and that \u201canything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us.\u201d",
      "An M23 spokesperson, Oscar Balinda, echoed that to the AP this week.",
      "Nduhungirehe pointed to separate talks happening in Qatar that are meant to get both Congo and the M23 rebels to agree among themselves how they will end the fighting. He also said Rwanda agreed to lift its \u201cdefensive measures.\u201d It was not clear if he meant withdrawing the troops that Rwanda has said are defending its territorial interests.",
      "Rwanda also has been accused of exploiting eastern Congo\u2019s minerals, used in smartphones, advanced fighter jets and much more. Rwanda has denied any involvement, while analysts say that might make it difficult for Rwanda not to be involved in the region.",
      "The deal is at the heart of the U.S. government\u2019s push to counter China in Africa. For many years, Chinese companies have been a key player in Congo\u2019s minerals sector. Chinese cobalt refineries, which account for a majority of the global supply, rely heavily on Congo.",
      "What the US role looks like in ending the conflict",
      "Congo\u2019s foreign minister said the U.S. has proven to be a \u201creliable partner\u201d during the peace process and on other issues in relations between the two countries.",
      "\u201cSo there is no doubt in this moment, if you want, when it comes to the credibility of the U.S. as a partner, be it for a peace process, where we have signed a very important agreement today, or for investment from the U.S.,\u201d Wagner told the AP in an interview Friday evening.",
      "Analysts say the U.S. government\u2019s commitment might depend on how much access it has to the minerals being discussed under separate negotiations between the American and Congolese governments.",
      "The mostly untapped minerals are estimated to be worth as much as $24 trillion by the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
      "Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol, called the deal a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d but said it could \u201cin no way eliminate all the issues of the conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current draft agreement ignores war crimes and justice for victims by imposing a partnership between the victim and the aggressor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seems like a trigger-happy proposition and cannot establish lasting peace without justice and reparation.\u201d",
      "In Congo\u2019s North Kivu province, the hardest hit by the fighting, some believe that the peace deal will help resolve the violence but warn justice must still be served for an enduring peace.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Americans should be trusted 100%,\u201d said Hope Muhinuka, an activist from the province. \u201cIt is up to us to capitalize on all we have now as an opportunity.\u201d",
      "The conflict can be traced to the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, where Hutu militias killed between 500,000 and 1 million ethnic Tutsi, as well as moderate Hutus and Twa, Indigenous people. When Tutsi-led forces fought back, nearly 2 million Hutus crossed into Congo, fearing reprisals.",
      "Rwandan authorities have accused the Hutus who fled of participating in the genocide and alleged that elements of the Congolese army protected them. They have argued that the militias formed by a small fraction of the Hutus are a threat to Rwanda\u2019s Tutsi population.",
      "Since then, the ongoing conflict in east Congo has killed 6 million people, in attacks, famines and unchecked disease outbreaks stemming from the fighting."

      "Large crowds of mourners dressed in black lined streets in Iran\u2019s capital Tehran as the country held a funeral on Saturday for top military commanders, nuclear scientists and some of the civilians killed during this month\u2019s aerial war with Israel.",
      "At least 16 scientists and 10 senior commanders were among those mourned at the funeral, according to state media, including armed forces chief Major General Mohammad Bagheri, Revolutionary Guards commander General Hossein Salami, and Guards Aerospace Force chief General Amir Ali Hajizadeh.",
      "Their coffins were driven into Tehran\u2019s Azadi Square adorned with their photos and national flags, as crowds waved flags and some reached out to touch the caskets and throw rose petals onto them. State-run Press TV showed an image of ballistic missiles on display.",

      "There was no immediate statement from Khamenei, who has not appeared publicly since the conflict began. In past funerals, he led prayers over the coffins of senior commanders ahead of public ceremonies broadcast on state television.",
      "Israel launched the air war on June 13, attacking Iranian nuclear facilities and killing top military commanders as well as civilians in the worst blow to the Islamic Republic since the 1980s war with Iraq.",
      "Iran retaliated with barrages of missiles on Israeli military sites, infrastructure and cities. The United States entered the war on June 22 with strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Israel, the only Middle Eastern country widely believed to have nuclear weapons, said it aimed to prevent Tehran from developing its own nuclear weapons.",
      "Iran denies having a nuclear weapons program. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has said it has \u201cno credible indication\u201d of an active, coordinated weapons program in Iran.",
      "Bagheri, Salami and Hajizadeh were killed on June 13, the first day of the war. Bagheri was being buried at the Behesht Zahra cemetery outside Tehran mid-afternoon on Saturday. Salami and Hajizadeh were due to be buried on Sunday.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that he would consider bombing Iran again, while Khamenei, who has appeared in two pre-recorded video messages since the start of the war, has said Iran would respond to any future U.S. attack by striking U.S. military bases in the Middle East.",
      "A senior Israeli military official said on Friday that Israel had delivered a \u201cmajor blow\u201d to Iran\u2019s nuclear project. On Saturday, Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards said in a statement that Israel and the U.S. \u201cfailed to achieve their stated objectives\u201d in the war.",
