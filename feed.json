      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Misty Copeland hangs up her pointe shoes Wednesday, putting a final exclamation point on a trailblazing career in which she became an ambassador for diversity in the very white world of ballet \u2014 and a crossover star far beyond.",
      "Copeland will be feted in grand style as American Ballet Theatre devotes a gala evening to her retirement after 25 years with the company. Copeland joined ABT as a teenager and became, a decade ago, the first Black female principal dancer in its 75-year history.",
      "In a way, the gala will be both a return and a departure for Copeland. She'll be dancing with the company for the first time in five years. During that time, Copeland has been raising a young son with her husband.",
      "She's also been continuing her career as an author \u2014 the second volume of her \u201cBunheads\u201d series appeared in September \u2014 and working to increase diversity in the dance world with her namesake foundation, including \u201cBe Bold,\u201d an afterschool program designed for young children of color.",
      "But Copeland decided to dust off the pointe shoes so she could have one last spin on the ABT stage \u2014 including a duet as Juliet, one of the most passionate roles in ballet. Though she has not closed the door on dancing altogether, it\u2019s clear an era is ending.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years at ABT, and I think it\u2019s time,\u201d Copeland, 43, told The Associated Press in an interview in June, when she announced her retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to move to the next stage.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve become the person that I am today, and have all the opportunities I have today, because of ballet, (and) because of American Ballet Theatre. I feel like this is me saying \u2018thank you\u2019 to the company. So it\u2019s a farewell. (But) it won\u2019t be the end of me dancing. \u2026 Never say never.\u201d",
      "The evening at Lincoln Center\u2019s David H. Koch Theater will be streamed live to nearby Alice Tully Hall across the plaza, with attendance free to the public \u2014 another sign of Copeland's unique brand of fame in the dance world.",

After a stint in the junior company, Copeland joined ABT as a member of the corps de ballet in April 2001, becoming a soloist six years later.",
      "In June 2015, Copeland was promoted to principal dancer. Unlike other promotions, which are announced quietly, Copeland's was announced at a news conference \u2014 a testament to her celebrity. Only days before, she\u2019d made a triumphant New York debut in \u201cSwan Lake\u201d in the starring role of Odette/Odile, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic crowd to the Metropolitan Opera House.",
      "In the AP interview, Copeland acknowledged that it\u2019s striking that when she leaves ABT, there will no longer be a Black female principal dancer at the company (on the male side, acclaimed dancer Calvin Royal III was promoted to principal in 2020).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely concerning,\u201d Copeland said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve just gotten to a place in my career where there\u2019s only so much I can do on a stage. There\u2019s only so much that visual representation \u2026 can do. I feel like it\u2019s the perfect timing for me to be stepping into a new role, and hopefully still shaping and shifting the ballet world and culture.\u201d",

      "The Scharf Collection has its roots in a collection started more than a century ago by Otto Gerstenberg, who led a Berlin life insurance company. It's now in the hands of Gerstenberg's great-grandson, Ren\u00e9 Scharf, and his wife, Christiane, who have expanded it further into contemporary art.",
      "The roughly 150 works going on show this week at Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie range in time from the early 19th century, with plates from Spanish master Francisco de Goya's series \u201cThe Disasters of War\u201d and \u201cLa Tauromaquia,\u201d to modern abstract works by German artists Katharina Grosse and Anselm Reyle. Compositions by Sam Francis and Jasper Johns bring an American element to the collection.",
      "\u201cWe go from Goya to Grosse,\u201d Ren\u00e9 Scharf said as the exhibition was presented Wednesday. He said that he has a particular passion for impressionism, cubism and contemporary art, and hopes visitors who see Grosse's shimmering pink and blue \u201cNo title\u201d at the end of the show will see a connection to Claude Monet's impressionist \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d from nearly a century earlier.",
      "At the heart of the collection are works by many of the biggest names in French art of the past two centuries. Visitors progress from the romantic paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix to the realist work of Gustave Courbet and the caricatures of Honor\u00e9 Daumier, including a series of busts of French lawmakers by the latter.",
      "One of Claude Monet's earlier, realist works, \u201cFarmyard in Chailly,\" is displayed alongside later impressionist paintings such as \u201cSteep Cliffs near Dieppe\u201d and one of his \u201cWaterloo Bridge\u201d series. There are works on paper and canvas by Auguste Renoir and Paul C\u00e9zanne, complemented by nudes and dancers by Edgar Degas.",
      "Two of Pierre Bonnard's major works are prominently displayed \u2014 the lively and playful \u201cPlace Clichy,\u201d depicting a Paris square close to his studio, and \u201cThe Large Bathtub,\u201d portraying the artist's wife. They're shown close to pieces by his close friend Henri Matisse as the exhibition heads toward the cubism and the modern day with work from Pablo Picasso, Fernand L\u00e9ger and others.",

There are lithographs from his \u201cElles\u201d series, based on his observations of sex workers in everyday poses, and posters advertising stars of concert cafes and variety theaters.",
      "Scharf said that, after the Alte Nationalgalerie approached him about showing the collection, \u201cwe asked ourselves what happens if we do nothing? Then maybe 30, 40 or 50 people per year will see the collection and only a very small part of it, because we can't hang everything at home.\u201d",

      "Universal Pictures says Sunday that \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has topped the North American box office with an estimated $26.5 million in ticket sales",
      "The horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d topped the North American box office charts this weekend with $26.5 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. Not only did it surpass the original's $23.6 million debut, it's a much-needed win for Blumhouse after a string of disappointments this year like \u201cM3GAN 2.0.\u201d",
      "Though \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d opened in line with expectations, moviegoing in October continues to be slow \u2014 down about 11% from last year, according to Comscore. The overall box office is still up about 4% compared with last year, but a big blockbuster hit that could spark more momentum might not arrive until late November or December.",
      "Universal Pictures released \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d in 3,411 theaters in North America on a wave of good reviews. Coming four years after the original, the sequel sees the return of filmmaker Scott Derrickson, as well as stars Ethan Hawke and Mason Thames. Opening weekend audiences were 63% between the ages of 18 and 34, according to exit polls, and the biggest demographic was Hispanics, making up 39% of ticket buyers while Caucasians accounted for 35%.",
      "With an additional $15.5 million from 71 international territories, \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d had a $42 million worldwide launch against a reported $30 million production budget.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic opening,\u201d said Jim Orr, who heads Universal\u2019s domestic distribution. \u201cOur great partners in Scott Derrickson and Blumhouse once again took this property and crafted an unbelievably haunting, chilling story that audiences just simply couldn\u2019t get enough of.\u201d",
      "The first \u201cBlack Phone\u201d was a bit of a sleeper hit for Universal and Blumhouse in 2021 as cinemas were beginning to come back to life after COVID shutdowns. By the end of its run, it had earned more than $161 million worldwide against an $18 million budget.",
      "Blumhouse has had a rocky 2025, with a handful of duds including \u201cWolf Man\u201d and \u201cThe Woman in the Yard.\u201d But the once impenetrable horror hitmaker could be on the upswing again with a \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d sequel coming in December. The first movie earned nearly $300 million worldwide.",
      "The horror genre in general has soared to record-breaking heights this year, with hits like \u201cWeapons\u201d and the multi-genre \u201cSinners,\" generating over $1.2 billion for the industry, noted Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends.",
      "\u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was also the only film to really break through this weekend, despite a slew of options playing in wide release including the R-rated Seth Rogen, Aziz Ansari and Keanu Reeves comedy \u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in 2,990 locations to $6.2 million, and the expansion of the Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which made $1.6 million from 1,238 theaters. Also new in theaters is Guillermo del Toro\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d although Netflix does not report box office grosses.",
      "\u201cTron: Ares\u201d fell about 67% to $11.1 million in its second weekend in theaters, which was enough to snag second place on the charts. Globally it has now earned $103 million.",
      "\u201cGood Fortune,\u201d which opened in third place, had mostly positive reviews on its side, but Ansari's comedy with a side of social commentary did not drum up a lot of enthusiasm in its first weekend. With a B+ CinemaScore, though, it likely has a better chance in the coming weeks than the campus drama \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d which got a very poor C- score.",
      "\u201cThis is a quintessential October for movies, meaning this is not a hotbed of box office blockbusters,\u201d said Dergarabedian. \u201cBut the marketplace is flush with titles. This is awards season; this is where you have a lot of auteur driven films, edgier films. Collectively these don\u2019t generate a ton of box office, but there\u2019s the currency of goodwill created with movie fans.\u201d",
      "Next weekend audiences will get another batch of awards-hopefuls, including Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s latest Emma Stone collaboration \u201cBugonia\u201d and the Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere,\u201d starring \u201cThe Bear\u2019s\u201d Jeremy Allen White.",

      "San Francisco (AP) \u2014 A Northern California aquarium has raised more than $2 million for sea otter conservation in just two days. All it took was Taylor Swift wearing a vintage T-shirt.",
      "Swift wore a vintage Monterey Bay Aquarium otter conservation T-shirt in a release party movie for her new \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d album, sending her ardent fans on a quest to buy the shirt last produced in the 1990s. After the aquarium was flooded with calls about buying the T-shirt showing two otters floating on their back, it decided to re-release the garment Thursday as part of a special campaign to raise $1.3 million, a nod to Swift\u2019s favorite number, said Liz MacDonald, the aquarium\u2019s director of content strategy.",
      "The aquarium met and surpassed its goal to raise the funds for its sea otter conservation program in less than eight hours, averaging about $100,000 in sales every 15 minutes, MacDonald said. Donors who give at least $65.13 to its newest fundraising campaign to help injured and orphan otters will be mailed a T-shirt, MacDonald said.",
      "\u201cWe definitely had a little Taylor Swift dance party in the office yesterday afternoon when we hit the goal,\u201d she said.",
      "The aquarium began accepting back-orders and by Friday afternoon it had raised more than $2 million, according to its website.",
      "How Swift acquired the T-Shirt that was last produced more than 32 years ago \u2014 when she was just 3 years old \u2014 remains a mystery.",
      "She and fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce have been documented visiting nearby Carmel, but MacDonald said the aquarium is not aware of the couple having been in their shop.",
      "MacDonald said the staff has had fun speculating about Swift's interest in the T-shirt.",
      "When Taylor announced the release of her new album on Kelce\u2019s podcast \"New Heights\" a couple of weeks ago, the couple had a little banter about how he loves otters and loves sending her videos of the furry sea creatures.",
      "\u201cOne of my favorite theories is that we have a sea otter on our exhibit whose name is Opal and she was named by the fans through an online poll, and I wonder if Taylor Swift may have been one of the people that voted for the name Opal,\u201d MacDonald said, adding that opal is Kelce\u2019s birthstone and that Opalite is the name of one of Swift\u2019s songs.",
      "Whatever the reason, the aquarium and Liberty Graphics, an employee-owned company printing the T-shirts, are reveling in the moment.",

      "Also among them: Rappers Kodak Black and Ty Dolla $ign's longtime kindred spirit YG. (Ty Dolla $ign and YG have worked together for a number of years, certainly going back to 2010's \u201cToot It & Boot It.\") For his latest album, the trio teamed up for \u201cSMILE BODY PRETTY FACE.\u201d It was one of the last songs to make \u201cTycoon,\u201d says Ty Dolla $ign, \u201cBut when we started messing with the beat. I was like, \u2018This has got to be YG.\u2019\u201d",
      "There's a romantic element to the song \u2014 with some of his explicitly sexual posturing. The same can be said about the lead single to \u201cTycoon,\u201d \u201cAll In,\u201d where Ty Dolla $ign's rich baritone considers devotion to a partner. \u201cThey say love don\u2019t cost a thing,\u201d he swoons on the chorus. \u201cAnd if it did, I\u2019d go all in.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm always loving something,\u201d he says. \u201cIt hasn't all the way worked out for me yet.\u201d Love, then, is still a constant source of inspiration \u2014 enriched by the song's sample of Wayne Wonders\u2019 2002 reggae fusion track \u201cNo Letting Go.\u201d",
      "For Ty Dolla $ign, this new era means being a business \u201cTycoon\u201d as well. He's taken on his fair share of industry endeavors \u2014 like launching a label, EZMNY, with Motown Records executive Shawn Barron \u2014 and experiencing immediate success with its first signing, the R&B upstart Leon Thomas. His single, \u201cMutt,\u201d hit No. 11 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.",
      "Thomas told AP earlier this year about working with Ty Dolla $ign: \u201cI was around some epic legends in the field, and I feel like the best teacher is experience.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy goal there, with EZMNY, is to give the real artists a chance. Myself, I didn\u2019t make it until I was 27 and I was always good. I was always making music,\u201d Ty Dolla $ign says. \u201cAnd I just wanted to reach back to people that are actually great.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be a comeback in R&B very soon,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe're talking Leon specifically.\u201d",

      "With both sides showing no signs of movement, it\u2019s unclear how long the stalemate will last \u2014 even as hundreds of thousands of federal workers will miss another paycheck in the coming days and states are sounding warnings that key federal programs will soon lapse completely. And the meeting at the White House appears unlikely, for now, to lead to a bipartisan resolution as Senate Republicans are dug in and Trump has followed their lead.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s ready to get involved on having the discussion\u201d about extending the subsidies, said Senate Republican leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Monday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think they are prepared to do that until (Democrats) open up the government.\u201d",
      "While Capitol Hill remains at a standstill, the effects of the shutdown are worsening. Federal workers are set to miss additional paychecks amid total uncertainty about when they might eventually get paid. Government services like the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, and Head Start preschool programs that serve needy families are facing potential cutoffs in funding. On Monday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers. The Federal Aviation Administration has reported air controller shortages and flight delays in cities across the United States.",
      "Still, there has been little urgency in Washington as each side believes the other will eventually cave.",
      "\u201cOur position remains the same, we want to end the shutdown as soon as we can and fix the ACA premium crisis that looms over 20 million hardworking Americans,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Monday, referring to the expanded Affordable Care Act subsidies that expire in December.",
      "Schumer called the White House meeting a \u201cpep rally\u201d and said it was \u201cshameful\u201d that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has kept the House out of town during the shutdown.",
      "Members of both parties acknowledge that as the shutdown drags on, it is becoming less likely every day that Congress will be able to either extend the subsidies or fund the government through the regular appropriations process. The House GOP bill that Senate Democrats have now rejected 11 times would only keep the government open through Nov. 21.",
      "Thune on Monday hinted that Republicans may propose a longer extension of current funding instead of passing individual spending bills if the shutdown doesn\u2019t end soon. Congress would need to pass an extension beyond Nov. 21, he said, \u201cif not something on a much longer-term basis.\u201d",
      "Democrats are focused on Nov. 1, when next year\u2019s enrollment period for the ACA coverage begins and millions of people will sign up for their coverage without the expanded subsidy help that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once those sign-ups begin, they say, it would be much harder to restore the subsidies even if they did have a bipartisan compromise.",

      "More women are defying traditional beauty standards and finding empowerment by going without hair on their heads",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cBeing bald is sexy. It\u2019s an attitude. It\u2019s a luxury. It\u2019s a lifestyle.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s how Brennan Nevada Johnson, who shaved her head voluntarily 14 years ago, opens the video podcast she launched last November to celebrate the advantages of choosing a bald look.",
      "Sensuous, self-assured and glamorous are not the adjectives typically assigned to women with shorn hair. For centuries, many cultures have viewed long hair as a symbol of femininity, health and fertility. But more women are defying that traditional beauty standard and finding empowerment by baring their heads.",
      "\u201cOnce you do it, it brings all this confidence into your life,\u201d Johnson, 34, said. \u201cWhenever you see someone who\u2019s bald and not wearing a wig, just know that they have fully embraced themselves, and I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s really challenging to do.\"",
      "Her initial decision to go baldheaded was practical. Johnson played competitive volleyball in college and found the sweating she did on the court affected the expensive hair relaxing treatments she often had done. Once she started shaving off her hair, though, she was hooked. She was relieved to save money on salon trips.",
      "Johnson now owns a New York public relations firm. \u201cBald and Buzzed with Brennan,\u201d the video podcast she posts on YouTube, was an attempt to fill a void in social media content that affirmed bald people, especially women. She says she always thought baldness was sexy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a fashion statement, and it\u2019s a really powerful look,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Other women without hair, whether voluntarily or due to medical conditions, also have sought ways to support each other, attending conferences, joining \u201cbaldie\u201d groups and swapping grooming and scalp care tips.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole community of us out there,\u201d said Dash Lopez, a content creator who posts a weekly video series of her shaving routine called \u201cFresh Cut Friday.\u201d \u201cWe need to talk about it because we do find comfort and empowerment and beauty in what some people think is weird.\u201d",
      "Lopez said members of her family praised the long curly hair she had growing up. Some of her friends played with different hair colors and styles, but Lopez said she didn't have the same freedom. And she didn't enjoy detangling her hair or spending long afternoons at the salon.",
      "As soon as she turned 18 and could get a haircut without permission, she chopped her locks into a pixie cut. Then she shaved it all off during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel powerful in the sense that I\u2019m able to detach from the things that people place so much emphasis on,\u201d Lopez, 29, said. \u201cI\u2019m not sitting here planning, \u2018Oh my gosh, when am I going to get my next color appointment done? That\u2019s gonna cost me $300. Oh my gosh. I\u2019ve got to get my hair done before I go to this event.\u2019\u201d",
      "Lopez signed a contract with a modeling agency in 2020, a time when brands wanted to showcase diversity, she said. Back then, being bald worked for her professionally.",
      "\u201cThere was an appreciation for quirks and if you had a gap in your tooth, if you had a bald head, if you had a face full of freckles, that\u2019s what casting directors were looking for,\u201d Lopez said.",
      "She noticed the tide shifting last year, when her bookings for modeling jobs decreased. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, the odds were stacked against me in the modeling world,\" Lopez said. \"I was 5\u2032 4\u2033, 5\u2032 5\u2033 on paper, no hair.\u201d",
      "A client suggested she wear wigs to land more work. Lopez did not want to do that or grow out her hair. Her modeling contract ended. Since then, she has shared glimpses of her life as a bald woman on Instagram and TikTok, where some of her videos have been watched millions of times.",

      "Then she came across a group called The Baldie Movement on Facebook. \u201cThe ladies just really inspired me,\u201d Flores, 47, said. \u201cThey really did help to encourage me and give me strength, ... and they were just so confident.\u201d",
      "She eventually decided to stop wearing wigs and embrace being bald in 2015, after a romantic breakup. \u201cI was tired of lying. I felt like I was hiding something. I felt like I wasn\u2019t myself,\u201d she said.",

      "Soumaoro, 27, said that after she shaved her head, her mother told her that most men wouldn't want to marry a woman with no hair. She focuses instead on the compliments she's received while out in public, including \u201cYou wear it with confidence\u201d and \u201cYour face is gorgeous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing bald, it\u2019s like a boost of confidence out of nowhere,\u201d said Soumaoro, who cuts her hair every Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s like a new skin, a new layer, a new personality. I just feel fresh. Like I was born again.\u201d",
      "She also hikes on Sundays, savoring the feeling of cold breezes on her scalp. \u201cHaving that connection with Earth, it feels amazing,\u201d Soumaoro said. \u201cI feel like I can hear everything more clearly. It\u2019s like I have a clear mindset when my head is bald.\u201d",
      "Tiffany Michael Thomas, an Atlanta-based performer who goes by the stage name Amor Lauren, shaved her head in a show of support when her mother was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer.",

      "\u201cOnce I began to really embrace it, it just made me feel like I was unstoppable,\u201d Thomas, 37, said. \"There\u2019s nothing that I have to hide behind anymore. ... It forced me to deal with all of my insecurities.\u201d",
      "If you\u2019re thinking about shaving your head, don\u2019t hesitate, Thomas advises. Women tell her they\u2019re concerned that their head isn\u2019t the right shape, or they have a lump or a scar. \u201cDo it without thought,\u201d she said. \u201cDo it scared. Everything in life, just do it scared. The best way to get through that fear is to actually do it.\u201d",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",
      "Today, 62-year-old Mosoeunyane leads a peer support group in her village, Ha Koloboi. Neighbors ask for advice and trust her with their green medical booklets, where they record medical history, viral load, symptoms and medications.",
      "Lately, the group mostly worries \u2014 about the future, losing medication access, getting sick again.",
      "\u201cThis has been the most difficult time for me,\u201d Mosoeunyane said.",
      "Many in Mosoeunyane\u2019s group wish Trump himself could hear their concerns. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision is already translating into real life,\u201d said Mateboho Talitha Fusi, Mosoeunyane\u2019s friend and neighbor.",
      "The worries span Lesotho society: from rural to urban, low to middle income, patients to officials. Many Basotho \u2013 as people in Lesotho are known \u2013 feel hopeless.",
      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services. Workers set up tents outside bars with condoms and the prevention medication known as PreP. Teams delivered medication directly to patients who wouldn\u2019t step foot in public health clinics, for fear of discrimination.",
      "Lechela\u2019s group earned the trust of the skeptics and the stubborn. All that work is gone, she fears. She still gets calls from people desperate for services and refills. She does what she can, and their stories haunt her.",
      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",
      "\u201cI have to put bread on the table,\u201d said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because her husband, who works in South Africa, wouldn\u2019t approve of her sex work. She can\u2019t miss a day of factory work to wait in line at a clinic.",
      "Visiting the woman at home, all Lechela could do was demonstrate how to use a female condom \u2013 and hope her clients wouldn\u2019t notice or protest.",
      "With nearly all community groups and local organizations like Lechela\u2019s closed and 1,500 health workers fired, some Lesotho officials see overdue signs that their nation and others must stop relying on international aid.",

      "\u201cLesotho\u2019s made progress one should not overlook; at the same time, it is still a heavily burdened country with HIV.\u201d",
      "Chikukwa was optimistic about the September announcement by the U.S. State Department \u2014 which took over implementation of foreign aid programs \u2014 that it would temporarily reinstate some lifesaving programs, including one to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",
      "\u201cWe lost some ground,\u201d she said. \u201cThe uncertainty was very high; now there is some hope.\u201d",
      "But it\u2019s not clear how much the U.S. bridge programs will \u201cclose the gap,\u201d added Chikukwa, even as she\u2019s leaving Lesotho. Her role was eliminated because of the aid cuts. The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",
      "Lesotho funded only 12% of its own health budget. The U.S. and other foreign donors provided the rest. USAID alone accounted for 34% of the budget; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26%, according to a May presentation to lawmakers.",
      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",
      "Lesotho regularly gave patients a six- to 12-month supply to help its mobile population, including many who work in South Africa, stick with treatment. But when the cuts were announced, some nurses gave out even more drugs than usual.",
      "Nurses were told to cut back. Patients grew alarmed.",
      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa. Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",
      "The system propped up by foreign aid was always meant to be temporary. But public health experts say the shift to Lesotho and other countries becoming self-reliant should have been gradual.",
      "At the United Nations General Assembly last month, Lesotho Prime Minister Samuel Matekane acknowledged the threat posed by declining foreign aid but fell short of pointing fingers. He said Lesotho is mobilizing domestic resources to address gaps.",
      "But Catherine Connor, of the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, emphasized that \u201cany step backward creates a risk of resurgence.\u201d",
      "In the 16 years her organization has worked in Lesotho, HIV transmission from mother to child dropped to about 6% from nearly 18%. Lesotho\u2019s government should get credit, Connor said, but her group and others were key in targeting children\u2019s treatment and prevention.",
      "Since 2008, Connor\u2019s group received more than $227 million from the U.S. for Lesotho programming, USASpending.gov data shows. This fiscal year, about half the work it planned has been terminated.",

      "Most at risk, she and others stressed, are children. As of late August, half of PEPFAR funding targeted toward children in Lesotho was terminated, and 54% of infants tested for HIV before their first birthday in fiscal year 2024 were evaluated by programs that had been cut, according to Foundation for AIDS Research data.",
      "\u201cWhen a child never gets diagnosed, it feels like a missed opportunity,\u201d Connor said. \u201cWhen a child who was receiving treatment stops getting treatment, it feels like a crime against humanity.\u201d",

But cuts to federal staff and programs that address chronic disease could endanger that progress, according to a new report released Thursday.",
      "Nineteen states had obesity rates of 35% or higher in 2024, down from 23 states the year before, according to an analysis of the latest data collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC data was analyzed by the nonprofit group Trust for America's Health.",
      "The group\u2019s analysis follows a CDC report last year that found that the overall rate of obesity in the U.S. is high but holding steady, affecting about 40% of the population.",

      "MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay -- MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) \u2014 Uruguay\u2019s senate passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia on Wednesday, putting the South American nation among a handful of other countries where seriously ill patients can legally obtain help to end their lives.",
      "It makes Uruguay the first country in predominantly Catholic Latin America to allow euthanasia via legislation. Colombia and Ecuador have decriminalized the practice through Supreme Court decisions.",
      "In Chile, left-wing President Gabriel Boric recently revived a push for the approval of an euthanasia bill long stalled in the Senate.",

      "\u201cPublic opinion is asking us to take this on,\u201d Sen. Patricia Kramer of Uruguay's governing leftist coalition told lawmakers in the country's capital of Montevideo.",
      "The law, which moved forward in fits and starts over the last five years, cleared its final hurdle on Wednesday as 20 out of 31 senators voted in favor. The lower house approved the bill in August with a large majority. All that's left is for the government to implement the regulations.",
      "During the debate, senators from the ruling Broad Front coalition delivered impassioned defenses of the right to die, comparing the euthanasia movement to the legalization of divorce and same-sex marriage.",

Daniel Borbonet said after quoting testimony from Uruguayan patients with irreversible medical conditions.",
      "Most opposition to euthanasia in Uruguay came from the Catholic Church. Before the vote, Daniel Sturla, the archbishop of Montevideo, called on Uruguayans \u201cto defend the gift of life and to remember that every person deserves to be cared for, accompanied and supported until the end.\u201d",
      "But secularization has eroded resistance to the practice in this country of 3.5 million people, which bans any mention of God in oaths of office and calls Christmas \u201cFamily Day.\u201d",
      "Officials hailed the law's passage as reinforcing Uruguay's reputation as among the most socially liberal nations in the region. The country was first in the world to legalize marijuana for recreational use and passed pioneering legislation allowing same-sex marriage and abortion over a decade ago.",

      "Unlike laws in U.S. states, Australia and New Zealand restricting euthanasia to those with a life expectancy of no more than six months or a year, Uruguay sets no time limits. It also not does require a waiting period, and allows anyone suffering from an incurable illness that causes \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d to seek assisted death, even if their diagnosis is not terminal.",
      "Uruguay requires that those seeking euthanasia to be mentally competent.",
      "Although the law does not outright ban euthanasia for those with mental conditions like depression, it requires that patients get two doctors to rule that they are psychologically fit enough to make the decision.",
      "Unlike Belgium, Colombia and the Netherlands, Uruguay will not allow euthanasia for minors.",

      "The Vatican is expected to soon announce that it will return a few dozen artifacts sought by Indigenous communities in Canada",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 The Vatican is expected to soon announce that it will return a few dozen artifacts sought by Indigenous communities in Canada as part of its reckoning with the Catholic Church\u2019s troubled role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The items, including an Inuit kayak, are part of the Vatican Museum\u2019s ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural artifacts taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \u201cIn the case where you can return things, where it\u2019s necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\u201d",
      "The Canadian Catholic Conference of Bishops said Wednesday it has been working with Indigenous groups on returning the items to their \u201coriginating communities.\u201d It said it expected the Holy See to announce the return. Vatican and Canadian officials said they expected an announcement in the coming weeks, and that the items could arrive on Canadian soil before the end of the year.",
      "The Globe and Mail newspaper first reported on the progress in the restitution negotiations.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens that was a highlight of that year\u2019s Holy Year.",
      "The Vatican insists the items were \u201cgifts\u201d to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church\u2019s global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government\u2019s policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d",
      "The return of the items will follow the \u201cchurch-to-church\u201d model the Vatican used in 2023, when it gave its Parthenon Marbles to the Orthodox Christian Church in Greece. The three fragments were described by the Vatican as a \u201cdonation\u201d to the Orthodox church, not a state-to-state repatriation to the Greek government.",
      "In this case, the Vatican is expected to hand over the items to the Canadian bishops conference, with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities, a Canadian official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are not concluded.",

      "The official declined to say how many items were under negotiation or who decided what would be returned, but said the total numbered \u201ca few dozen.\u201d",
      "The aim is to get the items back this year, the official said, noting the 2025 Jubilee celebrating hope, and the centenary of the 1925 Holy Year that was the reason for the items to be brought to Rome in the first place.",

      "Hungary's two main political parties are using a national holiday on Thursday to rally supporters in Budapest",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Hungary's two main political parties will mark a national holiday on Thursday by holding rival demonstrations that will likely bring hundreds of thousands to the streets and kick off a campaign for elections next year.",
      "With the ballot approaching in April, long-serving Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n \u2014 trailing in most polls to his main political rival, P\u00e9ter Magyar \u2014 hopes to use Thursday's show of force to reinvigorate his base that has had its confidence shaken by a series of political scandals and years of high prices and economic stagnation.",
      "Magyar, a onetime insider within Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party who erupted onto Hungary\u2019s political scene last year, aims to channel a growing number of dissatisfied voters into what will be both a political rally and anti-government protest. Observers of Thursday's events will be watching the size and enthusiasm of the crowds as a barometer for which way the needle is tilting within the country\u2019s polarized political climate.",
      "Thursday's marches, which will culminate with speeches by Orb\u00e1n and Magyar, coincide with the 69th anniversary of Hungary's failed 1956 anti-Soviet uprising. The date has long been a sobering reminder of Moscow's domination of Hungary during the Cold War, but Orb\u00e1n's warm relations with the Kremlin and combative approach toward Ukraine have in recent years transformed the country's posture toward its former occupier.",
      "That alignment was underscored last week when U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would meet in Budapest with Russia's Vladimir Putin for talks on ending the war in Ukraine. Orb\u00e1n, a close Trump ally, celebrated the move as a personal political achievement, and said Hungary was \u201cthe only place in Europe\u201d such talks could be held.",
      "Yet Orb\u00e1n will go into Thursday's demonstrations with a sense of deflation after the White House announced Tuesday that the planned meeting will not go forward, at least not for now. His supporters will still hold what's been billed as a \u201cpeace march,\u201d and his speech is expected to focus on what he argues are the dangers posed by Ukraine and the need to negotiate with Moscow.",
      "Many Hungarians, however, viewed the prospect of Putin\u2019s visit as carrying dark historical echoes. Hosting the Russian leader so near the anniversary of the 1956 uprising \u2014 crushed by Soviet tanks \u2014 struck some as another example of Orb\u00e1n's drift into Russia's orbit. One group planned to protest the visit, calling it \u201cnot diplomacy, not neutrality, but a national disgrace.\u201d",
      "Since Magyar's arrival on Hungary's political stage, Orb\u00e1n's anti-EU government has engaged its massive media machine to smear and discredit him, portraying him as a puppet controlled by bureaucrats in Brussels. The Hungarian leader has also accused his political rival, without providing evidence, of working with Ukrainian secret services to topple his government.",
      "Fidesz officials have posted and shared dozens of AI-generated videos depicting Magyar in various fabricated scenarios, while a taxpayer-funded \u201cnational consultation\u201d questionnaire has been mailed to every Hungarian adult, insinuating that Tisza plans to impose disastrous tax hikes on Hungarian families.",

      "Orb\u00e1n's sinking popularity has coincided with growing accusations of corruption and the increasing visibility of opulent lifestyles enjoyed by government-connected figures. Magyar has regularly accused Orb\u00e1n and his allies of misusing public funds for their own enrichment, allegations Orb\u00e1n denies.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- HANOI, Vietnam (AP) \u2014 Millions of tons of discarded electronics from the United States are being shipped overseas, much of it to developing countries in Southeast Asia unprepared to safely handle hazardous waste, according to a new report by an environmental watchdog.",
      "The Seattle-based Basel Action Network, or BAN, said a two-year investigation found at least 10 U.S. companies exporting used electronics to Asia and the Middle East, in what it says is a \u201chidden tsunami\u201d of electronic waste.",
      "\u201cThis new, almost invisible tsunami of e-waste, is taking place ... padding already lucrative profit margins of the electronics recycling sector while allowing a major portion of the American public\u2019s and corporate IT equipment to be surreptitiously exported to and processed under harmful conditions in Southeast Asia,\u201d the report said.",
      "Electronic waste, or e-waste, includes discarded devices like phones and computers containing both valuable materials and toxic metals like lead, cadmium and mercury. As gadgets are replaced faster, global e-waste is growing five times quicker than it\u2019s formally recycled.",

      "That American e-waste adds to the burden for Asia, which already produces nearly half the world\u2019s total. Much of it is dumped in landfills, leaching toxic chemicals into the environment. Some ends up in informal scrapyards, where workers burn or dismantle devices by hand, often without protection, releasing toxic fumes and scrap.",
      "About 2,000 containers \u2014 roughly 33,000 metric tons (36,376 U.S. tons) \u2014 of used electronics leave U.S. ports every month, according to the report. It said the companies behind the shipments, described as \u201ce-waste brokers,\u201d typically don\u2019t recycle the waste themselves but send it to companies in developing countries.",
      "The companies identified in the report include Attan Recycling, Corporate eWaste Solutions or CEWS, Creative Metals Group, EDM, First American Metals, GEM Iron and Metal Inc., Greenland Resource, IQA Metals, PPM Recycling and Semsotai.",
      "Six of the companies did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "Semsotai told The Associated Press that it does not export scrap, only working components for reuse. It accused BAN of bias.",
      "PPM Recycling told The Associated Press it complies with all regulations and accurately handles shipments through certified partners. Greenland Resource told The Associated Press it took the allegations seriously and was reviewing the matter internally. Both said they couldn\u2019t comment further without seeing the report.",
      "CEWS said it follows strict environmental standards, but some aspects of where and how recycled materials are handled are industrial secrets.",
      "The report estimated that between January 2023 and February 2025, the 10 companies exported more than 10,000 containers of potential e-waste valued at over $1 billion, the report said. Industrywide, such trade could top $200 million a month.",
      "Eight of the 10 identified companies hold R2V3 certifications \u2014 an industry standard meant to ensure electronics are recycled safely and responsibly, raising questions about the value of such a certification, the report said.",
      "Several companies operate out of California, despite the state\u2019s strict e-waste laws requiring full reporting and proper downstream handling of electronic and universal waste.",
      "Many e-waste containers go to countries that have banned such imports under the Basel Convention, which is an international treaty that bars hazardous waste trade from non-signatories like the U.S., the only industrialized nation yet to ratify it.",

Such classifications were \u201chighly unlikely\u201d given how the companies publicly describe their operations, the report said.",

Walker, who studies global waste trade at the Dalhousie University\u2019s School for Resource and Environmental Studies in Halifax in Canada, said he wasn\u2019t surprised that e-waste continues to evade regulation.

Although some models barely change, others are completely redesigned and often get the latest features and improvements. Whether you\u2019re interested in improved fuel economy, cutting-edge technology, or maybe just fresh and distinctive styling, there\u2019s likely a car on the horizon that you\u2019ll be interested in. To ensure you don\u2019t miss out on the latest and greatest, the car experts at Edmunds highlight five vehicles you should consider waiting for.",
      "America\u2019s bestselling SUV is getting completely redesigned for the 2026 model year. Notably, the new RAV4 is going all-hybrid for 2026. Trust us, this is a good thing. The base RAV4 should get about 40 mpg for combined city/highway driving and produce a respectable 226 horsepower. Alternatively, you can get the RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid. It makes a sporty 320 horsepower and can drive an estimated 50 miles on all-electric power with a fully charged battery. Toyota has also modernized the RAV4\u2019s interior with a fresh design featuring large display screens and the brand\u2019s latest tech. The RAV4 will be available in several trim levels, including the outdoorsy RAV4 Woodland and the new sporty GR version.",

      "The Outback gets a full redesign for 2026. Subaru has moved on from the Outback\u2019s wagon profile in favor of a taller, boxier design that\u2019s meant to be more SUV-like. If the new styling isn\u2019t for you, the new interior likely will be. It\u2019s a big departure from the outgoing design. It\u2019s highlighted by a new infotainment system that has sharper-looking graphics and quicker responses to your touch. Unchanged, thankfully, is the Outback\u2019s impressive 8.7 inches of ground clearance that\u2019s helpful for wintertime travel and recreational off-roading. The rugged Wilderness model also returns to provide even more off-road capability. Expect the new Outback at dealerships this fall.",

Kia won\u2019t release official information on the next Telluride until late November, but we can get an idea of what to expect from the related Hyundai Palisade that has already been unveiled. We expect the new Telluride will have new technology features and, most notably, an available hybrid powertrain that could help this family hauler get more than 30 mpg.",

The new Prelude makes 200 horsepower, which is likely underwhelming for acceleration junkies. On the upside, however, the Prelude should get more than 40 mpg combined. It should also be fun to drive on twisty roads. Honda has given it a sophisticated suspension that should help the Prelude have sporty handling as well as a comfortable ride quality. The new Prelude has two small rear seats and a hatchback-style trunk, so it should be reasonably useful for everyday driving. Interestingly, Honda says there will be only one trim level of the Prelude and it will come fully loaded with features.",

      "The Ram Rev, formerly called the Ramcharger, is what Ram calls a range-extended electric truck, which is similar to a plug-in hybrid. The Rev has a large battery pack and two electric motors that provide an electric driving range of 145 miles and produce 647 horsepower. When the battery runs low, a V6 engine fires up and charges the battery, extending the total driving range to 690 miles. When the tank gets low, you can pump gas or charge the battery to hit the road again. The Rev touts an impressive towing capacity of 14,000 pounds and looks much like a regular Ram 1500 inside and out. We expect the hybrid Ram to hit the market sometime in 2026.",

      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says:",
      "\u201cWe call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\u201d",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\u201d",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\u201d",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\u201cThis is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It\u2019s simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\u201d",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

Most people don\u2019t want that.\u201d",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\u201cIn the past, it\u2019s mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\u201d said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI feel what we\u2019re really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\u201d",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to pause the development of more powerful AI models temporarily. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association along with the Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stockgrowers of America and other farming groups \u2014 who are normally some of the president's biggest supporters \u2014 all criticized Trump's idea because of what it could do to American ranchers and feedlot operators. And agricultural economists say Argentine beef accounts for such a small slice of beef imports \u2014 only about 2% \u2014 that even doubling that wouldn't change prices much.",
      "South Dakota rancher Brett Kenzy said he wants American consumers to determine whether beef is too expensive, not the government. And so far there is little sign that consumers are substituting chicken or other proteins for beef on their shopping lists even though the average price of a pound of ground beef hit its highest point ever at $6.32 in the latest report before the government shutdown began.",
      "\u201cI love \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 rhetoric. I love \u2018America First\u2019 rhetoric,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to me this feels a lot like the failed policies of the past \u2014 the free trade sourcing cheap global goods.\u201d",
      "Several factors have sent beef prices soaring, starting with continued strong demand combined with the smallest U.S. herd size since 1961. In part, that small herd is due to years of drought and low cattle prices.",
      "Beef imports also are down overall because of the 50% tariffs that Trump imposed on Brazil, a big beef exporter, and limits on Mexico, where the country is fighting a flesh-eating pest.",
      "Kansas State University agricultural economist Glynn Tonsor said Argentina can't produce enough beef to offset those other losses of imports.",
      "Through July, the United States has imported 72.5 million pounds of Argentine beef while producing more than 15 billion pounds of beef. Much of what is imported is lean beef trimmings that meatpackers mix with fattier beef produced in the United States to produce the varieties of ground beef that domestic consumers want, so any change in imports would affect primarily hamburger. Steak prices that were averaging $12.22 per pound probably wouldn't change much.",
      "Even if increased imports from Argentina won't reduce prices, the idea creates uncertainty for ranchers, making them less likely to invest in raising more cattle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re always going to have uncertainty in the world. But the more uncertain something is, the less likely most are to put money on the line,\u201d Tonsor said.",
      "Argentine livestock producers like Augusto Wallace are excited about the prospect of selling more beef to America because he said \u201cwhenever an additional buyer comes, it's beneficial for everyone, right? For all the producers.\u201d",
      "But economists caution that exporting too much beef could backfire for Argentina because that would drive up prices for consumers there.",
      "American ranchers say the idea of boosting imports from Argentina runs counter to the stated purpose of Trump's tariffs to encourage more domestic production and help American ranchers compete.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a contradiction of what we believed his new course of action was. We thought he was on the right track,\" said the president of R-CALF, Bill Bullard, who hoped Trump's policies would discourage imports and encourage ranchers to expand their herds.",

      "Although Kagay voted for Trump in the last election, he worries the trade war is hurting farmers and ranchers by driving up costs and costing them major markets like China.",
      "\u201cI continue to see things that I don\u2019t really think are in the best interest of our country and the average citizen,\u201d Kagay said. \u201cI guess I hope he starts to see that and quits worrying about punishing opponents and winning whatever battle he\u2019s involved in, and then tries to do what\u2019s best for everybody.\u201d",
      "Ranchers are hopeful Trump will reconsider this plan. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Tuesday on CNBC that the administration remains committed to helping ranchers prosper while trying to reduce consumer prices. She promised more details soon about the Argentina plan and a larger effort to reinvigorate U.S. beef production by opening up more land and opening new processing plants while securing trade deals for new markets. The administration wants ranchers to raise more cattle and produce more beef.",
      "\u201cThe bigger supply \u2014 even aligned with a bigger demand \u2014 is going to allow those prices to come down, but also to have a vital industry for these ranchers to be able to survive, which is what we've got to do,\u201d Rollins said.",

      "Millions of Ukrainians are preparing for another winter of blackouts as Russia renews its strikes on the country\u2019s energy grid",
      "SHOSTKA, Ukraine -- SHOSTKA, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 As the lights went out in her hometown, 40-year-old Zinaida Kot could not help but think about her next dialysis treatment for kidney disease. Without electricity, the machine that keeps her alive stops working.",
      "Kot is among millions of Ukrainians who are bracing for another winter of power cuts and possibly blackouts as Russia renewed its campaign of attacks on the country\u2019s energy grid. Analysts and officials say that this year Moscow has shifted tactics, targeting specific regions and gas infrastructure.",
      "In some regions \u2014 mostly those closer to the front line in the east \u2014 the season of buzzing generators has started, as well as long hours of darkness with no power or water. People are once again pulling out small power stations, charging numerous power banks, and storing bottles of water in their bathrooms.",
      "The attacks have grown more effective as Russia launches hundreds of drones, some equipped with cameras that improve targeting, overwhelming air defenses \u2014 especially in regions where protection is weaker.",
      "The consequences are already reshaping daily life \u2014 especially for those whose survival depends on electricity. For Zinaida Kot, who has been on dialysis for seven years, this is far worse than mere discomfort.",
      "\u201cIt is bad. We really worry when there is no electricity,\u201d she said from her hospital bed, connected to a dialysis machine powered by a generator that staff call \u201cnot reliable enough.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s no treatment, I would die. I would not exist.\u201d",
      "In early October, a Russian strike left the small northern town of Shostka \u2014 with a prewar population of nearly 72,000 \u2014 without electricity, water, or gas. The town lies just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the front line in northern Sumy region. Gas service was later restored, and electricity returned for only a few hours each day.",
      "\u201cThe situation is challenging,\u201d said Mykola Noha, the mayor of Shostka. Electricity and water are now supplied on a schedule, available for a few hours each day. \u201cAnd it really worries the residents as we can\u2019t predict power cuts. We fix something and it gets destroyed again. This is our situation.\u201d",
      "Shostka hums with the low growl of generators on rain-dark asphalt, blanketed in yellow leaves. They power cafes, shops, residential buildings, and hospitals. Across town, so-called \u201cinvincibility points\u201d offer residents a place to charge devices, warm up, and even rest on cots provided.",
      "The hardest days, locals say, were when there was no gas \u2014 no heat or way to cook \u2014 and people made meals over open fires in the streets.",
      "At the local hospital, where all stoves are electric, staff built a simple wood-burning oven during the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion, in 2022, when the town came close to occupation. And now it helps to feed at least 180 patients, said Svitlana Zakotei, 57, a nurse who oversees the patients\u2019 meals.",
      "The hospital has spent three weeks running on generators \u2014 a costly lifeline that burns half a ton of fuel a day, about 250,000 hryvnias ($5,973) a week, said the hospital's chief, Oleh Shtohryn. That\u2019s nearly as much as its usual monthly electricity bill.",
      "Power is rationed. In the dialysis ward, lights stay dim so electricity can feed the machines that keep patients alive. One of the eight units burned out because of the blackout \u2014 a costly loss the hospital could not afford to replace soon. Still, 23 patients come daily for hourslong treatment.",
      "The crisis in Shostka reflects Russia\u2019s shifting strategy. In 2022\u20132023, Moscow launched waves of missiles and drones across the country to destabilize Ukraine\u2019s national grid. This year, it is striking region by region.",
      "The recent pattern shows heavier attacks on the Chernihiv, Sumy, and Poltava regions, while Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, and Dnipro face less frequent but still regular strikes.",
      "On Tuesday, Chernihiv and part of the region were left without electricity after Russia attacked the local energy grid the night before, local officials said.",

      "Share prices have soared in Japan recently on hopes that conservative lawmaker Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen Tuesday to be Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, will double down on market friendly policies",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Share prices have soared recently in Tokyo on hopes that conservative Japanese lawmaker Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen Tuesday to be Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, will double down on market friendly policies, including hefty spending on defense and cheap credit.",
      "The benchmark Nikkei 225 share index climbed close to the symbolically important 50,000 level, gaining 0.7% to 49,517.57. Takaichi, a motorbike and heavy metal enthusiast, prevailed in a lower house parliamentary ballot that gave her 237 votes, above the 233 votes required to win.",
      "Here\u2019s what might be expected from what has been dubbed \u201cSanaenomics:\u201d",
      "Increases in consumer prices have surpassed the Bank of Japan\u2019s 2% target range at 2.5% to 3%. So the central bank is gradually raising rates from their longstanding level near or below zero. Wages remain near the level they were at 30 years ago, only topping the 1997 average level in 2024 for the first time. Meanwhile, low rates have helped to keep the Japanese yen weak against the dollar, amplifying inflation since much of what Japan consumes is imported.",
      "\u201cI want to focus first on dealing with rising consumer prices,\u201d Takaichi told reporters after she was elected head of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party earlier this month, putting her in line to replace departing Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Takaichi has indicated she opposes raising interest rates. The promise of continued cheap credit is one reason share prices have shot higher. But keeping rates low will hinder efforts to curb inflation and to strengthen the Japanese yen.",
      "Echoing many of her predecessors\u2019 promises, Takaichi also has vowed to deliver wage increases, without saying how she intends to do that.",
      "Japan\u2019s population has been shrinking and rapidly aging for years, leading to labor shortages and undermining the country\u2019s potential economic growth.",
      "Although she is an unabashed conservative on most social issues, Takaichi has said she favors giving tax incentives to companies that provide child care facilities to their employees and possible tax breaks for family spending on child care.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what more the government might do under any leader to counter the low birth rate, which partly reflects the financial difficulties of raising and educating children when wages fail to keep up with inflation. It also reflects a corporate culture that is not conducive to a family-friendly work-life balance.",
      "Takaichi is expected to emulate the policies of her late mentor, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He stepped down in 2020 and was assassinated in 2022. His \u201cAbenomics\u201d approach included promises of cash handouts and boosting government spending, despite a national debt that is nearly triple the size of the economy.",

      "Takaichi is bound to seek cordial relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, just as Abe did, and to strengthen Japan\u2019s security alliance with Washington. They are expected to meet later this month.",
      "Initially Takaichi said Japan might want to rethink its pledge of $550 billion to the Trump administration, part of a deal that helped lower U.S. tariffs on imports from Japan. She later said she would honor the agreement, despite public disapproval over handing over Japanese taxpayers\u2019 money to Washington.",
      "Takaichi will be confronting problems that have confounded Japan\u2019s leadership for decades. Any major reforms would face resistance from entrenched vested interests. The tenures of Japanese prime ministers tend to be short and vulnerable to feuding between party factions and the hereditary political fiefdoms that control most seats in parliament.",
      "To win Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary vote, the Liberal Democrats forged an alliance with the Japan Innovation Party, a libertarian opposition group based in Osaka.",
      "But Takaichi likely will need support from lawmakers belonging to other parties in the fractious and splintered opposition to pass legislation. They span the spectrum from the Japan Communist Party on the far left to the Sanseito and others on the extreme right.",
      "Takaya Suzuki, who runs a restaurant and real estate business, supports one of the smaller nationalist-leaning opposition parties called The Conservative Party of Japan, whose policies are similar to Takaichi\u2019s. He admires Trump and says he\u2019s rooting for Takaichi.",

      "Trump\u2019s strategy of improvisation has had both hits and misses since he returned to office in January. Hamas returned hostages to Israel but the ceasefire in the Middle East remains fragile; a trade war with China has ebbed and flowed this year; and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine hasn\u2019t slowed down despite Trump\u2019s efforts to resolve the conflict.",
      "There's been some mystery around Trump's trip, with no official announcements from the White House about much of his itinerary. The president said Monday that he plans to go to Malaysia, which is hosting a regional summit, then Japan, where he's trying to nail down foreign investment.",
      "He'll also visit South Korea, where he's working on more trade issues and expects to sit down with Xi. Beijing has yet to confirm that they\u2019ll meet, and the two leaders have recently exchanged threats of tariffs and export restrictions.",
      "\"I have a very good relationship with President Xi of China,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday. He offered to lower tariffs but \u201cthey have to give us some things too,\u201d including buying U.S. soybeans, reducing the flow of fentanyl ingredients and ending limits on rare earth minerals that are critical for high-tech manufacturing.",
      "Trump expressed even more confidence on Monday, saying, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to end up having a fantastic deal with China\" and \"it\u2019s going to be fantastic for the entire world.\u201d",
      "With just days to go before Trump leaves, there\u2019s an unusual level of ambiguity even for a president who loves to keep people guessing about his next move.",
      "\u201cThe whole trip has seemed so uncertain from the beginning,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, a managing director at the German Marshall Fund, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "It's Trump's first trip to Asia since returning to office. Although he\u2019s hosted leaders from the region at the White House, he hasn\u2019t forged the kind of foundational relationships that he has on other continents.",
      "Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the president, responded to a list of questions about Trump\u2019s plans by saying he \u201cwill participate in meetings and events in Asia that will result in many great deals for our country.\u201d She added, \u201cStay tuned!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Asia has focused on using tariffs to realign what he describes as unfair trade practices, unnerving countries that depend on the United States as the world\u2019s largest market for exports. There\u2019s also anxiety about Trump\u2019s meeting with Xi, and the potential that a feud between the two leaders could send the international economy into a tailspin.",
      "\u201cThere will be some appreciation for the fact that he\u2019s there, but I don\u2019t think it will go far enough to quell the doubts that are pervasive in the region,\u201d Glaser predicted.",
      "The Republican president has downsized his foreign policy team since his first term, eschewing the typical array of advisers at the National Security Council in favor of a core group of loyalists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not very many White House staff to do this kind of work,\u201d said Rush Doshi, who worked on China policy under President Joe Biden. \u201cAll of this puts us in uncharted waters.\u201d",
      "Michael Green, who worked on President George W. Bush's National Security Council and now leads the United States Studies Centre in Sydney, Australia, said there's been no clear Asia strategy from Trump.",
      "\u201cEveryone is waiting to see where he\u2019s going to come down on all of this,\" he said.",
      "Others say Trump's approach is paying off. Anthony Kim, a research fellow in international economic affairs at the Heritage Foundation, said Japan and South Korea are eager to work with the administration to solidify partnerships.",
      "The message from them has been \u201clet\u2019s sit down, talk about relevant details to make a deal,\u201d Kim said.",

      "Trump's remarks come after Beijing infuriated him by expanding export controls on rare earth products that are used in smartphones, fighter jets, electric vehicles and more. Trump spoke as he hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House, celebrating an agreement with the U.S. ally as a potential counterpoint to China's near-monopoly in processing those critical minerals.",

      "All eyes are on a potential meeting between Trump and Xi because any failure to reach some agreement raises the risk of destabilizing not only relations between the two superpowers but also the global economy.",
      "Trump affirmed that he would meet with Xi this month on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, a grouping of 21 economies. Beijing has not announced plans for Xi to make the trip to South Korea, but it's not unusual for such details to emerge closer to the travel date.",
      "The president has threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on China in response to Beijing\u2019s expanded rules on rare earth products. And he said Monday that it has already had results.",
      "\u201cNow, they\u2019re treating us with great respect,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll see what happens. I said, if we don\u2019t make a deal, I\u2019m putting on an additional 100% on November 1. I think we\u2019ll make a deal.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump has levied additional 30% across-the-board tariffs on China. Trump said the total rate on Chinese goods is about 55% to 57% and the country has paid the U.S. \u201chundreds of billions of dollars worth of money for tariffs.\u201d",

      "\u201cThreatening high tariffs is not the right way to deal with China,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said last week in response to Trump's new tariffs threat.",

      "But a European fan group praised the decision, and the Spanish government called for more transparency in any future negotiations to try to play a league game abroad.",
      "The Dec. 20 game at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami was called off on Tuesday amid growing opposition from players, fans and some clubs. The league cited the \u201cuncertainty that has arisen in Spain over the past few weeks.\u201d",

This is a seismic victory for European football and everyone who believes the game belongs at the heart of our communities,\" the group said in a statement. \u201cLa Liga\u2019s defeat sends a clear message to the world of football: such ill-conceived projects are doomed to fail.

      "Ukraine's top Olympic sliding contender said he is disappointed and frustrated with the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation's possible willingness to let Russian athletes compete in the upcoming Milan-Cortina Games, saying it would lead to countless issues including safety concerns and doping questions.",
      "Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was fourth at last season's skeleton world championships, told The Associated Press that the decision by IBSF to throw out part of its own ruling banning Russian sliders from its competitions caught him by surprise. Russians have not been part of international sliding since that country invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "\u201cI don't understand this,\u201d Heraskevych said in an interview from Sigulda, Latvia, where he is training for the upcoming season. \u201cFor me, it's unacceptable.\u201d",
      "He also said he would not feel safe competing alongside Russian athletes, out of concerns that some of them may be part of the war effort.",
      "\"If I\u2019m on a track with Russian soldier, I\u2019m not feeling safe,\" Heraskevych said. \u201cWhat if it's the same soldiers now killing people in Ukraine?\u201d",
      "There is some confusion about what happens next, or what will happen when sliding season starts in earnest next month.",
      "The IBSF, at its congress last month in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy \u2014 the sliding site for the upcoming Olympics \u2014 voted down a notion that could have let Russian athletes compete as individuals with neutral status. Luge officials made a similar decision months earlier, and all three of the sliding sports have kept Russian athletes from competing in international events such as World Cup races and world championships since the invasion occurred.",
      "\u201cFor us, it was a closed question at the congress in Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo,\u201d Heraskevych said. \u201cIt was a vote, secret vote, results were pretty clear and for me it was kind of a closed chapter.\u201d",

      "\u201cI would say this (IBSF decision) is very biased,\u201d Heraskevych said. \u201cIt only takes into account the Russian side.\u201d",
      "Heraskevych spent about two months in Ukraine during the offseason. It was not easy. Sights and sounds of war were everywhere, he said. He spent some nights sleeping in corridors and basements for safety. Electricity is shut off in some places, water in others.",
      "\u201cIt's what life was like 10 centuries ago,\u201d Heraskevych said. \u201cIt is literally crazy.\u201d",
      "There were 28 sliders from Russia \u2014 10 in luge, six in skeleton and 12 in bobsled \u2014 at the 2022 Beijing Games, though they competed under the Russian Olympic Committee flag and not the actual Russian flag. That was part of the sanctions levied against Russia for the state-sponsored doping scandal that overshadowed the 2014 Sochi Olympics.",
      "The Beijing Games closed four days before the attack on Ukraine started. Russian athlete Tatyana Ivanova won a bronze medal in women\u2019s singles luge. Heraskevych competed in those Beijing Games, grabbing headlines by displaying a \u201cNo War in Ukraine\u201d sign after his third run.",
      "Heraskevych is enormously popular among other sliders, and Ukrainian athletes often hear \u201cSl\u00e1va Ukray\u00edni,\u201d which translates to \u201cGlory to Ukraine,\u201d when they compete at World Cup stops in Europe and North America. He is likely to be a contender for what would be Ukraine's first Olympic skeleton medal.",
      "\u201cI feel that I\u2019m among strongest athletes in the world in my sport and definitely our goal is fight for a medal,\u201d Heraskevych said. \u201cBut for me, medals are not everything. We have much more important things in life \u2014 and the life of my fellow citizens is a more important thing for me than some medal going around my neck.\u201d",

      "Data centers needed to fuel AI accounted for about 1.5% of the world\u2019s electricity consumption last year, and those facilities' energy consumption is predicted to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. That increase could lead to burning more fossil fuels such as coal and gas, which release greenhouse gases that contribute to warming temperatures, sea level rise and extreme weather.",
      "But when AI's computing power is used to analyze energy usage and pollution, it can also make buildings more efficient, charge devices at optimal times, make oil and gas production less polluting and schedule traffic lights to reduce vehicle emissions.",

      "AI can be used to make buildings more energy-efficient by automatically adjusting lighting, ventilation, heating and cooling based on weather data, electricity usage and other factors, said Bob French, chief evangelist at the building automation company 75F. Around one-third of U.S. greenhouse gas pollution comes from homes and buildings.",
      "Letting AI schedule air conditioning and heating around workers' arrivals and departures can be more efficient than manually adjusting the thermostat. Otherwise, a worker's instinct might be to blast the air to quickly adjust the temperature. Automated thermostats can be particularly useful for smaller buildings where it's not cost-effective to overhaul the entire heating and cooling system.",
      "For building ventilation, automation can balance the intake of outside air against how much heating or cooling is needed to maintain indoor temperatures.",
      "AI can also monitor the maintenance needs of HVAC systems and other equipment to predict and detect failures before they lead to costlier repairs.",
      "Combined, these automations can reduce a building's energy consumption by between 10% and 30%, experts said.",

      "AI can schedule the most efficient charging of electric vehicles and other devices such as smartphones.",
      "This means setting a schedule for when it is best to draw power from the grid, such as overnight, when demand and rates are lower so it\u2019s less likely to make the grid burn more fossil fuels.",

      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",

      "\u201cYeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \u201cBut does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don\u2019t want that.\u201d",

      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of stuff that\u2019s overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\u201d Tegmark said.",

None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",

      "\u201cI really empathize for them, frankly, because they\u2019re so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\u201d Tegmark said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\u201d",

      "Chess grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky has died at the age of 29",
      "Daniel Naroditsky, a 29-year-old standard-bearer in the world of competitive speed chess that flourished in the COVID-19 pandemic, died over the weekend and leaves behind a legacy as one of the greats of the game who helped usher in its digital era.",
      "The American grandmaster won several championships and amassed hundreds of thousands of subscribers on YouTube, Twitch and other platforms, where he would livestream matches and explain strategy in real time. But he also struggled with the cyberspace he helped build.",
      "High-speed games became wildly popular online during the pandemic, creating a chess community that was soon rife with cheating allegations as players gained access to sophisticated computer programs that could give them an unfair advantage.",
      "Naroditsky's untimely death has shined a spotlight on the dark underbelly of the game that fellow pros say brought undue hostility upon the chess star in his final months.",
      "Naroditsky had been accused of cheating, and the allegations, never proven, had taken a toll. Ukrainian grandmaster Oleksandr Bortnyk, a competitor and friend of Naroditsky, was concerned and went to check on him Sunday. He and a friend found Naroditsky, known to many as Danya, unresponsive on a couch in his North Carolina home, Bortnyk recounted during an emotional livestream Monday.",
      "The cause of death has not been made public.",
      "\u201cDanya was not only a brilliant grandmaster, but also a tireless ambassador for chess, and above all \u2014 a kind, compassionate and truly good person,\u201d said Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation.",
      "The unsubstantiated claims of cheating came from from Russian grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Vladimir Kramnik, whom Naroditsky had called one of the \u201cheroes\u201d he looked up to as a kid.",
      "Naroditsky had denied the claims as he excelled at blitz and bullet chess, where players have mere minutes to finish intense matches.",
      "\u201cEver since the Kramnik stuff, I feel like if I start doing well, people assume the worst of intentions,\u201d Naroditsky said Saturday in the last livestream he filmed before his death. \u201cThe issue is just the lingering effect of it.\u201d",
      "He ruminated about his legacy and hoped other top players would trust that he played with integrity.",
      "Chess pros from around the world have since praised Naroditsky as an honorable player who used his online platform to make chess more accessible. His family said in a statement that they hope he will be remembered for the joy and inspiration he brought people.",
      "Meanwhile, grandmasters have slammed Kramnik on social media for how he treated Naroditsky. American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura went on an expletive-laden rant on his latest livestream, and Indian grandmaster Nihal Sarin accused the Russian pro of trying to destroy Naroditsky's life in a post on X.",
      "Kramnik continued to post about Naroditsky on the day his death was announced, calling it a tragedy and speculating about the cause.",

He was consistently ranked in the top 200 worldwide for traditional chess and was a top 25 blitz player, winning the U.S. National Blitz Championship in August. He spent much of his time training young players.",
      "\u201cDaniel was an incredible teacher and explainer of chess and concepts and ideas,\u201d said Daniel Weissbarth, a renowned chess instructor and the co-owner of Silver Knights Chess Academy in Virginia.",
      "Many pros this week called for an end to the constant finger-pointing that seemed to follow players like Naroditsky who thrived in fast-paced play.",
      "Kenneth Regan, a chess international master and computer science professor at the University at Buffalo, said the opportunity to cheat has exploded as the cerebral sport has shifted online. There are ways to police the game online, but Regan said they are intrusive.",
      "\u201cThe rate of cheating online is 100 to 200 times higher than the rate over the board,\u201d Regan said. \u201cFrom my point of view, there are five to 10 cases per year over the board.\u201d",
      "The popular internet chess server Chess.com shut down Kramnik\u2019s blog on the site in 2023, saying he had used it to spread baseless cheating allegations about \u201cmany dozens of players.\u201d At the time, the platform warned of \u201cKramnik\u2019s escalating attacks\u201d against some of the most respected members of the chess community and some promising young talents.",
      "The speedy style of play popularized in chess' digital arena is somewhat reliant on the honor system.",
      "Top talents analyze the board so quickly and move with such precision that cheating allegations have become common. Bullet chess is so fast, Regan said, that it's essentially \u201cplaying chess entirely with your gut.\u201d",
      "Last week, Naroditsky posted a video in his popular Speedrun series on YouTube, telling viewers he was \u201cback, better than ever\u201d after a short \u201ccreative break.\u201d His videos, in which he gave tips and discussed strategy, were great tools for chess players of various abilities, said Benjamin Balas, a psychology professor at North Dakota State.",

      "Netflix missed the earnings target set by stock market analysts during the video streamer\u2019s latest quarter, a letdown that the company blamed on a tax dispute in Brazil.",
      "The results announced Tuesday broke Netflix's six-quarter streak of posting a profit that eclipsed analysts' projections.",
      "The Los Gatos, California, cited an unexpected $619 million expense tied to the Brazilian tax dispute for the earnings shortfall while hailing its lineup of distinctive TV series and films for keeping its audience engaged and delivering a mix of subscriber fees and increased ad sales that helped it deliver revenue that matched analyst forecasts.",
      "Investors, though, weren't placated by the explanation as Netflix's shares still fell by about 6% in extended trading after the numbers came out.",
      "Analysts varied in their interpretation of the third-quarter report.",
      "Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro worries Netflix is using the Brazilian tax hit as a way to mask signs of a slowdown in subscriber growth and advertising amid economy uncertainty. \u201cThe truth is that the company failed to deliver the kind of growth we\u2019ve grown used to over the past couple of years,\u201d he said.",
      "But Zacks analyst Jeremy Mullin said he sees little reason for concern, asserting Netflix's \u201cunderlying story remains solid.\u201d",
      "Netflix earned $2.5 billion, or $5.87 per share, in its July-September quarter, an 8% increase from the same time last year. Revenue climbed 17% from last year to $11.5 billion. Analysts surveyed by FactSet Research had predicted the Los Gatos, California, company to earn $6.96 per share on revenue of $11.5 billion.",
      "Delivering solid financial growth has become more important than ever for Netflix as management has steered investors from fixating on how many subscribers its service gains from one quarter to the next. As part of that process, Netflix stopped disclosing its subscribers at the end of last year.",
      "The shift has paid off so far, with Netflix\u2019s stock price rising about 40% so far this year, although the downturn in extended trading signaled some of those gains are about to evaporate.",
      "Although Netflix no longer reveals the specific, this year\u2019s revenue growth signals that its worldwide subscriber count has increased from the roughly 302 million it had at the end of last year \u2013 by far the most among video streamers, even as rivals with deeper pockets such as Amazon and Apple expand their programming selections.",

      "\u201cWe have a better understanding of the streaming business than any of our competitors,\u201d Greg Peters, Netflix's other co-CEO, boasted during the call.",
      "Netflix has maintained its lead by adding more live sports and video games to supplement its wide array of scripted programming \u2013 a diversification effort that will expand into video podcasts from Spotify next year.",
      "And now Netflix may have another opportunity to add even more compelling programming with Warner Bros. Discovery announcing it may sell all or part of its holdings, which include HBO, DC Studios and CNN. Analysts are already speculating that Netflix may join the bidders looking to grab a piece of Warner Bros. Discovery.",

Discovery's properties other than cable TV networks like CNN and TBS. \u201cWe can be and will be choosey,\u201d Sarandos said.",

      "Although the advertising business still isn\u2019t large enough to require the company to disclose its sales, management expects its revenue to more than double from last year. A recent analyst by S & P forecast $1.1 billion in ad sales for Netflix this year \u2014 a figure that would represent about 2% of its projected total revenue.",
      "It\u2019s getting to the point that Netflix may be in danger of trying to juggle too many ball at once, said Forrester Research analyst Mike Proulx. \u201cIf the company goes too broad to become all things entertainment, it risks diluting its core.\u201d",

      "Making its popular AI chatbot a gateway to online searches could allow OpenAI, the world's most valuable startup, to pull in more internet traffic and the revenue made from digital advertising. It could also further cut off the lifeblood of online publishers if ChatGPT so effectively feeds people summarized information that they stop exploring the internet and clicking on traditional web links.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT already has more than 800 million users but many of them get it for free. The San Francisco-based company also sells paid subscriptions but is losing more money than it makes and has been looking for ways to turn a profit.",

      "But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last month issued a decision that rejected the Chrome sale sought by the U.S. Justice Department in the monopoly case, partly because he believed advances in the AI industry already are reshaping the competitive landscape.",

      "Chrome\u2019s immense success could provide a blueprint for OpenAI as it enters the browser market. When Google released Chrome in 2008, Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer was so dominant that few observers believed a new browser could mount a formidable threat.",
      "But Chrome quickly won over legions of admirers by loading webpages more quickly than Internet Explorer while offering other advantages that enabled it to upend the market.

      "The U.S. unemployment rate for 22- to 27-year-old degree holders is the highest in a dozen years outside of the pandemic. Companies are reluctant to add staff amid so much economic uncertainty. The hiring slump is especially hitting professions such as information technology that employ more college graduates, creating nightmarish job hunts for the increasingly smaller number who do complete college. Not to mention fears that artificial intelligence will replace entry-level roles.",
      "So, Citi Foundation identified youth employability as the theme for its $25 million Global Innovation Challenge this year. The banking group's philanthropic arm is donating a half million dollars to each of 50 groups worldwide that provide digital literacy skills, technical training and career guidance for low-income youth.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to do is make sure young people are as prepared as possible to find employment in a world that\u2019s moving really quickly,\u201d said Ed Skyler, Citi Head of Enterprise Services and Public Affairs.",
      "Employer feedback suggested to Citi that early career applicants lacked the technical skills necessary for roles many had long prepared to fill, highlighting the need for continued vocational training and the importance of soft skills.",
      "Skyler pointed to the World Economic Forum\u2019s recent survey of more than 1,000 companies that together employ millions of people. Skills gaps were considered the biggest barrier to business transformation over the next five years. Two-thirds of respondents reported planning to hire people with specific AI skills and 40% of them anticipated eliminating jobs AI could complete.",

      "Hospitals and doctors' offices are inviting singers and musicians to help patients manage their pain, as music's ability to reduce pain is gaining attention",
      "Nurse Rod Salaysay works with all kinds of instruments in the hospital: a thermometer, a stethoscope and sometimes his guitar and ukulele.",
      "In the recovery unit of UC San Diego Health, Salaysay helps patients manage pain after surgery. Along with medications, he offers tunes on request and sometimes sings. His repertoire ranges from folk songs in English and Spanish to Minuet in G Major and movie favorites like \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d",
      "Patients often smile or nod along. Salaysay even sees changes in their vital signs like lower heart rate and blood pressure, and some may request fewer painkillers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s often a cycle of worry, pain, anxiety in a hospital,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you can help break that cycle with music.\u201d",
      "Salaysay is a one-man band, but he\u2019s not alone. Over the past two decades, live performances and recorded music have flowed into hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices as research grows on how songs can help ease pain.",
      "The healing power of song may sound intuitive given music\u2019s deep roots in human culture. But the science of whether and how music dulls acute and chronic pain \u2014 technically called music-induced analgesia \u2014 is just catching up.",
      "No one suggests that a catchy song can fully eliminate serious pain. But several recent studies, including in the journals Pain and Scientific Reports, have suggested that listening to music can either reduce the perception of pain or enhance a person\u2019s ability to tolerate it.",
      "What seems to matter most is that patients \u2014 or their families \u2014 choose the music selections themselves and listen intently, not just as background noise.",
      "\u201cPain is a really complex experience,\u201d said Adam Hanley, a psychologist at Florida State University. \u201cIt\u2019s created by a physical sensation, and by our thoughts about that sensation and emotional reaction to it.\u201d",
      "Two people with the same condition or injury may feel vastly different levels of acute or chronic pain. Or the same person might experience pain differently from one day to the next.",
      "Acute pain is felt when pain receptors in a specific part of the body \u2014 like a hand touching a hot stove \u2014 send signals to the brain, which processes the short-term pain. Chronic pain usually involves long-term structural or other changes to the brain, which heighten overall sensitivity to pain signals. Researchers are still investigating how this occurs.",
      "\u201cPain is interpreted and translated by the brain,\" which may ratchet the signal up or down, said Dr. Gilbert Chandler, a specialist in chronic spinal pain at the Tallahassee Orthopedic Clinic.",
      "Researchers know music can draw attention away from pain, lessening the sensation. But studies also suggest that listening to preferred music helps dull pain more than listening to podcasts.",
      "\u201cMusic is a distractor. It draws your focus away from the pain. But it\u2019s doing more than that,\" said Caroline Palmer, a psychologist at McGill University who studies music and pain.",
      "Scientists are still tracing the various neural pathways at work, said Palmer.",
      "\u201cWe know that almost all of the brain becomes active when we engage in music,\u201d said Kate Richards Geller, a registered music therapist in Los Angeles. \u201cThat changes the perception and experience of pain \u2014 and the isolation and anxiety of pain.\u201d",

      "Australian eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said Friday that information on her agency's website, esafety.gov.au, explained the new laws and how to navigate them.",
      "Starting Dec. 10, platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube could be fined up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they don\u2019t take reasonable steps to prevent Australians younger than 16 from holding accounts.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 On a scorching hot Saturday in San Antonio, dozens of teachers traded a day off for a glimpse of the future. The topic of the day\u2019s workshop: enhancing instruction with artificial intelligence.",
      "After marveling as AI graded classwork instantly and turned lesson plans into podcasts or online storybooks, one high school English teacher raised a concern that was on the minds of many: \u201cAre we going to be replaced with AI?\u201d",
      "That remains to be seen. But for the nation\u2019s 4 million teachers to stay relevant and help students use the technology wisely, teachers unions have forged an unlikely partnership with the world\u2019s largest technology companies. The two groups don\u2019t always see eye to eye but say they share a common goal: training the future workforce of America.",
      "Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic are providing millions of dollars for AI training to the American Federation of Teachers, the country\u2019s second-largest teachers union. In exchange, the tech companies have an opportunity to make inroads into schools and win over students in the race for AI dominance.",
      "AFT President Randi Weingarten said skepticism guided her negotiations, but the tech industry has something schools lack: deep pockets.",
      "\u201cThere is no one else who is helping us with this. That\u2019s why we felt we needed to work with the largest corporations in the world,\u201d Weingarten said. \u201cWe went to them \u2014 they didn\u2019t come to us.\u201d",
      "Weingarten first met with Microsoft CEO Brad Smith in 2023 to discuss a partnership. She later reached out to OpenAI to pursue an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach that means any company's AI tools could be used in a training session.",
      "Under the arrangement announced in July, Microsoft is contributing $12.5 million to AFT over five years. OpenAI is providing $8 million in funding and $2 million in technical resources, and Anthropic has offered $500,000.",
      "With the money, AFT is planning to build an AI training hub in New York City that will offer virtual and in-person workshops for teachers. The goal is to open at least two more hubs and train 400,000 teachers over the next five years.",
      "The National Education Association, the country\u2019s largest teachers union, announced its own partnership with Microsoft last month. The company has provided a $325,000 grant to help the NEA develop AI trainings in the form of \u201cmicrocredentials\u201d \u2014 online trainings open to the union\u2019s 3 million members, said Daaiyah Bilal, NEA\u2019s senior director of education policy. The goal is to train at least 10,000 members this school year.",
      "\u201cWe tailored our partnership very surgically,\u201d Bilal said. \u201cWe are very mindful of what a technology company stands to gain by spreading information about the products they develop.\u201d",

So far, more than 100 companies have signed up.",
      "Tech companies see opportunities in education beyond training teachers. Microsoft unveiled a $4 billion initiative for AI training, research and the gifting of its AI tools to teachers and students. It includes the AFT grant and a program that will give all school districts and community colleges in Washington, Microsoft\u2019s home state, free access to Microsoft CoPilot tools. Google says it will commit $1 billion for AI education and job training programs, including free access to its Gemini for Education platform for U.S. high schools.",
      "Several recent studies have found that AI use in schools is rapidly increasing but training and guidance are lagging.",

      "The findings, published Thursday in Microsoft's annual digital threats report, show how foreign adversaries are adopting new and innovative tactics in their efforts to weaponize the internet as a tool for espionage and deception.",
      "America's adversaries, as well as criminal gangs and hacking companies, have exploited AI's potential, using it to automate and improve cyberattacks, to spread inflammatory disinformation and to penetrate sensitive systems. AI can translate poorly worded phishing emails into fluent English, for example, as well as generate digital clones of senior government officials.",
      "Government cyber operations often aim to obtain classified information, undermine supply chains, disrupt critical public services or spread disinformation. Cyber criminals on the other hand work for profit by stealing corporate secrets or using ransomware to extort payments from their victims. These gangs are responsible for the wide majority of cyberattacks in the world and in some cases have built partnerships with countries like Russia.",
      "Increasingly, these attackers are using AI to target governments, businesses and critical systems like hospitals and transportation networks, according to Amy Hogan-Burney, Microsoft's vice president for customer security and trust, who oversaw the report. Many U.S. companies and organizations, meanwhile, are getting by with outdated cyber defenses, even as Americans expand their networks with new digital connections.",

      "The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant women who have been detained in Trump's immigration crackdown.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has defended the care given to pregnant detainees, saying they are given regular prenatal visits and nutritional support. The agency did not immediately provide figures on the number of pregnant women in detention, as Democrats have demanded.",
      "The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union gives accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while held in detention facilities in Louisiana and Georgia.",
      "The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody -- including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported \u201cgravely troubling experiences,\u201d the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a \u201csevere\u201d infection after her miscarriage.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, one of those woman said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana \u2014 a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.",
      "An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. \u201cHow am I going to escape if I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d the woman said she responded.",
      "She said she felt as if she'd been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and suffered from vaginal bleeding. During her time in the detention facility, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to \u201cbeg\u201d for water and toilet paper.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Republican legislative leaders were poised Wednesday to complete a retooling of part of the state's U.S. House map in hopes of picking up an additional GOP seat and helping President Donald Trump retain majority control of the lower chamber of Congress in next year's midterm elections.",
      "The state House scheduled floor debate and votes on proposed boundaries that if enacted would attempt to impede next year's reelection of Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis, who currently represents more than 20 northeastern counties. The state Senate already approved the plan along party lines on Tuesday.",
      "Republicans hold majorities in both General Assembly chambers, and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is unable under state law to use his veto stamp on redistricting maps. So the GOP\u2019s proposal would be implemented following affirmative House votes \u2014 barring successful litigation likely filed by Democrats or voting rights advocates to stop it. Candidate filing for 2026 is scheduled to begin Dec. 1.",
      "Republican lawmakers have said the proposed changes attempt to satisfy Trump\u2019s call in GOP-led states to secure more seats for the party nationwide and retain its grip on Congress and advance his agenda. Democrats are resisting those attempts with rival moves and need to gain just three more seats to seize control of the House. The president\u2019s party historically has lost seats in midterm elections.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this map was to pick up a Republican seat. We\u2019ve stated that over and over again,\u201d state Sen. Ralph Hise, who helped draw the altered map, said this week.",
      "The national redistricting battle began over the summer when Trump urged Republican-led Texas to reshape its U.S. House districts. After Texas lawmakers acted, California Democrats reciprocated by passing their own plan, which still needs voter approval in November.",
      "Under the replacement map, which would exchange several counties in Davis' current 1st District with another coastal district, the proposed map would favor Republicans winning 11 of the state's 14 congressional district seats \u2014 statewide election data suggests \u2014 up from the 10 they now hold.",
      "Davis is one of North Carolina\u2019s three Black representatives, and his 1st District includes several majority Black counties. Map critics have suggested upcoming lawsuits could accuse Republicans of creating an illegal racial gerrymander in a district that's elected African Americans to the U.S. House continuously since 1992.",
      "Davis won his second term in 2024 by less than 2 percentage points, and the 1st District was one of 13 congressional districts won both by a Democratic House member and by Trump, according to the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City's mayoral candidates are set to meet for their final debate Wednesday night, with Democrat Zohran Mamdani looking to stay in control of a race increasingly seen as his to win while former Gov. Andrew Cuomo amps up the pressure on Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out.",
      "With just days left until early voting begins, Cuomo has made a series of urgent pleas to the city\u2019s conservative voters to ditch Sliwa and instead to support him, casting the Republican candidate as a \u201cspoiler\u201d whose presence in the race will deliver Mamdani a win.",
      "The debate may be the former governor's last and best chance at making his case to run the country\u2019s biggest city ahead of next month's election.",
      "But Sliwa, the swaggering creator of the Guardian Angels crime patrol group, has forcefully maintained he will not exit the race and has in turn ramped up his criticism of the former governor.",
      "Mamdani, meanwhile, has spent his recent days campaigning on local issues and energizing his own supporters. Though he is expected to face an aggressive version of Cuomo on stage, as he did during last week's first debate, he will need to balance his counterattacks with the hopeful vision of the city that has driven his campaign's momentum.",
      "Here's what to watch for during the 90-minute debate Wednesday night, which will air live on Spectrum News NY1 and be streamed on the station\u2019s website beginning at 7 p.m.:",
      "Mamdani will attempt to stay above the fray and keep his focus on voters.",
      "\u201cWhile my opponents are focused on speaking about each other and which one of them should drop out, my focus will be on New Yorkers themselves and the concerns I\u2019ve heard from them,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday, according to the Daily News.",
      "But as the Democratic nominee, presumed frontrunner and rising national star, the state assemblyman is still expected to take heat on Wednesday night.",

      "Mamdani also got a little help from Sliwa. The Republican\u2019s sharpest attacks were reserved for Cuomo, forcing the 67-year-old into a defensive posture at a time when he needed to land significant blows against Mamdani to stifle the Democrat\u2019s momentum.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An immigration enforcement sweep targeting vendors on Manhattan\u2019s famed Canal Street turned chaotic on Tuesday after droves of angry New Yorkers surrounded federal agents and attempted to block them from driving off, prompting arrests and fierce standoffs along a bustling downtown corridor.",
      "The confrontation began shortly after 4 p.m., as federal agents fanned out across a section of Chinatown that has long served as a not-so-underground market for knock-off designer handbags, watches, perfumes, electronics and other goods.",
      "An Associated Press reporter observed dozens of agents detaining a street vendor selling bedazzled smartphone cases, one of a number of arrests in the area.",
      "In response, a contingent of protesters, many of whom appeared to be on their way home from work, surrounded the masked officers, attempting to block their vehicle as they shouted \u201cICE out of New York\" and called on other pedestrians to join them.",
      "Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and other federal offices then tried to clear the streets, in some cases shoving protesters to the ground and threatening them with pepper spray before detaining them.",
      "As more New Yorkers joined the fray, some of the federal agents retreated on foot, followed by jeering protesters and honking vehicles. Additional federal agents, armed with long guns and tactical gear, also arrived in a military tactical vehicle.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said the agents were conducting an enforcement operation against sellers of \u201ccounterfeit goods\u201d",
      "\u201cDuring this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,\u201d she said.",
      "At least one person was arrested for assaulting an officer, McLaughlin said. She did not respond to a request about how many vendors were detained.",
      "The sweep came days after a conservative influencer shared video on X showing a group of men selling bags on the street, urging the official ICE account to \u201ccheck this corner out.\u201d",
      "While clashes between immigration authorities and protesters have played out in Los Angeles and other cities, such scenes have been rarer on New York City streets, which Mayor Eric Adams has attributed in part to his working relationship with President Donald Trump's administration.",

      "But local and state leaders say that couldn't be farther from the truth, noting overall crime is down and the city has started to turn around its downtrodden pandemic image. Residents and workers out downtown this week said they\u2019re puzzled and concerned by Trump\u2019s threat.",
      "\u201cThis is a safe American city,\u201d Mayor Daniel Lurie told The Associated Press last week. \u201cWe got this in San Francisco.\u201d",
      "The Republican president has referenced crime as his justification for possibly sending troops to the city of roughly 830,000. He's deployed the Guard over crime concerns to Washington, D.C., where he has direct control of the National Guard, and Memphis, where the Republican governor supports their presence. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests. He's since said they're needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well.",
      "Residents and leaders in Portland were surprised by Trump\u2019s attention when he described the city as besieged by violent protests. In reality, nightly protests were small and limited to the area outside a federal immigration building. While there were some arrests for violence, the demonstrations were far less intense than those that roiled the downtown in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.",
      "In San Francisco, too, Trump seems to be relying on an outdated picture of a city often targeted by conservatives.",
      "\u201cThe difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco,\u201d Trump said Sunday on Fox News. \u201cSan Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world. And then, 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.\u201d",

      "San Francisco is still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, which emptied its downtown and brought renewed attention to street homelessness and open drug dealing. But signs indicate a city on the upswing. Artificial intelligence startups are snapping up office space, and home rental prices are rising. San Francisco saw a 21% increase from last year in office visits, according to location analytics platform Placer.ai, and public transit ridership is at its highest levels since the pandemic.",

Vehicle break-ins \u2014 which have vexed tourists and residents alike \u2014 are at a 22-year low, Lurie said.",
      "Lurie, a centrist Democrat who has tried to avoid confrontations with Trump by ignoring many of the president's comments, said Monday he'd welcome more federal help to arrest drug dealers and disrupt drug markets. But sending in the Guard wouldn't achieve that, he said.",

He has frowned on the past practice of presidents hosting state dinners and other large events in tents on the South Lawn.",
      "Trump says the project will be paid for with private donations and that no public money will be spent on the ballroom. The White House promised to release information on which individuals and corporations have pledged or donated money and invited some of the donors to an East Room dinner last week, but has not released a comprehensive list and breakdown of funds.",

      "Renderings released by the White House suggest a strong resemblance to the gilded ballroom at Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club and home in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "The project also has grown in size since it was announced, going from accommodating 650 seated guests to holding 999 people, big enough to fit an inauguration if needed, he said at a recent White House dinner for donors. Windows will be bulletproof, he said.",
      "The White House has said the ballroom will be ready for use before Trump's second term ends in January 2029, an ambitious timeline.",
      "Yes. He has heavily redecorated the Oval Office by adding numerous portraits, busts and gold-toned adornments. He converted the Rose Garden into a stone-covered patio, installed towering flagpoles on the north and south lawns, and decorated an exterior wall with portraits of every president except his immediate predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Trump also said he renovated the bathroom in the famous Lincoln Bedroom in the private living quarters and laid down marble floors in a passageway leading to the South Lawn.",
      "Presidents have added to the White House since construction began in 1792 for a host of reasons, and Trump aides say his decision to build a ballroom follows that long tradition.",
      "Many of the prior projects were criticized as being too costly or too lavish, but eventually came to be accepted, according to the White House Historical Association.",
      "Thomas Jefferson added the east and west colonnades.",
      "Andrew Jackson built the North Portico on the Pennsylvania Avenue side of the White House, aligning with the South Portico that James Monroe added after the original mansion was rebuilt after the British burned it during the War of 1812.",
      "Theodore Roosevelt added the West Wing to provide dedicated space for the president and key staff, while Franklin D. Roosevelt added the East Wing, which over time became the home base for the first lady's staff and social functions.",
      "One of the most significant White House renovations happened under Harry Truman, when the mansion was found to be so structurally unsound that he ordered a complete gutting of the interior that lasted from 1948 to 1952. The project, including Truman's addition of a balcony to the second floor of the South Portico, was highly controversial.",
      "Other changes include the creation of the Rose Garden during John F. Kennedy's administration and Richard Nixon's decision to convert an indoor swimming pool that was built for FDR's physical therapy into a workspace for the growing White House press corps.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration has agreed to resume student loan forgiveness for an estimated 2.5 million borrowers who are enrolled in certain federal repayment plans following a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers.",
      "Under the agreement reached Friday between the teachers union and the administration, the Education Department will process loan forgiveness for those eligible in certain repayment plans that offer lower monthly payments based on a borrower's earnings. The government had stopped providing forgiveness under those plans based on its interpretation of a different court decision.",
      "The agreement will also protect borrowers from being hit with high tax bills on debt due to be forgiven this year.",
      "\u201cWe took on the Trump administration when it refused to follow the law and denied borrowers the relief they were owed,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten said in a statement. \u201cOur agreement means that those borrowers stuck in limbo can either get immediate relief or finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d",
      "The Education Department said the Trump administration is reviewing forgiveness programs to identify ones that were not affected by court rulings that blocked much of the Biden administration's efforts to cancel student debt.",
      "\u201cThe Administration looks forward to continuing its work to simplify the student loan repayment process through implementation of the President\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d the department said in a statement.",
      "According to the deal, the Trump administration must cancel student debt for eligible borrowers enrolled in the following plans: income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, income-contingent repayment plans, Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) plans.",
      "If borrowers have made payments beyond what was needed for forgiveness, those payments will be reimbursed. The Education Department must also continue to process IDR and PSLF \u201cbuyback\u201d applications. Balances forgiven before Dec. 31 will not be treated as taxable income, as they will in 2026 due to a recent change in tax law.",
      "The administration must also file progress reports every six months with the court to show the pace of application processing and loan forgiveness, according to the AFT.",

      "If borrowers continue to make payments while their application is pending forgiveness, that will be refunded to them if they are successful, Walter said. \u201cBut keep really good records,\u201d she said.",
      "Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which has been in place since 2007, forgives federal student loans for borrowers who have worked at non-profit organizations or in public service after 120 payments, or 10 years. The Biden administration also created an option for borrowers to \u201cbuy back\u201d months of payments they missed during forbearance or deferment in 2023, to allow more people to qualify for that forgiveness.",

      "The lawsuit filed by the former Colorado driver demands that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission resume investigating her claims that Amazon discriminates against female drivers by failing to provide adequate bathroom breaks.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest example of workers and others scrambling to find recourse as federal agencies abandon their cases in response to Trump\u2019s shake-up of the country\u2019s civil rights enforcement infrastructure.",
      "The EEOC, which enforces civil rights laws in the workplace, decided last month to discharge any complaints based on \u201cdisparate impact liability,\u201d which holds that policies that are neutral on their face can be discriminatory if they impose unnecessary barriers that disadvantage different demographic groups.",
      "The EEOC's decision came in response to an executive order in April directing federal agencies to deprioritize the use of disparate impact liability. The Trump administration argues that disparate impact assumes any racial or gender imbalance in workplaces is the result of discrimination and leads to practices that undermine meritocracy.",

      "It's unclear how many worker complaints involving disparate impact liability or LGBTQ+ workers have been sidelined by the EEOC. In her lawsuit, Cross demanded that the EEOC, which handled more than 88,000 discrimination charges in 2024, give the court a list of the disparate impact liability charges it has shut down.",

      "Cross, who worked as a driver from August to November 2022, filed her EEOC charge two years ago, arguing that the company's delivery schedules make it nearly impossible for drivers to find time to use bathrooms.

Companies are reluctant to add staff amid so much economic uncertainty. The hiring slump is especially hitting professions such as information technology that employ more college graduates, creating nightmarish job hunts for the increasingly smaller number who do complete college. Not to mention fears that artificial intelligence will replace entry-level roles.",

The banking group's philanthropic arm is donating a half million dollars to each of 50 groups worldwide that provide digital literacy skills, technical training and career guidance for low-income youth.",

      "The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries or are underfed, scientists have said. That has emerged as a problem for the whale because they aren't producing enough babies to sustain their population, they've said.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Ace Frehley (April 27, 1951-Oct. 16, 2025) was a founding member and lead guitarist of the rock band Kiss, whose theatrical makeup, costumes and stagecraft made them a leading proponent of glam rock in the 1970s and '80s.",
      "Born Paul Daniel Frehley into a musical family, he played guitar since age 13, and performed with bands around New York City. At 18 he was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix.",
      "In 1973 Frehley joined with singer-guitarist Paul Stanley, bassist Gene Simmons and drummer Peter Criss to form Kiss. Their earliest albums did not sell well, but their stage antics \u2014 replete with pyrotechnics and stage blood, and guitars that emitted smoke during solos \u2014 earned them a following. By 1976 their albums \"Destroyer\" and \"Rock and Roll Over\" went platinum, and 1977's \"Love Gun\" hit #4 on the Billboard chart.",
      "Frehley frequently feuded with fellow band members Stanley and Simmons, and left Kiss in 1982.",
      "He performed both as a solo artist and with his band, Frehley's Comet, before rejoining Kiss in the mid-1990s, reclaiming his persona of \"The Spaceman,\" or \"Space Ace.\" He stayed until 2002, when he resumed recording solo and with Frehley's Comet.",
      "The original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.",
      "In 2024 Frehley told Guitar World magazine, \"I'm always flattered when people tell me I influenced them. If I knew I was going to influence thousands of guitar players, I would have practiced more!\u00a0 I laugh, but that's the truth. \u2026 I've had so many players come up to me and say, 'You are the reason I play guitar,' and I'm always like, 'Wow.'\""

      "Introduction",
      "\"Honey, you're the third Tim Curry to call today,\" she said, and hung up the phone.",
      "It was the spring of 1976. By an extraordinary coincidence, I had recently moved into a great apartment right behind the Waverly cinema, in New York's Greenwich Village. The Waverly was the flagship of several key venues that were experiencing success with a little film called The Rocky Horror Picture Show, whose new life had only just taken off.",
      "I'd been in the stage adaptation, and we'd had an extraordinary run in London and Los Angeles. But when the film was released in 1975, it had bombed rather spectacularly. Less than a year later, it was going through a sort of renaissance, due to some genius marketing and raucous audience participation.",
      "Naturally, I was curious, however hesitant, about this new incarnation. I'd called a day ahead of time, to let them know that I was a member of the cast and to ask if they would be so kind as to reserve a few tickets for my friends and me.",
      "\"And who are you?\" the woman asked. Her accent was rather aggressive and I caught the distinct whiff of exaggerated boredom in her tone.",
      "\"This is Tim Curry.\"",
      "That was when I was informed of the previous two Tims. The receiver dinged, and the line went dead.",
      "I stared at the phone, both bemused and irate by her response. Ultimately, my friends and I showed up anyway (with identification). We didn't wear special costumes or anything like that \u2014 I'm not inclined to do so unless it's required or earned. Luckily, as much renewed success as the show was now having, it wasn't terribly difficult to get tickets. We went in and sat toward the back of the theater. I was far more interested in viewing the spectacle than in participating, and the crowd's engagement was a true delight to behold.",
      "Before long, people started noticing me. A group of girls came up to my seat, giggling, touched my arm or leg, then tittered as they dispersed. It was all rather surreal, especially with the film, the fevered audience participation, and the all-too- familiar music carrying on in the background.",
      "Unintentionally, I'd created a stir among the already animated audience. About a half hour into the film, the woman from the ticket booth of the Waverly \u2014 a slightly bedraggled, very unlikely blonde \u2014 hustled down the aisle and pulled me out of my seat.",
      "\"You are an imposter,\" she hissed. \"You must leave. You're a nightmare! And you are not Tim Curry at all \u2014 you don't even look like him!\" She pointed at the screen, her long red fingernail trembling with emphasis.",
      "I stood up slowly and, with a mixture of embarrassment and triumph (neither of which were particularly founded), I handed her my passport.",
      "She snatched it, squinted at the photo, looked back at my face, then back at the passport. In the flickering light, I watched her haughty expression collapse. Speechless, she seemed to sort of melt in front of me, evoking a wicked witch who had been assaulted by a bucket of water.",
      "Aware I was now on a stage of sorts, I steadied myself and waited for her response.",
      "\"Ohhh my God. Oh, Mr. Curry. I didn't ... Please just ... please sit down.\"",
      "I took my passport back and gestured to my friends.",
      "\"I wouldn't dream of it!\" I said, and promptly strode out of the cinema.",
      "By definition \u2014 as one who has professionally pretended or masqueraded onstage, onscreen, and into a microphone \u2014 there is an argument to be made that I have been a career imposter for most of my life.",
      "But if you ask me, there's a much better word for my vocation and identity, a word that carries me back to my earliest days.",
      "Vagabond.",
      "Vagabonds rove. We travel about and pick up work wherever we go. We wander, drift, stagger, wink. Reluctant to be pinned down, we're enticed by risk, restless if we linger, fueled by curiosity and a sense of wonder.",
      "Vagabonds learn, often from a young age, that indeed time is fleeting. As is fame \u2014 a fairly worthless pursuit, really. We are less startled by life's unpredictable shifts than those who choose to remain safe and settled. We often practice our trade in varied locations.",
      "Those of us with itinerant upbringings or similar proclivities often have no choice but to adapt and reinvent ourselves. Over and over and over again. We rely on charming exteriors and don't mind saying so, leading us to project an inflated sense of self-confidence. We feel deeply but are perhaps less inclined to express our true selves to others \u2014 because our relationships so often prove to be ephemeral.",
      "Of course, these qualities don't apply to all vagabonds. I'm not sure they'll apply to me tomorrow. But it feels about right today.",
      "In Shakespearean times, people of the stage were considered rogues and vagabonds. I always rather liked that. I presume that such labels came about because of actors assuming manifold identities, traveling from one town to the next in pursuit of new audiences and a bit of coin here and there. How can you trust somebody, or truly know somebody, who appears as a king one day and a jester the next? What does it mean when neither role is the true identity of the person, and when that very person might be gone the next day? These entertainers with ever-changing faces and varied costumes were presumed to be scoundrels, not regarded as honorable or honest members of society.",
      "That part doesn't define me, of course.",
      "I'm very trustworthy.",
      "You believe me, don't you?",
      "Over the course of my life, my vagabond blues, hopes, and highs have found their way into varied channels of expression, different creative boxes from which flashes of my real self could emerge. Through my songs. Delivered upon the stage. Exhibited on screens. Cultivated in my homes and gardens. Re-envisioned, attached to, and filtered through more voices and personas than I can recall.",
      "Much of this book has involved returning to those characters, the ones who defined my professional life. As there is a piece of me who either exists in or understands each of the roles we'll be revisiting, surveying them together will hopefully yield a colorful, curious mosaic of who I am, beneath the cosmetics and costumes.",
      "Looking in the rearview mirror is neither my instinct nor my preferred way of being. I'd rather get on with it and keep moving forward. I have never been one to dwell on past performances any more than is required. I do not snatch memorabilia from my films to keep it displayed around my house like glistening ashes. I find little reward lingering in nostalgia. Living gig to gig for the better (and worse) part of half a century, I have grown accustomed to appreciating and accepting lessons offered, then looking forward to the next challenge.",
      "That's the vagabond's way.",
      "And yet, it hasn't escaped my notice that others have jumped at the opportunity to make their own assumptions. I have been described as everything from a confounding sex symbol, to a home designer, to a rock 'n' roll singer, to an imposter, to the prince of Halloween, to a paralyzed tragic case, to a dead legend.",
      "Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.",
      "So, while that remains the case, I believe it's my turn \u2014 and my privilege \u2014 to malign my own reputation.",
      "Why expose myself now? After all, I'm quite comfortable in the shade, and it would be easy enough to remain there. But with time, the thought of sharing my story stayed on my mind and felt just risky enough to intrigue me as a creative pursuit. I've also developed increasing respect for the characters I've played over the course of my life, characters about whom I've spent no small amount of time answering (and avoiding) questions.",
      "More than anything, the challenges presented to me by being alive, by the pandemic, and by sundry health issues have offered an appalling amount of time to reflect. Strewn amid those reflections has been a recurring fantastical notion: Maybe it's time to write my story. Before I could even finish musing about what that might mean, self-doubt had persistently reared up, chuckling malevolently: You've got a nerve.",
      "I'm prone to heed that voice, which has so often intervened, posing the deceptively simple question: Who do you think you are?",
      "However, as loud and obstructive as that voice has been throughout my life, generations of you (yes, you) have continued to flatter me with curiosity and kind attention. In doing so, you have given me permission to mute my self-deprecating instincts \u2014 or at least to hold them at bay.",
      "Today, I am physically unable to take you on a vigorous vagabond's adventure, due to a stroke I endured in 2012 that has limited my capacity as an active tour guide. But my mind and most of my memories have remained intact, and within them exist a multitude of journeys perhaps worth sharing. Before I can no longer be bothered to recount them, I humbly invite you into my stories of living across various environments: seaside living, country living, city living; on the road, on the stage, crossing borders and blurring them, ever in a vagabond state. I've loved inhabiting most of those settings, and \u2014 with some notable exceptions \u2014 enjoy remembering the times I've had.",
      "You should know what you're in for, however.",
      "I'd hate to leave you dissatisfied.",
      "Before we raise the curtains, before the elevator descends, know this:",
      "This will not be a master class. I have stories to impart, not explicit lessons to teach. You may glean profound takeaways from where I've been, how I got there, whom I've met, what I've done, or how I finagled my way into repeatedly being cast as an irresistible villain. Even so, my words are not meant to serve as instructions on how to act, sing, become a voiceover artist, or remain resilient in the face of unforeseen physical hardship. In part, because I do not believe that I have mastered any of those things. Furthermore, since I was a young boy, I've been dubious of anyone who claims to be an authority. Far be it for me to adopt an expert's stance now.",
      "I must also warn (or assure) you that while there are scraps of my nature in all of my characters, I am none of them. That sentence feels too ludicrously obvious to put in writing, but the distinctions between who I really am and who I've pretended to be as an actor have proven to be a source of great disappointment to some audiences. It has not caused me much personal distress, beyond the periodic necessity to deter stalkers.",
      "Nor will this be a juicy Hollywood tell-all. Not because my moral compass won't allow it, or because I haven't had ample run-ins with juicy celebrities \u2014 but simply because I find such books immensely dull and highly susceptible to gathering dust.",
      "I also won't be dishing out lurid details of my love affairs. I guarantee you, if it matters, that I have experienced true love, true heartbreak, and everything in between, including no small amount of wreckage. Which, naturally, helps inform who I am. I have loved and been loved and I hope you have, too. But I'm not interested in your romances. And specifics about my affairs of the heart or the bedroom are \u2014 respectfully \u2014 none of your f***ing business.",
      "With those caveats taken care of, I sincerely hope you enjoy the escapades, illusions, and contradictions I've collected recklessly over the course of my vagabond days.",
      "I trust you're now shivering with antici - I'll play along; I'll SAY IT - pation ...",
      "Let's get on with it.",

    "summary": "After the deaths of his mother and father, actor-director Ben Stiller sought to pay tribute as few sons could: a documentary about their lives on-stage and off. But even he didn't anticipate to what depths his film, \"Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost,\" would go.",
    "story": [
      "A-List actor and director Ben Stiller knows a good story when he sees one, so he knew profiling his late parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, would be compelling. But even he had no idea how deep it would take him. \"No, I didn't!\" he laughed. \"I mean, I didn't know where it was gonna go.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara had been the husband-and-wife comedy team of the 1960s and '70s, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" 36 times. But for Ben and sister Amy, Stiller & Meara were also Mom & Dad \u2013 and that could get confusing.",
      "Stiller's new Apple TV documentary, \"Stiller & Meara\" Nothing Is Lost,\" examines how his parents navigated both roles.",
      "Married 62 years, their family life was shaped by Jerry's relentless ambition, and Anne's resentment doing comedy when her dream was to be a serious actress \u2013 and the drinking that followed. As Ben noted in his film, \"She had to go up there and do that act, because she was so good at it. But it wasn't really her true thing, you know? It wasn't her true happiness.\"",
      "The film is an adult's attempt to answer the complicated question that shaped his childhood: Where did the act end, and the marriage begin?",
      "In one archival interview, Jerry Stiller calls his wife \"the funniest woman in the world off stage and on stage. Now the thing is, when she does these funny things, I am an exploiter and opportunist, and I'll take a pencil and I'll start to write it down.\"",
      "Anne Meara picks up: \"He says we can use that on a show, and I'm ready to kill him! Again, where does the act end and the marriage begin?\"",
      "Ben Stiller said, \"There's so much footage and material and things to show of the good and the bad and the tension and the happy times. I felt it was really important to try to have a balance in the film that would relay to the audience what the reality was of their relationship, which was, I think, grounded in love.\"",
      "From 2010: Stiller & Meara on love and marriage (\"Sunday Morning\")",
      "It wasn't just old clips from long-ago shows that Stiller had access to. He stumbled into some unexpected help while cleaning out the family apartment to sell: Jerry Stiller had secretly taped everything, producing boxes and boxes of recordings. \"I had no idea that there were these sort of arguments and discussions that he had recorded,\" said Ben. \"All of it, I'd never heard before. It brought me back to being a kid in the house when they were working together.\"",
      "For a filmmaker trying to figure it all out, Ben Stiller had struck gold.",
      "Among the recordings was a conversation in which his father talks to his mother about her drinking, and confronts her about it.",
      "I asked, \"Was it important to you in terms of understanding your dad, that you could hear him do that?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Ben. \"I was like, 'Oh, okay. He really did speak to her about it.' Because as kids that was never anything we talked about.\"",
      "\"You may be carrying around this sense of, why didn't dad ever confront mom? Guess what \u2013 he did.\"",
      "\"Right! He did,\" said Ben. \"And it changed.\"",
      "This deconstruction of his parents' marriage came while Stiller was wrestling with his own mid-life issues. Separated at the time from his wife, actress Christine Taylor (with whom he later reconciled), Stiller describes himself as having felt out of balance and unhappy, disconnected from his family, and a little bit lost.",
      "He talked about the irony of thinking he was doing so much better than his parents: \"When you're younger, you think, Okay, I'm gonna do everything better. I'm not gonna make THAT mistake. I found myself at a place in my life where things weren't really in sync.\"",
      "Stiller & Meara now had some company under the magnifying glass: their son. \"I didn't want to pretend to be some sort of objective judge of their relationship when I had so many issues in my own relationships and my stuff,\" he said,",
      "Was that a challenging journey to make himself? \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Then it changed everything because it was like, oh, okay. I'm gonna have to, you know, talk about my own feelings! It's stuff that I don't really ever, you know, talk about.\"",
      "Not exactly where he expected to end up, when he started the project. In honest, raw, and revealing conversations with his daughter Ella and son Quin, Ben talked in the film about his own issues being the child of someone famous: \"I remember there was this one time I literally was on the street talking to him about the fact that I felt like he didn't pay enough attention to us, and while we were talking someone on the street came over and said, 'Jerry, I love you work' and he started talking [to them]!\"",
      "Stiller exposes the excruciating challenge of breaking patterns, when his son adds: \"That's hilarious, because just a few weeks ago we were all out at a restaurant and I'd been stressed about college stuff. And then the people there wanted to get a picture of you, and I remember I was so frustrated, like, the world just has to stop to get this picture.\"",
      "Stiller said, \"I was genuinely surprised when he told me that. As a filmmaker I thought, This is an interesting moment in the movie.\"",
      "\"As a father?\" I asked.",
      "\"As a father I was like, Oh, s***,\" he laughed.",
      "Ben Stiller has done something requiring more courage than simply making an honest movie about loved ones; he's made an honest movie about himself.",
      "I said, \"One of the most uncomfortable places you can ever be is the mirror, right? Sometimes your kids are holding up the mirror.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you know, it's kind of like \u2026 it is a bummer, 'cause I'm never gonna get to go back, you know?\" Stiller said.",
      "And that's helped him round the edges from his own childhood \u2013 finding the grace to give his parents by understanding he might need to seek some of his own.",
      "Asked where he stands in his relationship to his parents, Stiller replied, \"I don't know!\"",
      "\"All this work, and you don't know?\"",
      "\"Well, I mean, they're still not here. That was the sad thing for me about finishing the movie. It was like, Oh, now I don't have an excuse to kind of just be connecting with them here.\"",
      "I asked, \"This was an intense reconnection when it sounds like you needed it the most?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" said Stiller. \"Like my mom probably would have said, like, 'Yeah, go make a movie about it if you wanna figure out how to process your feelings!'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Oct 2025 09:40:15 -0400",
    "summary": "The star of \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" \"Clue\" and \"It\" has played roles campy, comical, and menacingly sinister, yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry. He talks about his memoir \"Vagabond,\" the stroke he suffered in 2012, and learning how to speak again.",
    "story": [
      "A stroke 13 years ago left Tim Curry partially paralyzed, but it hasn't diminished his memorable laugh, or the mystique about him. In 50 years on the screen, he's played so many types \u2013 campy, comical, menacingly sinister \u2013 yet his most inscrutable role is still Tim Curry.",
      "And being an enigma is exactly how he wants it. \"I think it's important,\" he said. \"I encourage it.\"",
      "Though Curry is out with a new memoir, \"Vagabond\" (to be published Tuesday by Grand Central), he's keeping some secrets to himself. \"One of the keys is to not encourage an identity, I think, and I've tried to nurse that,\" he said. \"I have protected that, and continue to.\"",
      "Born a military brat in Hong Kong, Curry grew up moving from place to place. As a boy, he worshipped his dad, a chaplain in the British Royal Navy. The last time he saw his father, when he was 10, was when his dad had a stroke: \"And as they were about to take him into the ambulance, he said, 'Look after your mother.'\"",
      "After his father's death, there was no one to buffer the impact of his mother, who would be kind one minute, then cruel the next. \"I actually think now that she was probably bipolar, because she could turn on a dime,\" Curry said.",
      "Acting offered him an escape from his mother's moods \u2013 and access to so different many different lives. He said what excited him about acting was \"the freedom of being somebody else, and I think that I was (like everybody else) drawn to the idea of fame probably, although I came to kind of rather despise it.\"",
      "His first nibble of notoriety came from his first paid gig, in the 1969 London production of \"Hair.\" It was a big deal, but nothing in comparison to what came next: \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" first on stage, then the movie. He joked that he got the part of Dr. Frank-N-Furter because of his legs. It was a transformative performance, for Curry, and the audience.",
      "Curry says what made the role unique was his power: \"He gave a lot of teenagers permission to be different, and I'm very happy that he did have that power.\"",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" earned Curry stardom. It did not earn praise, or even respect, from his mother. She lived well into her son's success, but \"she didn't make much of it,\" Curry said. \"She was scared of it.\"",
      "Why? \"Well, she said to me later that, 'I thought your head was gonna grow too big.' She would have preferred me to operate under the radar!\"",
      "He laughed: \"I never did. I didn't give a s*** about the radar!\"",
      "I asked, \"When Frank is committing his particularly most heinous act in 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' [killing Eddie with an axe], was some of that directed at your mom maybe?\"",
      "\"It's not directed at her, it's just channeling,\" Curry replied.",
      "\"Rocky Horror\" set up Curry to play some memorable screen villains \u2013 under a mountain of prosthetics in \"Legend,\" opposite Tom Cruise; as Pennywise in the Stephen King thriller \"It\"; and as Carol Burnett's scheming and duplicitous brother in \"Annie.\" \"I loved her to bits,\" Curry said of Burnett.",
      "And don't forget the hotel concierge in \"Home Alone 2,\" and the manipulative butler in \"Clue.\"",
      "But then came 2012, and the moment that changed Tim Curry's life. \"It was so strange,\" he said. \"I was actually having a massage, and the guy who was giving me a massage said, 'I'm worried about you. I think we should call a doctor.' I felt fine. I had no symptoms that I was aware of. I wasn't in pain.\"",
      "But he was taken to the hospital, where he learned he'd had a stroke. \"I though immediately of my dad. So, I was scared,\" he said.",
      "He then underwent invasive brain surgery, and had rehabilitation to learn how to speak again. \"That was very weird,\" he said. \"I hated not being able to speak.\"",
      "He also has paralysis on his left side. \"My face kind of went sideways,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"From reading the book, and from talking to the people here who care about you, there hasn't been a lot \u2013 I'm sure there was some self-pity, but it doesn't sound like there was a lot?\"",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Curry said. \"I hope not, because I don't admire self-pity much. Another legacy from my mother, I guess. It's one that I'm thankful for: Why are you so important that we have to pity you?\"",
      "Now 79, he's reached an age he didn't think he'd see back in 2012. Today, he's not remotely afraid of dying \u2013 though exactly what he means remains, fittingly, a mystery.",
      "\"I don't fear death,\" he said. \"I try to avoid it, as I think we all do! But I suspect that in the end, I will welcome it.\"",
      "And what does that mean? \"Well, I think it may be very comforting to go bye-bye \u2013 and I want to earn it!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "Britain's Prince Andrew will not use his royal titles, including the Duke of York, any longer, he said in a statement released by Buckingham Palace on Friday. The announcement comes after the release of excerpts from a posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who had repeatedly claimed to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to Andrew.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew, the younger brother of King Charles III, said in the statement. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "He continued: \"With His Majesty's agreement, we feel I must now go a step further. I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, sued Andrew in 2021, alleging that he forced her to engage in sexual acts against her will when she was 17 years old. The two reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Andrew has denied the allegations.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Guiffre's family said they believe Prince Andrew's decision to give up his royal titles is \"vindication for our sister and survivors everywhere.\" They called on Charles to strip him of the title of prince.",
      "\"This moment serves as victory for Virginia, who consistently maintained, 'He knows what happened, I know what happened, and there's only one of us telling the truth, and I know that's me,'\" the statement said. \"This is not just a victory for her, but for every single survivor of the horrific crimes perpetrated by Epstein and his co-conspirators.\"",
      "Giuffre was one of the most vocal accusers of Epstein, a convicted sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was found guilty of helping Epstein groom, recruit and sexually abuse underage girls. Giuffre alleged Maxwell connected her with Epstein, which Maxwell denies.",
      "In an excerpt of her memoir published by The Guardian, Giuffre describes her alleged encounters with Andrew in detail.",
      "\"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright,\" she wrote. \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has long been a source of tabloid fodder because of his links to Epstein, other questionable characters and money woes.",
      "His attempt to refute Giuffre's allegations backfired during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",
      "Within days of the interview, Andrew stepped down from his royal duties.",
      "As well as no longer being known as the Duke of York, Andrew will also give up other titles: Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order and Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter.",
      "He will remain a prince, which he has been entitled to since birth."

    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobidashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rikishi from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rikishi competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimarite, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rikishi is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rikishi on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onosato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

      "Frehley died peacefully surrounded by family in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall at his home, his agent said.",
      "Family members said in a statement\u00a0that they are \"completely devastated and heartbroken.\"",
      "\"In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth,\" Frehley's family said. \"We cherish all of his finest memories, his laughter, and celebrate his strengths and kindness that he bestowed upon others. The magnitude of his passing is of epic proportions, and beyond comprehension. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!\"",
      "Frehley's former Kiss bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, said in a statement they were \"devastated\" by Frehley's passing.",
      "\"He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history,\" the two said. \"He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. Our thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.\"",
      "Frehley is the first death among the four founding members.",

Doctors advised Frehley not to travel following his fall, Ostrosky said.",
      "Born in 1951 in the Bronx, Frehley grew up surrounded by music and received his first electric guitar as a Christmas present in 1964. Before joining Kiss, he played in local bands around New York City and was a roadie for Jimi Hendrix at age 18.",
      "Frehley co-founded Kiss in 1973 alongside Stanley, Simmons and Peter Criss. He played on many of Kiss' classic albums, including \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun.\" Today, Kiss has more gold albums than any other American band and has sold more than 100 million records worldwide.",
      "Kiss, whose hits include \"Rock and Roll All Nite\" and \"Detroit Rock City,\" was known for its intense stage shows, which included fireworks, smoke and eruptions of fake blood performed by band members in black-and-white painted faces, platform boots and black wigs.",
      "Band members took on the personas of comic book-style characters \u2014 Frehley was known as \"Space Ace\" and the \"Spaceman.\" The New York-born entertainer often experimented with pyrotechnics, making his guitars glow, emit smoke and shoot rockets from the headstock.",
      "The band was extremely popular, especially in the mid-1970s, selling tens of millions of albums and licensing its iconic look to sell numerous products. \"Beth\" was its biggest commercial hit in the U.S., peaking at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100 in 1976.",
      "Frehley later released his first solo album, \"Ace Frehley,\" in 1978, and his song \"New York Groove\" quickly became a hit. Frehley frequently feuded with Stanley and Simmons through the years and left Kiss in 1982 to form the band Frehley's Comet and later continued recording under his own name.",
      "In 1996, Frehley rejoined Kiss for their 1996 reunion tour but left again in the early 2000s. The band continued with replacement members wearing the Frehley and Criss makeup and costumes. Kiss performed a\u00a0farewell tour in 2023.",
      "When the original four entered the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, a dispute scrapped plans for them to perform. Simmons and Stanley objected to Criss and Frehley being inducted instead of then-guitarist Tommy Thayer and then-drummer Eric Singer.",
      "Simmons told Rolling Stone magazine that year that Frehley and Criss \"no longer deserve to wear the paint.\" \"The makeup is earned,\" he added. \"Just being there at the beginning is not enough.\"",
      "Frehley and Kiss also had a huge influence on the glammy style of 1980s so-called hair metal bands, including M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Poison.",
      "\"Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time,\" Poison front man\u00a0Bret Michaels\u00a0wrote Thursday on Instagram.",
      "As the Kennedy Center's new chair, President Trump named Kiss as one of this year's honorees.",

      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",
      "Cooper described it as more than just a biopic, saying his hope is that audiences see it as a call for compassion and connection.",
      "\"I suppose if there's anything that I want this film for people to take away from the film, it's if you're struggling, if you're despairing and if you don't know how to get help, can't afford help, ask,\" Cooper said."

      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

    "story": [
      "The demand for protein has soared as 61% of consumers in the U.S. increased their protein intake last year, according to new research from Minnesota-based food corporation Cargill. And social media influencers and brands alike are taking note.",
      "\"We're seeing that influencers, fitness professionals \u2013 they're all encouraging more protein after lifting,\" said Yasi Ansari, a clinical dietician at UCLA.",
      "The protein boom",
      "Protein is now a $114 billion industry and growing, according to Mintel, a global market intelligence company. The number of high protein shakes and drinks on the market rose by 122% from 2020 to 2024, Innova Market Insights reported, noting that Gen Z is driving most of the online chatter around the beverages.",
      "Chains like Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Smoothie King and others recently introduced protein-packed options and add-ons to their menus. PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta also said protein would be a big focus for the company, telling investors in July that \"consumers are adopting protein solutions in the diet at a pace that was not the case in a few months back, a few years back.\"",
      "Protein, an essential nutrient, certainly has health benefits.",
      "\"It's the building block of your bones, muscles and other organs, and getting enough is crucial for keeping your body working properly,\" Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition, said.",
      "Ansari noted it also helps to build enzymes, support hormone health and provide a structural component to hair, skin and nails.",
      "But \"today's wellness culture tends to overestimate the amount of protein most people actually need,\" Byrne said.",
      "Ideally the source of your protein is whole foods, instead of powders and supplements, registered dietitian Helen Tieu said.",
      "Consumer Reports recently found some protein powders and shakes contain high levels of lead. A total of 23 protein powders and shakes were tested as part of their investigation, which determined that more than two-thirds of the products contained unsafe levels of lead.",
      "\"For people who are able to reach their protein targets from whole foods, protein powders and supplements are not necessary,\" Tieu said. \"Limit protein powder intake to an occasional use when necessary. Whole foods also provide more nutrients and keep us full for longer, compared to an isolated protein powder supplement.\"",
      "For some people \u2014 including those with certain medical conditions or competitive athletes \u2014 protein supplements can be more crucial, Byrne said.",
      "\"Although I'd caveat that this generally isn't the case for everyday exercisers, even those who hit the gym or the trail daily,\" she said.",
      "How much protein is really needed in a diet?",
      "For growing children and adolescents, protein provides the building blocks for muscle, bones, skin and hormones. Getting enough protein is also essential for older adults. It can help preserve strength, maintain bone density and reduce the risk of age-related injury.",
      "Government guidelines suggest most adults aim for about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. For example, someone who weighs 150 lbs would need about 54 grams of protein \u2014 this is what's in about 6 ounces of cooked chicken breast, Byrne said.",
      "\"We want to look for high quality sources,\" Ansari said. \"So those are generally speaking animal protein. Now another way to do this is by combining beans and grains and making it a full meal.\"",
      "Byrne said you can calculate your estimated protein needs by consuming 0.36 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.",
      "\"That calculation is an oversimplification, and many people need more protein than this. But the idea that you need to slam a protein shake before and after every workout just to meet your needs and reach your goals is totally wrong,\" she said.",
      "High-protein foods",
      "\"To boost protein intake from whole foods, make sure to include protein at every meal, and aim for a minimum of 20 grams per meal to boost muscle protein synthesis,\" Tieu suggests.",
      "Some protein-rich foods include:",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:13:17 -0400",
    "summary": "A lapse in funding due to the shutdown could have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who rely on the federal food stamps program for groceries.",
    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement."

      "Guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) clarifies that a $100,000 fee imposed in September to obtain H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers applies only to new applicants who are living abroad.",
      "In a notice\u00a0posted\u00a0on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said.",
      "The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 \"requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\"",
      "The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.",
      "Importantly for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to move from one type of visa to another, such as from an F-1 visa for non-U.S. students to H-1B status.",
      "The White House had previously said the fee would apply to all new H-1B visa applicants, with exemptions for some specialized workers who do not \"pose a threat to the security or welfare\" of the U.S.",
      "In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary \"to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.\" He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "The Trump administration has said the $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will compel U.S. companies to hire Americans, instead of relying on labor from overseas. Many economists, however, expect mixed results.",
      "In the short term, some U.S. technology workers could see their job prospects improve, as employers turn away from foreign labor because of the hefty fee attached. Other research, however, such as a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment, from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics, found that H-1B workers actually \"help firms increase their employment,\" and that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains, which includes domestic hires.",
      "Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration over the foreign worker visa fee, calling it unlawful. It was the second complaint to be filed challenging the fee, with a coalition of health care groups and labor unions also challenging the policy's legality in a\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0filed in October."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:08:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations."

    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prince-harry-steve-bannon-unlikely-allies-ai-superintelligence-ban/",
    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 10:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "There are many big names in a group of unlikely allies seeking a ban, for now, on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
    "story": [
      "Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have joined prominent computer scientists, economists, artists, evangelical Christian leaders and American conservative commentators Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck to call for a ban on AI \"superintelligence\" they say could threaten humanity.",
      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\""

      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Freedom of Information Act requests",
      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion."

      "Because the Louvre is a national museum, its collections are considered state property for which the state alone bears responsibility, according to D\u00e9chelette. The French Ministry of Culture did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "\"Everything that belongs to state museums in France is uninsured, unless it leaves the museum,\" D\u00e9chelette told CBS News.",
      "D\u00e9chelette added that if any of the stolen crown jewels had left the museum for another exhibit, the price of insurance would have been calculated based on an estimated value.",
      "\"There is necessarily a value in the government accounts, and an estimate would be assigned with commissions and experts,\" he explained.",
      "Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau, who is investigating the incident, said Tuesday that the stolen crown jewels are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, according to the Associated Press. That estimate doesn't account for their historical value to France",

    "story": [
      "Six in 10 U.S. workers say their jobs fall short of the standards for a \"quality\" position \u2014 one that offers basics such as fair pay, a steady schedule and career growth \u2014 according to research from advocacy group Jobs for the Future.",
      "Although government labor statistics track how many Americans are employed and how much they earn, the official data doesn't offer a full picture of the state of the job market, researchers behind Jobs for the Future's new study said.",
      "\"We recognize that not only has the way we measure the economy not kept up with way work and the economy is changing, but it has never been sufficient in terms of letting us understand what's going on under hood of economy and across the workforce, which is the engine of economic prosperity in the U.S.,\" said Molly Blankenship, a director in solutions design and delivery at Jobs for the Future, which lobbies for policies aimed at spurring innovation,",
      "The group surveyed workers across industries and different types of jobs, in partnership with Gallup, the Families & Workers Fund and the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.",
      "\"We suspected when we started this work that the majority of Americans were not in jobs that were helping them,\" Blankenship added. \"This data confirms what we suspected, which is that the majority of American workers are not in quality jobs.\"",
      "What makes for a good job?",
      "A quality job is defined by five main criteria, according to Jobs for the Future:",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employmentWorkplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassmentGrowth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their careerAgency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's jobWork structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "Financial well-being, such as fair pay and stable employment",
      "Workplace culture and safety, meaning the worker is free from discrimination or harassment",
      "Growth and development opportunities, allowing employees to develop skills and advance their career",
      "Agency and voice, or the ability to influence decisions that impact one's job",
      "Work structure and agency, including a predictable schedule and manageable workload",
      "By those measures, only 40% of the more than 18,000 workers surveyed by the group said they are employed in quality jobs, while the remaining 60% said their jobs fall short of those standards. For example, 62% of employees said they have unpredictable work schedules, while about one-third said they are struggling financially, according to the survey.",
      "Only 27% of those surveyed by Jobs for the Futures said their jobs pay enough for them to feel financially comfortable; nearly 3 in 10 described themselves as \"just getting by\" or \"finding it difficult to get by.\"",
      "Beyond fair pay, workers also want to feel safe and respected in their jobs, while opportunities for growth are also valued, the study noted. One in four employees say they have no opportunities for promotion or advancement at work, the survey found.",
      "Another issue affecting how employees perceive their jobs is how employers use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence.",
      "\"There is tremendous concern over technology, how it's being adopted and how it will impact people's jobs in the future,\" Susan Houseman, a senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research and a contributor to the the report, told CBS News. \"The research indicates that they lack input on these issues.\"",
      "The degree of autonomy employees have in their jobs also shapes their daily routine and can affect their overall work-life balance, Jobs for the Future found. More than six in 10 employees said they lack control over their schedules, while more than half of workers said they often or sometimes work more than scheduled."

      "Crown jewels that were stolen in a dramatic weekend heist\u00a0at the Louvre are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, not including their historical value to France, the Paris prosecutor said Tuesday.",
      "About 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the gems and heist suspects, said prosecutor Laure Beccuau, whose office is leading the investigation.",
      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" she said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the Louvre, the world's most-visited museum, and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels on Sunday morning.",
      "But France's culture minister said Tuesday that the security apparatus installed at the Louvre worked properly during the theft.",
      "\"The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,\" the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. \"The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.\"",
      "Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency into what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working. But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.",
      "The robbery was \"a wound for all of us,\" she said. \"Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was broken into.",
      "Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre.",

Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",

      "\"We will catch them,\" he said of the thieves. But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 09:08:28 -0400",
    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",

      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",
      "AWS customers include some of the world's biggest businesses and organizations.",
      "\"So much of the world now relies on these three or four big (cloud) compute companies who provide the underlying infrastructure that when there's an issue like this, it can be really impactful across a broad range, a broad spectrum\" of online services, said Patrick Burgess, a cybersecurity expert at U.K.-based BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.",
      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

    "story": [
      "Americans are still cracking open cold ones, but what's inside their cans is changing.",
      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",
      "Mainstream alcohol brands are also testing the waters. Beer makers Lagunitas Brewing and Pabst have come up with their own THC-infused beverages.",
      "Whitney and Eberlein said the cannabis drink sector is growing most rapidly among women in their 30s and early 40s who are looking for more accessible, and less caloric, alternatives to alcoholic beverages.",
      "\"They still want to have a beverage, but they don't want the high amount of calories. They don't want the alcohol, they don't want the sugar, and they don't want to have a hangover the next morning,\" Whitney said. \"They're replacing their evening glass of wine with THC beverages.\""

    "story": [
      "Americans continue to\u00a0fall behind\u00a0on auto loan payments in the face of record-high car prices and high interest rates.",
      "A recent\u00a0study by VantageScore found that auto loan delinquency rates have increased by more than 50% over the past 15 years. The upward trend continues even as delinquency rates in other loan categories \u2014 including credit card loans, personal loans and home equity loans \u2014 have declined, according to the report.",
      "\"Back in 2010, auto loans were the least risky of all products at that point in time,\" Rikard Bandebo, chief economist at VantageScore, said in a recent video. \"Now, as we look at 2025, it's actually \u2014 excluding student loans \u2014 the riskiest credit product.\"",
      "While a growing number of Americans have been\u00a0falling behind\u00a0on car payments for years, auto loan delinquency rates have picked up after a pandemic-induced dip.",
      "The most recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve shows that auto loan delinquency rates \u2014 defined as the portion of loan balances that are at least 30 days past due \u2014 were at 3.8% in June 2024, the highest level since June 2010.",
      "The rise in delinquency rates includes all household income groups, VantageScore's data shows. What's more, delinquency rates among prime borrowers have climbed faster than subprime borrowers on an absolute basis.",
      "\"The broad-based decline in consumer credit quality indicates that economic pressures are no longer concentrated among some VantageScore credit tiers and income levels,\" Susan Fahy, executive vice president and chief digital officer at VantageScore, said in a statement.",
      "VantageScore also found that the average loan amount has increased 57% over the last 15 years \u2014 a bigger jump than any other loan category, including mortgages.",
      "Why people are falling behind on payments",
      "One of the main factors hurting car owners is rapidly increasing monthly payments.\u00a0Data from the Federal Reserve shows that average monthly payments increased roughly $130 from January 2020 to January 2023, to $600. By contrast, in the three-year-period from January 2017 to January 2020, average monthly car loan payments had increased approximately $40, from $430 to $470.",
      "Payments have continued to escalate: One in five new car loans have monthly payments that exceed $1,000, according to auto researcher\u00a0Edmunds.",
      "Behind the ballooning payments are rising car prices and interest rates. The average cost of a new vehicle is now more than $50,000, according to September data from Cox Automotive \u2014 the highest it's ever been.",
      "\"Prices for both new and used vehicles surged during and after the pandemic and they haven't come down,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Those higher vehicle costs have encouraged more buyers to finance their purchases, often at increased interest rates, Kates added. The average auto loan rate in September was 7% for new cars and approximately 11% for used cars, September\u00a0data\u00a0from Edmunds shows.",
      "\"The combination of elevated prices and borrowing costs has led to longer loan terms, which increase the total interest paid and raise the risk of borrowers becoming underwater as their cars depreciate faster than they pay down the loan,\" Kates said.",
      "Broader economic conditions are also influencing delinquency rates, experts have noted. Fahy from VantageScore said that in addition to higher borrowing costs, the rise in auto loan delinquencies could also be attributed to inflation and an unsteady employment picture.",
      "While inflation has cooled since its 2022 peak, many Americans are still feeling stretched by sky-high prices. A Bankrate analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data found that while the gap is narrowing, average wages are still trailing behind inflation and won't catch up until mid-2026."

      "Air travel could face more disruptions as the government shutdown enters its 20th day, with air traffic controllers starting to exhibit \"frustration\" at their delayed compensation, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox News' Fox & Friends and\u00a0CNBC's Squawk Box Monday.",
      "Some 13,000 air traffic controllers, charged with patrolling the skies and directing plane traffic, are among those workers looking for alternative ways to earn cash while they go without paychecks during the lapse in funding, according to Duffy.",
      "They are due to be paid again Oct. 28, but they are at risk of missing that paycheck if the government shutdown persists, Duffy said. Because the Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, they are required to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid, although they are guaranteed back pay once lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"They got a partial paycheck a week ago Tuesday. Their next paycheck comes a week from Tuesday. In that paycheck there will be no dollars. They don't get paid,\" Duffy said. \"[W]e have heard they are taking Uber jobs. They are doing DoorDash, they are [finding] ways to keep their families afloat.\"",
      "Since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, some flights and airports have experienced delays due to shortages of air traffic controllers, including Burbank, California; Denver, Colorado; and Newark, New Jersey, federal flight data showed earlier this month.",
      "The volume of workers calling out sick could spike as the next pay day approaches, Duffy added, which could lead to a greater number of delays than usual.",

    "summary": "With open enrollment starting soon, employees could get sticker shock, with their costs expected to rise 6% to 7% for 2026, a new study says.",
    "story": [
      "Open enrollment \u2014 the annual window when employees can adjust their benefits \u2014 may deliver sticker shock this year. Workers are likely to pay between 6% to 7% more for their 2026 employer-sponsored health insurance, more than double the current rate of inflation, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from consultant Mercer.",
      "That means employees could pay about $2,400 next year for single coverage in an employer-provided preferred provider organization, or PPO, the most common type of medical plan, Mercer said. Families would likely face paycheck deductions of $8,900 a year for their coverage, according to the group, whose projections are based on a survey of more than 1,700 employers.",
      "More working-age Americans receive health insurance through their employers than any other source, with about 60% \u2014 or 164.7 million people \u2014 covered by their workplaces, according to KFF.",
      "Companies, which typically pick up the bulk of their employees' health insurance costs, are likely to spend more than $18,000 on average to insure each worker in 2026, Mercer told CBS News. Workers typically shoulder between 16% to 25% of the total, depending on whether they are receiving single or family coverage, according to KFF's\u00a02024 employer health benefits survey.",
      "The findings come as American households continue to feel squeezed by rising prices, with inflation inching higher this year on everything from groceries to housing. The jump in health insurance costs are partly due to an aging workforce that's tapping more medical services, as well as increased demand for costly treatments such as the GLP-1 drugs used for weight loss, Mercer Chief Actuary Sunit Patel said.",
      "Employees \"might also see an increase in the cost-sharing provisions in the design as well \u2014 higher co-pays, higher deductibles \u2014 so it's getting hit on both ends,\" Beth Umland, director of research for health and benefits at Mercer, told CBS News.",
      "Employees who receive their health insurance through their employers will soon learn their new costs when open enrollment begins, which typically runs for several weeks in the fall but varies by company.",
      "Health care prices aren't likely to ease soon, Patel added, pointing to higher provider wages, inflation in medical goods, and an older workforce, as ongoing pressures. \"We think costs are pretty sticky right now,\" he said.",
      "Financial squeeze",
      "Americans pay double what residents in other developed nations pay for health care, even though outcomes in the U.S. are worse than those in other countries, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation noted in an August\u00a0analysis.",
      "In addition to an aging workforce and inflation, the complexity of the U.S. health care system is also driving those costs higher, noted Peterson. On top of that, growing consolidation amongst health insurers has made the market less competitive, resulting in higher costs, the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a\u00a0December report.",
      "Higher health care costs could add to the financial squeeze felt by many families, who are already coping with higher grocery, utility and housing prices, noted Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal-leaning economic think tank.",
      "A KFF poll in July found that 4 in 10 insured adults under 65 years old worry about affording their monthly health insurance.",
      "\"You can't really go without health care, so something else will have to give,\" Owens said. That could mean cutting \"a family vacation, a family trip to a soccer game, or putting groceries on the credit card so you can clear the health care premiums.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index, a basket of goods and services typically purchased by Americans, likely rose 3.1% on an annual basis in September, an uptick from August's 2.9% annual rate, according to economists polled by FactSet. The September inflation data will be released on Oct. 24."

These invasive infections typically develop within two months of eating contaminated food, according to the CDC.",
      "Multiple listeria outbreaks have been reported just this month. One impacted meal kits from the food subscription service HelloFresh\u00a0and another forced the recall of nearly 245,000 pounds of precooked pasta, from the California company Nate's Fine Foods, which turned deadly and potentially contaminated dozens of different products sold in grocery stores nationwide"

      "Certain brands of one of the country's most popular spices, cinnamon, could be hazardous to your health.",
      "In the last week, the Food and Drug Administration has identified four additional makers of ground cinnamon it says contain elevated levels of lead. In all, the agency has listed 16 labels as having concerning amounts of lead. The new additions include brands HAETAE, Roshni, Durra and Wise Wife.",
      "\"Based on the FDA's assessment, prolonged exposure to these products may be unsafe and could contribute to elevated levels of lead in the blood,\" the government agency says in its alert.",

      "So far, 10 of the 16 ground cinnamon brands identified by the FDA have issued recall announcements.",

      "Cinnamon's tainted history",
      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:11:43 -0400",
    "summary": "Senate hopeful Graham Platner told The Associated Press he was unaware his tattoo resembled a Nazi symbol.",
    "story": [
      "Maine Democratic Senate hopeful Graham Platner said Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been covered to no longer reflect an image widely recognized as a Nazi symbol.",
      "The first-time political candidate said he got the skull and crossbones tattoo in 2007, when he was in his 20s and in the Marine Corps. It happened during a night of drinking while he was on leave in Croatia, he said, adding he was unaware until recently that the image has been associated with Nazi police.",
      "Platner, in an Associated Press interview, said that while his campaign initially said he would remove the tattoo, he chose to cover it up with another tattoo due to the limited options where he lives in rural Maine.",
      "\"Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while,\" he said. \"I wanted this thing off my body.\"",
      "The initial tattoo image resembled a specific symbol of Hitler's paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II. Platner didn't offer details about the new tattoo, but offered to send the AP a photo later Wednesday.",
      "The tattoo revelation closely follows the discovery of a series of controversial online statements on Reddit, including one in which he dismissed sexual assault in the military. Platner attempted to explain his past online comments in a video he posted to X last week. In it, he addressed not only his previous comments dismissing military sexual assaults, but also his questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans.",
      "\"As I read through them, I read things that I absolutely do not agree with,\" Platner said in a five-minute apology video. \"I read through and I see things that \u2014 words and statements that I abhor. I also see the trajectory of my life.\"",
      "Platner also told Pod Save America that his past Reddit comments were intended to \"get a rise out of people on the Internet\" and \"weren't even reflective of my opinions back then.\"",
      "He has resisted calls to drop out of the race and has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills.",
      "Platner said he was not ashamed to confront his past comments and actions because it reflects the lessons he needed to take to get where he is today.",
      "\"I don't look at this as a liability,\" he told the AP. \"I look at this as is a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today. And I'm very proud of who I am.\"",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin was asked over the weekend, before the tattoo revelation, if Platner's past comments are disqualifying.",
      "\"I don't think they're disqualifying, but certainly they're not right,\" Martin said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" And I'm glad that he apologized for them. They're indefensible, they're hurtful, and they're offensive. The question, though, is I believe in second chances. I believe a lot of people say things at their most vulnerable times. They say things when they're young that again are offensive. And the question for me is whether or not they actually learn from them, whether or not they actually reflect on those, that they're sincere in their apology, and more importantly that they have changed their behavior.\"",
      "Platner has a planned town hall Wednesday in Ogunquit, Maine."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, began delivering a marathon speech on the Senate floor Tuesday evening, speaking overnight and into the morning Wednesday in protest of President Trump's policies.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and railed against the Trump administration through the night for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "New Jersey Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker, along with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, took turns asking Merkley extended questions late Tuesday and Wednesday morning, giving him brief breaks.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who they refuse to pay\u00a0\u2014\u00a0work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech\u00a0by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch."

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in discussing the ballroom construction, told Fox News Wednesday, \"Nearly every single president who has lived in this beautiful White House behind me has made modernizations and renovations of their own.\"",

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",

      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

      "Washington \u2014 Demolition on the White House's East Wing has begun, although President Trump previously said his ballroom addition to the White House wouldn't \"interfere\" with the building's existing structure.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the demolition and published an image of the work. And on Monday, a pool reporter captured video of part of the East Wing being torn down.",
      "During an event Monday with the Louisiana State University baseball team at the White House, the president remarked on the construction, which he said \"just started today.\"",
      "\"You know we're building \u2014 right behind us \u2014 we're building a ballroom,\" Mr. Trump said during the celebration of the 2025 NCAA champions in the White House East Room. He pointed out, \"Right on the other side, you have a lot of construction going on, which you might hear periodically.\"",
      "The president also referenced the construction during a meeting with GOP senators on the Rose Garden patio Tuesday. Mr. Trump overhauled the Rose Garden and covered the grass earlier this year to make it easier to host guests.",
      "\"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction in the back,\" he said. \"You hear that sound? Oh, that's music to my ears, I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it ... I think when I hear that sound, it reminds me of money. In this case, it reminds me of lack of money, because I'm paying for it.\"",
      "The president told reporters in September that construction had begun, though at the time, no part of the White House building had been demolished.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a social media post by Mr. Trump Monday announcing that \"ground has been broken\" for the \"new, big, beautiful White House Ballroom.\"",
      "\"For more than 150 years, every President has dreamt about having a Ballroom at the White House to accommodate people for grand parties, State visits, etc.,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"I am honored to be the first President to finally get this much-needed project underway \u2014 with zero cost to the American Taxpayer!\"",
      "The East Wing of the White House is fairly small and is where the first lady's office and staff are located.",
      "\"It won't interfere with the current building,\" the president said in July. \"It won't be. It'll be near it but not touching it \u2014 and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of.\"",
      "The White House says the project, which will cost $250 million, has been fully funded by private contributions from business and big tech, including Apple, Microsoft and Coinbase. Earlier this month, ballroom donors dined at the White House with Mr. Trump.",
      "By September, a number of companies had pledged to donate $5 million or more for the addition, multiple sources familiar with the matter said.",
      "The addition was originally planned to be 90,000 square feet, but that figure is likely to increase. The ballroom, which will be used for events that on occasion will include heads of state, is intended to hold 999 people, up from an initial estimate of 650. Mr. Trump said it will have bulletproof glass windows on all sides.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a D.C.-based nonprofit chartered by Congress that works to protect historical sites, wrote a letter Tuesday urging a \"pause\" to \"demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes.\"",
      "The letter was addressed to the National Capital Planning Commission, the National Park Service and the Commission of Fine Arts.",
      "\"While the National Trust acknowledges the utility of a larger meeting space at the White House, we are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself\u2014it is 55,000 square feet\u2014and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,\" the National Trust wrote.",

      "He was sent to prison at Federal Correctional Institution Fairton in New Jersey. He critiqued prison officials for how his arrival was handled.",
      "\"The first night was tough. No one truly prepares for something like this,\" Santos said. \"Imagine a dorm at a camp you really don't want to be at and it's been run down so bad but your parents really force you because they want to get rid of you for the summer - it's kind of the same.\"",
      "He went on to describe the tension he felt surrounding his arrival.",
      "\"From the get go, they did everything wrong, in my opinion, on how they dealt with bringing in a person into prison. Usually, people come in and nobody even knows there's a new guy. But for me, they shut down the camp, they shut down the facility, they took people and put them all indoors, made them stand up for a count so I can walk in. Kicked people out of their beds and shifted people around so I can have this, I guess, privileged spot bed, as if there was a difference between any of the other beds. I guess they were just trying to be overzealous and protective in their nature, and they created an environment that could've become hostile if I didn't have the personality to navigate it. But it was tough,\" Santos said.",
      "Santos said he spent 41 days in isolation due to death threats, in a cell that he says was fewer than six feet wide and nine feet high. He was kept in that cell 23 hours a day, with one hour of outdoor recreation time during weekdays. He said he stood outdoors in the rain just to stay out of that cell for that hour.",

America is a place for second chances. Everybody in this country is programmed to allow and give grace. That's our culture, as Americans, and I saw that in how people would send me the kindest letters.\"",

      "Nassau County DA Anne Donnelly released a statement Tuesday indicating it's a possibility.",
      "\"Since first learning of George Santos' actions, I have been at the forefront of bringing him to justice. I am proud of the work my office has done, and the conviction achieved in partnership with the U.S. Attorney's office. While the office cannot comment on ongoing investigations, suffice it to say that I remain focused on prosecuting political corruption wherever it exists regardless of political affiliation,\" Donnelly said.",
      "His reaction?",
      "\"I wasn't even aware of the statement Marcia,\" Santos said. \"I would fall short of words.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it raises concerns, for me,\" he added.",
      "Santos says he takes responsibility for his crimes, but...",
      "\"I believe I have made some very poor choices. I believe I have made some awful mistakes. I've hurt people. I don't believe I should've been treated the way I was in prison. I don't believe prison should be the way it is in our country,\" Santos said. \"I certainly, like many Americans in a bipartisan fashion, agree that my sentence and my entire process was over-politicized by a weaponized DOJ.\"",
      "Santos said\u00a0former Attorney General Merrick Garland was \"unhinged\" and \"trying to settle scores.\"",
      "Santos said he thinks he got a stiffer sentence because of the notoriety of his case.",
      "\"I believe the DOJ was specifically targeting me because I flipped a seat after almost 30 years of Democrat control, and they had a window because I gave them that window, because I was so self-destructive to myself, Marcia. So, that being said, it's obviously my fault, it's my own doing, but they were overzealous because of political expedience and convenience,\" Santos said.",
      "Santos says while he accepts responsibility for his crimes, people have a narrative about them that's inaccurate.",
      "\"I'm going to be forever targeted and having to live with people believing that I went out there and stole people's credit cards physically and used them on shopping sprees when that did not happen,\" Santos said. \"That never happened. It's not a fact.\"",
      "Santos said he had \"bad and very irresponsible accounting\" on his campaign.",
      "\"There were things that money was spent on that was not allowed. I take all responsibility, Marcia, the buck stops with me. But there were multiple steps to how that all happened. And I am here standing, and I take responsibility, because I want to move forward. There's no point in rehashing the past. That's already been adjudicated, right? I was granted a second lease on life and I want to use that to do good. I know what I shouldn't do. I have this insane experience that I just went through for 84 days, and I'm grateful for the clemency offered to me by President Trump, and I want to take that and use this opportunity to just do good,\" Santos said.",
      "Santos says he wants to work on prison reform",
      "Santos said he wants work on prison reform and helping troubled youth.",
      "\"We're not rehabilitating prisoners, hence our recidivism rate is through the roof,\" Santos said. \"We need to change the way we do prison in our country.\"",
      "Santos said he's planning to talk to Bureau of Prisons officials about his experiences. Santos said however he would rather work with an existing prison reform organization than start one of his own.",
      "\"I don't want the responsibility of managing finances. That is something I do not want,\" Santos said. \"I don't want that scrutiny. I don't want that responsibility. I want to do the work without having to take on all the brunt, right? Lobbying is not something I want to do, but I would love to do advocacy, which is two very different things.\"",
      "\"The best platform is to partner with a productive and effective organization, which I have a list of some that I'm already interested in. I'm speaking to two of them this week,\" Santos added.",
      "He said he wants to reduce the prison population not by letting people out but by \"truly rehabilitating them and reducing this obsession of sending people to prison for long periods of time when you can put them on house arrest, community service, fine them if they're wealthy people.\"",
      "Santos said there's a difference between white collar and violent criminals, and made clear he is not advocating for house arrest for violent prisoners.",
      "\"But I am advocating that that person is treated with dignity, and that they are given an opportunity for programs to better themselves, to have true rehabilitation with mental health programs and actually staffing an adequate amount of real medical professionals in prisons, not faux medical professionals, like I experienced,\" Santos said.",
      "On his ability to earn a living",
      "Santos said he still works as a columnist and he has \"other endeavors of business that I am engaged in that yield me income.\"",
      "A big lesson he learned?",
      "\"Wealth is not material. Wealth is your family,\" Santos said. \"That is the biggest lesson. I can forgo every jewelry, watch, you name it, name brand clothes and luxury that I have so long as I can have my family and they're healthy.\"",
      "Santos said he has no plans to seek office \"in the near future.\"",

      "\"Well, in a strange way, I felt empowered that I was able to do something myself, but I shouldn't have to,\" Carr said.",
      "Mayor Karen Bass' Office responded by email, saying the city is \"embracing new and innovative technologies like solar lighting,\" moving away from copper wire. \"Mayor Bass has begun that work as hundreds of solar streetlights have been installed,\" the Mayor's Office wrote.",
      "Assembly member Mark Gonz\u00e1lez authored AB 476, stating that \"Copper wire theft is not a victim-less crime.\"",
      "The bill puts more responsibility on junk dealers when purchasing scrap metal, leaving thieves with fewer options when selling. Buyers will be required to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. \u00a0Certain scrap metal from streetlights and traffic signals will be illegal to possess, and the bill also increases penalties for recyclers who purchase materials that belong to public entities without ensuring the seller has proper authorization to do so.",
      "\"Every stolen wire is more than metal ripped from the ground; it's light ripped from our communities,\" Gonz\u00e1lez said.",
      "On Tuesday, the city council approved a Metal and Wire Theft Reward Program that, if given final approval by Bass, would offer rewards of $5,000 for information leading to felony grand theft charges, and $1,000 for misdemeanor charges involving city-owned metal thefts, including copper wiring, plaques, streetlight parts and more."

Ingrassia has previously served as the White House's liaison to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated the 30-year-old attorney to lead the Office of Special Counsel in May, calling him a \"highly respected attorney, writer, and Constitutional Scholar.\" The office \u2014 which handles whistleblower complaints and investigates misconduct involving the federal workforce \u2014 has lacked a Senate-confirmed leader since Mr. Trump fired former head Hampton Dellinger.",
      "Ingrassia has faced bipartisan blowback since Politico reported Monday on incendiary texts that he allegedly sent in a group chat, including ones where he purportedly called Martin Luther King Jr. \"the 1960s George Floyd\" and said he has \"a Nazi streak in me from time to time.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters he didn't think Ingrassia will be confirmed, according to the Associated Press, after multiple Republican senators indicated that they would not support him.",
      "\"He's not going to pass,\" Thune said.",
      "Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told CBS News' chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Tuesday that Ingrassia's alleged texts are \"disqualifying to me,\" noting that Politico reported the messages were sent within the last year.",

      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Ingrassia has drawn controversy in the past, including for social media posts seemingly praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and calling for Jan. 6 to be made a national holiday.

      "North Carolina Republicans in 2024 fell short of ousting moderate Rep. Don Davis in a race that became a rare bright spot for Democrats.",
      "But defeating Davis may soon become easier for the GOP.",
      "State senators on Tuesday passed a new Congressional map that shifts the state's major battleground Democratic-held House district and makes it more favorable to conservatives. And while the state has a Democratic governor, his veto power is limited and he would not be able to reject a standalone map if it clears the North Carolina House as expected.",
      "North Carolina's quick turn to draw new congressional lines is deeply intertwined with attempts by Republican leaders around the country to help President Trump. Democrats are locked out of power in Washington and the House is widely seen as the party's most likely route to gaining back power in next year's midterms.",
      "At one point, Democrats winning back as few as three seats in the 2026 elections may have flipped control of the House. That dynamic has changed considerably in recent months as Mr. Trump and his allies have looked for Republican-led states to take Democratic districts and shift their boundaries in a way that boosts the GOP's chances at keeping control of the House next year.",
      "Republicans in Texas overhauled their state's map earlier this summer in an attempt to flip five Democratic-held seats. In response, California Democrats have put a measure on next month's ballot that could flip five of the state's GOP House seats toward Democrats. Not long after, Missouri Republicans were able to follow through on a longstanding push to alter a\u00a0 Kansas City-area district held for decades by Democrats and turn into one that favors Republicans.",
      "North Carolina is now primed to join that list, and more states could follow before the end of the year. No Democrat has won North Carolina in a presidential election since 2008, but statewide races in the southern battleground tend to be competitive. The state has a Democratic governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general but its two U.S. senators are Republicans. The state's congressional districts are already tilted to favor the GOP, with 10 of the state's 14 Congressional seats currently held by Republicans.",
      "Under the proposed map, Davis' Democratic battleground 1st Congressional District seat will be moved to try and make it more winnable for Republicans. This is done by adding parts of GOP Rep. Greg Murphy's current 3rd Congressional District, to the 1st.",
      "Davis said in a statement Tuesday that \"this new congressional map is beyond the pale,\" and noted that \"in the 2024 election with record voter turnout, NC's First Congressional District elected both President Trump and me.\"",
      "But Phil Berger, the GOP leader in the state Senate, contended in a statement of his own that \"this new map respects the will of the North Carolina voters who sent President Trump to the White House three times.\""

      "Attorneys for former special counsel Jack Smith called his actions \"entirely lawful, proper and consistent with established Department of Justice policy\" in defending the investigative steps taken by his team, including obtaining phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers as part of the probe of President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, published a document alleging that the phone data from eight GOP senators and one Republican House member were obtained by the FBI as part of Smith's investigation into efforts by President Trump and his allies to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In a letter to Grassley dated Monday, Smith's attorneys Lanny A. Breuer and Peter Koski wrote that they are \"compelled to correct inaccurate assertions made by you and others concerning the issuance of a grand jury subpoena\" for the lawmakers' phone records, rebuffing criticism from GOP lawmakers that the FBI \"tapped\" the lawmakers' phones and \"spied\" on their communications.",
      "The records, which the FBI analyzed in 2023, enabled investigators to see basic information about the date and time of phone calls but not the content of the communications, the senators said. The senators' phone data that investigators scrutinized came for calls made between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, 2021, and was obtained by Smith through a grand jury subpoena, the senators said.",
      "The document, dated Sept. 27, 2023, lists the Republican lawmakers whose records were allegedly investigated: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.",
      "\"As you know, toll records merely contain telephonic routing information \u2014 collected after the calls have taken place \u2014 identifying incoming and outgoing call numbers, the time of the calls, and their duration. Toll records are historical in nature, and do not include the content of calls,\" Smith's attorneys said. \"It is well established that obtaining telephone toll records pursuant to a subpoena is a routine and lawful investigative step that does not violate an individual's expectation of privacy.\"",
      "Breuer and Koski noted to Grassley that special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated President Biden's handling of classified documents, also obtained telephone toll records of Biden, and that under the first Trump administration, the Justice Department obtained similar records from Rep. Eric Swalwell and then-Rep. Adam Schiff, as well as over 40 congressional staffers during an investigation into media leaks.",
      "Last week, five of the senators whose phone records were obtained by the government wrote a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi asking her to open an investigation into Smith's investigations and refer him to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility.",
      "\"Jack Smith was a rogue Special Counsel,\" the senators wrote, claiming he \"would do anything to stop President Trump \u2014 including taking concerted steps to spy on duly elected members of Congress.\"",
      "\"Without any sufficient rationale or cause, Jack Smith's team used a federal grand jury subpoena to obtain the phone records of sitting United States Senators and a Member of the House of Representatives,\" the senators continued.",
      "According to the indictment of Mr. Trump in the 2020 election probe, part of Smith's investigation into the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol focused on Mr. Trump's alleged attempts, alongside his co-conspirators, to call senators and representatives to pressure them into delaying certification of Biden's Electoral College victory.",
      "Last year, a final report penned by Smith \u2014 which argued the president would have been convicted if not for his 2024 election win \u2014 also pointed to phone calls placed by Mr. Trump and members of his circle.",
      "\"We are confident that an objective assessment of the facts and the law will compel the inescapable conclusion that Mr. Smith's investigative efforts, including his Office's issuance of a grand jury subpoena for telephone toll records, were handled in an entirely lawful and appropriate manner,\" Smith's attorneys wrote.",
      "Smith led the Justice Department probes of Mr. Trump related to his conduct after the 2020 presidential election, as well as his handling of classified records after his first term ended. The cases both resulted in criminal charges against Mr. Trump, and he pleaded not guilty to all charges and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Smith's two cases against Mr. Trump were ultimately closed last year after he won the presidential election because under Justice Department policy, sitting presidents are not prosecuted. Smith left the Justice Department shortly afterwards.",
      "Since resigning from the Justice Department in January, Smith has been the target of investigations from Congressional Republicans like Grassley, and is being investigated for alleged illegal political activity, which his attorneys called \"imaginary and unfounded.\" In an interview earlier this month, Smith said that \"everyone\" who worked on his team was fired by the Trump Justice Department."

      "\"Back then, you could have a simple question, but you couldn't get an easy answer,\" Tyson said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"Now, you can type anything into Google, into ChatGPT. If you have ever seen those replies that come in from AI, it's got no soul. It's got no personality.\"",

      "The letter, released Wednesday by a politically and geographically diverse group of public figures, is squarely aimed at tech giants like Google, OpenAI and Meta Platforms that are racing each other to build a form of artificial intelligence designed to surpass humans at many tasks.",
      "The 30-word statement says, \"We call for a prohibition on the development of superintelligence, not lifted before there is broad scientific consensus that it will be done safely and controllably, and strong public buy-in.\"",
      "In a preamble, the letter notes that AI tools may bring health and prosperity, but alongside those tools, \"many leading AI companies have the stated goal of building superintelligence in the coming decade that can significantly outperform all humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. This has raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"",
      "Prince Harry added in a personal note that \"the future of AI should serve humanity, not replace it. I believe the true test of progress will be not how fast we move, but how wisely we steer. There is no second chance.\"",
      "Signing alongside the Duke of Sussex was his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"This is not a ban or even a moratorium in the usual sense,\" wrote another signatory, Stuart Russell, an AI pioneer and computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \"It's simply a proposal to require adequate safety measures for a technology that, according to its developers, has a significant chance to cause human extinction. Is that too much to ask?\"",
      "Also signing were AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, co-winners of the Turing Award, computer science's top prize. Hinton also won a Nobel Prize in physics last year. Both have been vocal in bringing attention to the dangers of a technology they helped create.",
      "But the list also has some surprises, including Bannon and Beck, in an attempt by the letter's organizers at the nonprofit Future of Life Institute to appeal to President Trump's Make America Great Again movement even as Mr. Trump's White House staff has sought to reduce limits to AI development in the U.S.",
      "Also on the list are Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak; British billionaire Richard Branson; the former Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, who served under Republican and Democratic administrations; and Democratic foreign policy expert Susan Rice, who was national security adviser to President Barack Obama.",
      "Former Irish President Mary Robinson and several British and European parliamentarians signed, as did actors Stephen Fry and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and musician will.i.am, who has otherwise embraced AI in music creation.",
      "Caution urged",
      "\"Yeah, we want specific AI tools that can help cure diseases, strengthen national security, etc.,\" wrote Gordon-Levitt, whose wife Tasha McCauley served on OpenAI's board of directors before the upheaval that led to CEO Sam Altman's temporary ouster in 2023. \"But does AI also need to imitate humans, groom our kids, turn us all into slop junkies and make zillions of dollars serving ads? Most people don't want that.\"",
      "The letter is likely to provoke ongoing debates between the AI research community about the likelihood of superhuman AI, the technical paths to reach it and how dangerous it could be.",
      "\"In the past, it's mostly been the nerds versus the nerds,\" said Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \"I feel what we're really seeing here is how the criticism has gone very mainstream.\"",
      "Labeling is complicating the discourse",
      "Confounding the broader debates is that the same companies that are striving toward what some call superintelligence and others call artificial general intelligence, or AGI, are also sometimes inflating the capabilities of their products, which can make them more marketable and have contributed to concerns about an AI bubble. OpenAI was recently met with ridicule from mathematicians and AI scientists when its researcher claimed ChatGPT had figured out unsolved math problems \u2014 when what it really did was find and summarize what was already online.",
      "\"There's a ton of stuff that's overhyped and you need to be careful as an investor, but that doesn't change the fact that \u2014 zooming out \u2014 AI has gone much faster in the last four years than most people predicted,\" Tegmark said.",
      "Tegmark's group was also behind a March 2023 letter \u2014 still in the dawn of a commercial AI boom \u2014 that called on tech giants to temporarily  pause the development of more powerful AI models. None of the major AI companies heeded that call. And the 2023 letter's most prominent signatory, Elon Musk, was at the same time quietly founding his own AI startup to compete with those he wanted to take a 6-month pause.",
      "Asked if he reached out to Musk again this time, Tegmark said he wrote to the CEOs of all major AI developers in the U.S. but didn't expect them to sign.",
      "\"I really empathize for them, frankly, because they're so stuck in this race to the bottom that they just feel an irresistible pressure to keep going and not get overtaken by the other guy,\" Tegmark said. \"I think that's why it's so important to stigmatize the race to superintelligence, to the point where the U.S. government just steps in.\""

    "summary": "AI companyy said the new browser is now available on Apple laptops that run on macOS and will expand to other platforms soon.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI said Tuesday it is launching an artificial intelligence-powered website browser, heightening the company's competition with Google, the Alphabet-owned unit that has long dominated online search.",
      "The new browser, called ChatGPT Atlas, is for now only available on Apple laptops that run the company's Mac operating system. Access will soon expand to Apple's iOS, Microsoft Windows and Google's Android platforms, OpenAI said.",
      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",
      "\"Ultimately, Google is still the leader in search, but OpenAI's move with Atlas is worth watching,\" she said.",
      "OpenAI has said ChatGPT has more than 800 million users, although the San Francisco-based company has yet to turn a profit. Google's Chrome browser has roughly 3 billion worldwide users and has been adding some AI features drawing on the company's Gemini AI technology."

      "Warner Bros. in recent weeks rejected a bid from Paramount Skydance, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News\u00a0and other media outlets (Paramount Skydance owns CBS News).",
      "Warner Bros.' stock price jumped in early trading, rising nearly 10% to $20.12. The shares have climbed 91% this year, especially in recent weeks as speculation has grown on Wall Street that the company was in play.",
      "The company's market value on Tuesday hovered around $49 billion, and Wall Street analysts estimate that the price of any deal to buy Warner Bros. would likely top $60 billion.",
      "Split or sell?",
      "In June, Warner Bros. announced that it planned to split into two companies by mid-2026, one focusing on streaming and films, and the other housing TV services/channels brands including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav said Tuesday that the restructuring remains on track.",

Tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and Netflix, all of which produce streaming content, are less likely to explore a deal, according to the the investment advisory firm.",
      "\"[W]e do expect the demand for Warner Bros. streaming and studio to command a premium multiple,\" the analysts said in a note to investors. \"Whether multiple bidders emerge for just these assets will likely determine if the price can reach levels high enough to move forward with this alternative plan.\""

      "Amazon says a massive outage of its cloud computing service has been resolved as of Monday evening, after a problem disrupted internet use around the world, taking down a broad range of online services, including social media, gaming, food delivery, streaming and financial platforms.",
      "The all-day disruption and the ensuing exasperation it caused served as the latest reminder that 21st century society is increasingly dependent on just a handful of companies for much of its internet technology, which seems to work reliably until it suddenly breaks down.",
      "About three hours after the outage began early Monday morning, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to recover, but it wasn't until 6 p.m. Eastern that \"services returned to normal operations,\" Amazon said on its AWS health website, where it tracks outages.",
      "Cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple said \"a slow and bumpy recovery process\" is \"entirely normal.\"",

      "Even Amazon's own services weren't immune. Users of the company's Ring doorbell cameras and Alexa-powered smart speakers posted on DownDetector that they weren't working, while others said they were unable to access the Amazon website or download books to their Kindle.",
      "By mid-morning, Amazon said it had started to recover, but around 1 p.m. ET, users were still reporting problems. Thousands of Venmo users reported difficulties at about 1:30 p.m. ET, while people also reported problems with AI chatbot Claude, the Wall Street Journal and Amazon services like Alexa around the same time, according to Downdetector.",

      "\"An Amazon Web Services outage is impacting information in Transit app. The length of disruption is currently unknown. We apologize for any inconvenience,\" said RTC Southern Nevada, the transit authority for the region, on X at 1:54 p.m. ET.",
      "The outage also had ripple effects in the travel industry, with major airline carriers\u00a0reporting issues.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the outage affected the airline's ability to efficiently dispatch some early morning flights, while United said it disrupted customers' access to the United app and website overnight. Delta said the issue caused a small numbers of minor delays Monday morning.",
      "The nation's railroad services were also affected. Amtrak reported at 1:30 p.m. EDT that it was experiencing \"intermittent technical difficulties\" which hobbled SMS, email and push notifications, and prevented customers from booking reservations through Amtrak.com or the mobile app.",
      "\"If you are traveling today, please arrive at your station at your regularly scheduled time typically 30 minutes prior to your train's departure,\" Amtrak said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "How did this start?",
      "Amazon first reported the outage issue at 3:11 a.m. ET. Shortly after, it said its services in its eastern U.S. region were disrupted and engineers were working to understand what was causing the problem. At 5:27 a.m. ET, AWS began reporting progress, saying, \"We are seeing significant signs of recovery.\"",
      "A little more than a half-hour later, it said, \"We continue to observe recovery across most\" of the affected services.",

      "\"The world now runs on the cloud\" and the internet is seen as a utility like water or electricity as we spend so much of our lives on our smartphones, Burgess said.",
      "And because so much of the online world's plumbing is underpinned by a handful of companies, when something goes wrong \"it's very difficult for users to pinpoint what is happening because we don't see Amazon, we just see Snapchat or Roblox,\" Burgess said."

    "story": [
      "States are warning struggling Americans who rely on food stamps to pay for groceries that they may miss out on benefits come November.",
      "\"Starting October 16, SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] benefits will not be paid until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released to PA,\" reads a\u00a0notice from the Pennsylvania state website.",
      "New Jersey,\u00a0Maryland, New York and\u00a0Texas are among the other states that have issued similar notices.",
      "The wave of announcements come after the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal food stamps program, issued a letter to state agencies on Oct. 10 saying that if the lapse in appropriations continues, there will be \"insufficient funds\" to pay full November SNAP benefits.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS News to the USDA, which then shared the letter it sent to states. Both declined to comment on what a lapse in funding could mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the program.",
      "Advocates and SNAP recipients have warned the effects of being cut off from nutrition assistance could be devastating.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, interim director for SNAP at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit focused on ending hunger, said delayed SNAP benefits would mean individuals have to make extreme choices such as whether to pay their rent or feed their kids. Many recipients, she said, are living paycheck to paycheck and that's the reason they depend on SNAP.",
      "According to the USDA, 73% of SNAP recipients had a gross monthly income at or below 100% of the poverty level in fiscal year 2023.",
      "While the majority of beneficiaries are not expected to work while on SNAP, primarily because they are children, older adults or disabled people, most SNAP participants who can work do so, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, said in an April report.",
      "How SNAP benefits are normally administered",
      "Over 40 million Americans are enrolled in SNAP. Recipients, on average, receive a payment of $187 (or roughly $6 per day) on prepaid cards that they can use\u00a0to buy produce, meat, dairy and other household food staples.",
      "While SNAP is a federally funded program run by the USDA, states are responsible for administering benefits and setting their own disbursement dates. As described by The Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) on its website, the program is a \"delicate partnership of public and private entities.\"",
      "To ensure benefits are available at the first of every month, states send electronic case files with information on SNAP recipients on a monthly basis to an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) vendor so they can process the data and load recipients' cards.",
      "\"EBT processors have to get all of this data in time,\" Plata-Nino explained. \"They need to be able to process the payment so when that person utilizes their card at that EBT retailer, the money will be there for the retailer to be able to swipe.\"",
      "The shutdown, however, has thrown a wrench in the process. In its letter to state agencies on Oct. 10, the USDA directed states to hold off on sending electronic files to EBT vendors \"until further notice.\" The pause opens the door to possible delays and disruptions in November benefits.",
      "That could be an issue for SNAP recipients like Deb Powers, a 66-year-old Massachusetts resident who receives around $260 a month in SNAP benefits. Powers said she'll be OK if benefits don't come through in November, but a longer delay would force her to change how she shops. The fresh produce she buys to keep a healthy diet would no longer be in her budget, she said.",
      "\"Letting people go hungry is a choice, and it's not a good one,\" Powers told CBS News.",
      "Contingency funding",
      "One way for the USDA to cover SNAP costs, explained Plata-Nino, would be for the agency to tap into its contingency funds. According to FRAC, the reserve stood at $6 billion during the Biden administration.",
      "After Democrats and Republicans\u00a0failed to come to an agreement to extend government funding on Oct. 1, 2025, the USDA said in its Lapse of Funding\u00a0plan that the SNAP program has been provided for with multiyear contingency funds that could be used to cover state administrative expenses during a federal government shutdown.",
      "\"These multiyear contingency funds are also available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year,\" the plan states.",
      "However, it's unclear if the USDA plans to utilize those funds to ensure November SNAP benefits. The agency did not respond to CBS News' request for comment on whether that option is under consideration.",
      "During the government shutdowns in 2018 and 2019, the USDA disbursed SNAP funds early to prevent benefits from running out, Plata-Nino said.",
      "\"This administration didn't do any of that [this time], but they still have the contingency funding ...\" Plata-Nino said. \"They have the money, so it really is a policy choice.\"",
      "It's also possible states could attempt to free up money from their own budgets to bridge the gap, although approval would be an uphill battle given that it costs tens to hundreds of millions of dollars monthly to cover SNAP benefits. Whether states would get that money back is unclear.",
      "Peter Hadler, the deputy commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Social Services, told lawmakers in his state Thursday that he doesn't expect the federal government to ever reimburse states.",
      "The fate of WIC funding",
      "Another social safety net program that could be affected by the government shutdown is the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. Known as WIC, the program provides nutrition assistance, including infant formula, to around 6.7 million people.",
      "The National WIC Association (NWA), the nonprofit education arm for the government program, warned Tuesday that millions of families could lose access to their WIC benefits as early as Nov. 1, when certain state agencies are set to run out of funds.",
      "The group said the White House provided temporary emergency funds that will stabilize the program through Oct. 31, but noted that those funds are rapidly depleting. To keep the programing running for the first two weeks of November, an additional $300 million is needed, according to NWA.",
      "\"Without additional funding, State WIC Agencies may be forced to take drastic measures that prevent families from accessing the services they need, such as halting food benefits,\" NWA said in a statement."

      "\"Going to a tattoo removal place is going to take a while,\" he said. \"I wanted this thing off my body.\"",
      "The initial tattoo image resembled a specific symbol of Hitler's paramilitary Schutzstaffel, or SS, which was responsible for the systematic murders of millions of Jews and others in Europe during World War II. Platner didn't offer details about the new tattoo, but offered to send the AP a photo later Wednesday.",
      "The tattoo revelation closely follows the discovery of a series of controversial online statements on Reddit, including one in which he dismissed sexual assault in the military. Platner attempted to explain his past online comments in a video he posted to X last week. In it, he addressed not only his previous comments dismissing military sexual assaults, but also his questioning Black patrons' gratuity habits and criticizing police officers and rural Americans.",
      "\"As I read through them, I read things that I absolutely do not agree with,\" Platner said in a five-minute apology video. \"I read through and I see things that \u2014 words and statements that I abhor. I also see the trajectory of my life.\"",
      "Platner also told Pod Save America that his past Reddit comments were intended to \"get a rise out of people on the Internet\" and \"weren't even reflective of my opinions back then.\"",
      "He has resisted calls to drop out of the race and has the backing of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has described Platner as a stronger candidate for the seat than Mills.",
      "Platner said he was not ashamed to confront his past comments and actions because it reflects the lessons he needed to take to get where he is today.",
      "\"I don't look at this as a liability,\" he told the AP. \"I look at this as is a life that I have lived, a journey that has been difficult, that has been full of struggle, that has also gotten me to where I am today. And I'm very proud of who I am.\"",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin was asked over the weekend, before the tattoo revelation, if Platner's past comments are disqualifying.",
      "\"I don't think they're disqualifying, but certainly they're not right,\" Martin said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" And I'm glad that he apologized for them. They're indefensible, they're hurtful, and they're offensive. The question, though, is I believe in second chances. I believe a lot of people say things at their most vulnerable times. They say things when they're young that again are offensive. And the question for me is whether or not they actually learn from them, whether or not they actually reflect on those, that they're sincere in their apology, and more importantly that they have changed their behavior.\"",
      "Platner has a planned town hall Wednesday in Ogunquit, Maine."

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, began delivering a marathon speech on the Senate floor Tuesday evening, speaking overnight and into the morning Wednesday in protest of President Trump's policies.",
      "Merkley, 68, began speaking at 6:21 p.m. on Tuesday and railed against the Trump administration through the night for its deportation efforts, canceled federal programs, so-called weaponization of the Justice Department and efforts to send the National Guard into American cities \u2014 including Portland, Oregon.",
      "\"I've come to the Senate floor tonight to ring the alarm bells,\" Merkley said at the outset of his speech. \"We're in the most perilous moment, the biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War. President Trump is shredding our Constitution.\"",
      "New Jersey Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker, along with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell, Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, took turns asking Merkley extended questions late Tuesday and Wednesday morning, giving him brief breaks.",
      "Portland, which Merkley represents, has been a target of Mr. Trump's ire for years and again came into focus last month, when the president directed the Defense Department to coordinate the deployment of National Guard troops to the city. On Monday, a federal appeals court cleared the way for the administration to federalize and deploy members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while a legal challenge moves forward.",
      "\"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland, Oregon, in my home state, is full of chaos and riots because if he can say to the American people that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion,\" Merkley said. \"And if there's a rebellion, he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation. Pretend there are riots, or even try to provoke violence, and tighten his authoritarian grip.\"",
      "Merkley said Portlanders aren't \"taking the bait.\" Instead, he said, \"they are demonstrating with joy and whimsy.\"",
      "\"They want to make it clear to the world that what Trump is saying about there being violent protests or a rebellion in Portland is just not true,\" he added.",
      "The remarks come as Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over how to fund the government, with the shutdown stretching into a fourth week Wednesday. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, criticized the speech in a post on X before it began Tuesday evening, highlighting that Capitol Police are not being paid.",
      "\"The Democrats are going to make Capitol Police and Capitol support staff\u00a0\u2014\u00a0who they refuse to pay\u00a0\u2014\u00a0work all night so they can give speeches patting themselves on the back for shutting down the government and hurting the American people,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Merkley's marathon address follows a record-breaking speech\u00a0by Booker on the Senate floor earlier this year, spanning more than 25 hours. The speech was also made in a protest against the Trump administration's policies. In 2017, Merkley delivered one of the longest Senate floor speeches on record when he spoke for more than 15 hours to oppose the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch."

      "In a notice\u00a0posted\u00a0on the agency's website late Monday, USCIS explains what types of visa applicants must pay the new six-figure fee and who is exempt. Applications for H-1B visas filed on or after Sept. 21 for workers outside the U.S. and who are not current H-1B visa holders are subject to the $100,000 charge, USCIS said.",
      "The fee also applies if a petition filed on or after Sept. 21 \"requests consular notification, port of entry notification or pre-flight inspection for an alien in the United States.\"",
      "The $100,000 payment must be paid prior to applying for an H-1B visa, according to USCIS.",

      "In announcing the new H-1B policy on Sept. 19, President Trump said the new fee was necessary \"to address the abuse of that program while still permitting companies to hire the best of the best temporary foreign workers.\" He also said some employers take advantage of the visa program to undercut U.S. workers' wages by hiring lower-paid foreign workers.",
      "The Trump administration has said the $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will compel U.S. companies to hire Americans, instead of relying on labor from overseas. Many economists, however, expect mixed results.",

    "summary": "Financial pros recommend waiting as long as possible to claim your Social Security benefits. Most Americans say they're ignoring that advice.",
    "story": [
      "Nine in 10 working Americans say they plan to ignore one of the most common pieces of financial advice about Social Security: waiting until age 70 to claim benefits, which ensures higher monthly payments, according to a new study from investment firm Schroders.",
      "Social Security allows employees to claim their benefits as soon as they turn 62, years before the so-called \"full retirement age,\" which now stands at 67. But claiming Social Security early has a tradeoff \u2014 it lowers your monthly payment by about 30%, with those lower benefits locked in for the rest of your life.",
      "By contrast, delaying Social Security until age 70 results in a roughly 24% higher monthly payment than if you claimed benefits at age 67 \u2014 also locked in as long you're collecting benefits. As a result, financial experts often recommend that seniors hold off as long as they can, with one study finding that filing early for benefits can cost $182,000 in foregone payments.",
      "The Schroders survey\u00a0suggests that many Americans who haven't yet retired aren't buying that advice. In the survey of 1,500 adults, most respondents said they understand the trade-offs of claiming early, but only 10% plan to wait until age 70, while 44% expect to file for benefits before they reach full retirement age.",
      "Social Security provides an online calculator that lets users plug in their birthdate, then calculate the percentage difference in their monthly payment based on the age at which they plan to claim the retirement benefit.",
      "Another\u00a0new study, released Tuesday by the Allianz Center for the Future of Retirement, finds that a majority of Americans say they don't know much about Social Security or how it will fit into their retirement plan. And about 1 in 5 believe Social Security will provide all the retirement income they need, even though it generally replaces only 40% of a worker's wages when they retire, the study found.",
      "\"Not an oversight\"",
      "The disconnect illustrates the financial reality facing most workers, Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at Schroders, told CBS News.",
      "\"The decision to sacrifice extra Social Security income is not an oversight for most Americans,\" she said. \"According to our research, 70% of Americans are aware that waiting longer to claim Social Security leads to higher payments, and yet so few are willing to hold off.\"",
      "Many retirees are facing a shortfall in their own retirement savings, a financial gap that's been well documented as a growing share of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Many workers \"need the income generated by Social Security to meet their expenses immediately upon retiring,\" Boyden noted.",
      "Why many seniors start Social Security early",
      "While the advice to wait as long as possible to claim Social Security makes financial sense, it also doesn't fully account for people's individual needs and circumstances. Many older adults claim benefits early out of financial necessity, while others may do so because health issues or chronic conditions lead them to expect a shorter-than-average lifespan.",
      "Some seniors also weigh the so-called break-even point \u2014 the age at which the total money you've collected from starting benefits early equals what you would have collected if you had delayed claiming Social Security in oder to get a higher monthly check. In other words, someone who starts collecting at 62 will have banked eight years of benefits, as opposed to claiming at age 70.",
      "Based on today's average monthly Social Security benefit of $2,000, that early claimer would receive a reduced benefit of about $1,400 a month. Over the following eight years, that would amount to $134,400 in total benefits received by the time the person started collecting Social Security at age 70.",
      "By filing for benefits at 70, that individual would receive a monthly payment $2,480, but it would take 10.4 years for the extra amount in their monthly payment to surpass the $134,400 that an early filer collected in the prior eight years. That makes the break-even age about 80.4 years old.",
      "The upshot Some seniors, especially those with health issues, might decide they're unlikely to reach that break-even age and opt to have money in their pockets earlier rather than waiting to start collecting Social Security.",
      "The average life expectancy for a 62-year-old man today is an additional 22 years, or about age 83.6, while a woman the same age is expected to live to around 86.5, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "Concerns about Social Security's future",
      "There's another reason why many Americans plan on claiming their Social Security benefits before reaching full retirement age, she added. That's due to concerns about the future of Social Security, which is fueling concerns that \"the money may not be there if they wait,\" Boyden said.",
      "Social Security is indeed facing a financial crunch, with an aging U.S. population resulting in its payments now outpacing contributions from workers. Without changes to the program, that will result in its trust funds becoming insolvent by 2034, according to the most recent calculation from the Social Security Board of Trustees.",
      "Yet many people wrongly believe that means Social Security will halt payments if the trust funds become insolvent. Payments would continue in such an event, but benefits would be reduced by about 20% \u2014 a potentially major financial hit to the program's more than 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "Still, there are ways lawmakers can shore up the program, such as by raising the income cap on Social Security taxes, which stands at $176,100, according to experts. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "In the meantime, non-retired Americans told Schroders they believe they need $5,032 in monthly income to retire comfortably. But today's retirees on average generate about $3,250 in monthly retirement income, Boyden said, adding that the gap signals the need to help workers plan better for retirement.",
      "A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs found three-quarters of younger working Americans say they're struggling to save for retirement because basic expenses such as housing are eating up a bigger share of their income compared with prior generations."

    "summary": "Experts say the incident revealed what can happen when a such a broad spectrum of companies rely on singular cloud provider.",
    "story": [
      "The 15-hour\u00a0disruption to Amazon Web Services, a cloud-based computing service, on Monday shook internet users around the world, disrupting everything from travel to financial transactions \u2014 and underscoring the fragility of a system reliant on only a handful of tech giants.",
      "Monday's problems at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, spawned 11 million total outage reports, with 3 million reports stemming from U.S. users, Downdetector, a website that tracks online outages,\u00a0said\u00a0on Facebook.",
      "While other cloud providers support the world's businesses \u2014 including Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure \u2014 AWS has the largest foothold in the market. Since it debuted in 2006, the company has grown to control 38% of the cloud computing infrastructure market,\u00a0according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "Experts say Monday's outage reveals the vulnerabilities of a system where a small number of companies provide such a large chunk of the internet's backbone.",
      "\"[The] outage is a stark reminder of the massive 'concentration risk' the global economy has accepted by building on a handful of cloud providers,\" Dave McCarthy, who leads global research for cloud services at the International Data Corporation, told CBS News.",
      "AWS' rolodex of customers include government departments, universities and businesses, and platforms such as Venmo, Netflix and Snapchat.",
      "\"Frankly, many customers may have been unaware that a service they used relied upon AWS and are only learning that now, due to system failures,\" said Craig Shue, a professor and the head of the computer science department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.",
      "As Shue explained, companies that are not technology-centric may seek out a cloud service like AWS to host their web servers and databases, allowing them to focus on their day-to-day operations. Amazon, meanwhile,\u00a0 handles the more technical aspects such as server maintenance and responses to fluctuations in customer demand, he added.",
      "Amazon declined to comment directly on the incident, instead sharing a statement from their\u00a0website\u00a0published on Oct. 20.",
      "How the AWS outage started",
      "The outage started Monday morning in Northern Virginia, home to AWS' oldest and biggest cloud computing hub in the U.S. AWS refers to the cluster of data centers in Virginia as US-EAST-1. The company also has cloud computing hubs in California, Ohio and Oregon.",
      "According to expert accounts and Amazon's own\u00a0explanation, the issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system (DNS) servers. As Shue explained, this is the part of the internet that takes domain names like Amazon.com and converts them to IP addresses, numerical labels that identify locations on the internet.",
      "The service can be used to distribute traffic to multiple servers to make things faster, Shue said.",
      "\"It is akin to waiting in a checkout line that then splits off to multiple cashier lanes,\" Shue explained. \"A staff member can direct the customer at the front of the line to the first available server that can handle the job.\"",
      "This function was disrupted on Monday, leading to a backlog of server requests without anything to route them. It's still unclear how the disruption began, experts said.",
      "For people on the ground, this meant they were unable to carry out simple web-based functions like checking their flight time on an airline app or sending a payment on Venmo.",
      "While the issue started in the eastern U.S. region, its effects were global. Experts say it's difficult to quantify the impact in dollar figures. McCarthy, however, noted that it appears to be one of the most significant outages in recent years.",
      "Amazon said that the issue was resolved around 6 p.m. EDT on Monday, or more than 15 hours after the company first reported a problem on the AWS Health Dashboard, where it tracks service disruptions.",
      "\"This wasn't a minor glitch; it was a cascading failure originating in US-EAST-1, the very nerve center of AWS, which took down everything from gaming and social media to critical financial and educational platforms,\" he said.",
      "Will the outage impact AWS?",
      "While the incident may have sparked a small reckoning with cloud services, it's not expected to shake up the landscape too much, experts told CBS News.",
      "McCarthy doesn't expect the outage to lead to a mass exodus of AWS customers, but he said it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services so they're not reliant on a single provider. That way if one goes down, the company can still keep some operations going."

      "In the company's launch\u00a0video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as an AI-powered web browser built around ChatGPT that will allow people to converse with web pages. In a video presentation, he also expressed confidence that a chatbot interface will eventually supplant a traditional browser's URL bar.",
      "\"Tabs were great, but we haven't seen a lot of browser innovation since then,\" he said.",
      "What the Atlas browser can do",
      "Like other search engines, Atlas has a home page with a search bar where people can ask questions, similar to Google's landing page. Users can also toggle through different tabs across the top of the browser to find news stories, images and other content.",
      "But a few features set the browser apart, according to OpenAI. One is a ChatGPT side bar, which users can activate by clicking an \"Ask ChatGPT\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the browser.",
      "\"It's basically you inviting ChatGPT into your corner of the internet,\" said Ryan O'Rouke, the lead designer for Atlas, in OpenAI's video unveiling the browser.",
      "The technology functions like ChatGPT but takes into account what web page people are on. In practice, that means users can ask questions about whatever content they are looking at. Users can also call on the ChatGPT function while drafting emails. In the demo, O'Rouke shows how he uses it to ask for edits on an email.",
      "\"It's using the internet for you,\" Altman said.",
      "Atlas also has an \"agent mode\" that can take action on a person's behalf, armed with what it has learned from users' browsing history and what they are searching for. The agent also can help people complete a range of tasks, such as booking a flight, editing a document or ordering groceries. For now, agent mode is only available for plus and pro users, according to Altman.",
      "Competition with Google",
      "Whether Atlas will erode Google's dominance in browsing and searching the internet remains to be seen.",
      "Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, said Google is expected to generate $220 billion in search revenues this fiscal year alone. But OpenAI is a potentially formidable competitor, she noted.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Freedom of Information Act requests",
      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",

The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "published": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 08:41:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists say the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs on imports are boosting consumer prices in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration tariffs imposed this year on dozens of nations and a range of industries are fueling inflation, especially for goods that are widely imported into the U.S., a recent\u00a0analysis\u00a0shows.",
      "Product categories seeing some of the biggest price hikes due to tariffs include\u00a0furniture, car parts, electronics and musical instruments, according to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The findings are based on research models estimating tariff-related price hikes and drawing on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, a widely used gauge of inflation.",
      "Importers bear the cost of tariffs, typically passing at least some of the added expenses to consumers, economic research shows.",
      "The St. Louis Fed researchers found that companies passed 35% of tariff costs onto consumers from May through July. Other research from Goldman Sachs suggests that businesses could eventually pass on as much as 55% of added tariff costs to consumers. Companies would swallow 22% of the extra costs, while foreign exporters would absorb 18% of the expenses, economists with the investment bank found.",
      "How much could inflation rise?",
      "Businesses are expected to continue experimenting with pricing based on how tariffs affect their own costs, according to Max Dvorkin, an economist and one of the authors the St. Louis Fed study.",
      "\"Even if you don't change tariffs anymore, the dynamics of prices will continue to evolve and affect consumers over the next few months,\" he said.",
      "The regional Fed bank found that tariffs account for a sizable share of recent inflation. Between June through August, the tariffs imposed by President Trump added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate, which averaged 2.85% during that period, according to the findings. The levies added 0.4 percentage points to core PCE, which excludes volatile energy and food prices and which hovered around 2.9% during that three-month period, the study found.",
      "\"Tariff measures are already exerting measurable upward pressure on consumer prices,\" the economists conclude.",
      "As of August, the Consumer Price Index was up 2.9% from a year ago after, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Inflation as measured by the index had fallen in April to a low of 2.3%, but has flared during the second half of the year. The Labor Department is expected to release CPI data for September, which has been delayed by the government shutdown, on Friday.",
      "The St. Louis Fed study notes that tariffs haven't driven up consumer prices as sharply as some experts had predicted. That's chiefly because many businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates settle before they adjust their prices, according to the research.",
      "\"We believe the passthrough of tariff increases by U.S. businesses to consumers remains in the early stages, delayed by stop-and-go announcements, pauses and drawn-out implementation,\" anaysts with the Wells Fargo Investment Institute said in a report on Tuesday.",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment. President Trump has defended his administration's trade policy, saying that it will benefit the country's manufacturing sector and boost job growth over the long-term.",
      "Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs will cost businesses in the U.S. an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers shouldering most of those costs, according to S&P Global\u00a0analysts\u00a0who reviewed data from 9,000 companies.",
      "Companies have passed on roughly two-thirds of those tariff costs \u2014 $592 billion \u2014 to consumers in the form of higher prices, S&P said. The levies have reduced corporate earnings by a total of $315 billion."

    "summary": "Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir shares a personal account of the story that made headlines worldwide: her accusations against Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "In her posthumously published memoir, Virginia Roberts Giuffre shares a personal account of the story that made headlines worldwide: her accusations against Prince Andrew and years of alleged trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice\" was released on Tuesday. Guiffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the book:",
      "More details about Prince Andrew",
      "Giuffre's book alleges that she had sex with Prince Andrew three times, including when she was 17, after being trafficked by Epstein. One time, she said, was part of an orgy involving around eight other girls.",
      "\"The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of eighteen and didn't really speak English,\" Giuffre said.",
      "She said that, as her legal case progressed, Andrew made it difficult for her legal team to serve him papers by \"fleeing to Queen Elizabeth's Balmoral Castle in Scotland and hiding behind its well-guarded gates.\" Andrew denied her allegations.",
      "But a turning point came with Andrew's November 2019 interview on the BBC program Newsnight. He was widely criticized for seeming to lack empathy when asked about the accusations, and Giuffre says the interview \"was like an injection of jet fuel\" for her legal team.",
      "\"Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "She said her settlement negotiations with Andrew began to move quickly after he hired American lawyer Andrew Brettler, who had worked with other public figures facing #MeToo allegations.",
      "Brettler \"was less reluctant than some of his British counterparts to face reality,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "Giuffre said she and her team were asking for more than money as part of the settlement: They wanted an acknowledgement of what Giuffre had been through.",
      "\"After casting doubt on my credibility for so long \u2014 Prince Andrew's team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me \u2014 the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well. We would never get a confession, of course.\"",
      "The settlement was announced on Feb. 15, 2022, and Prince Andrew and Giuffre issued a joint statement which made clear he would pay Giuffre money, but didn't specify the amount. It also said he would make a \"substantial donation\" in support of victims' rights to Giuffre's nonprofit organization. Andrew did not admit wrongdoing but said in court documents that he \"regrets his association with Epstein.\"",
      "\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "Last week, ahead of the publication of Giuffre's memoir, Prince Andrew announced he would no longer use his Duke of York title, after already having stepped back from royal duties in 2019.",
      "Mar-a-Lago and a meeting with Trump",
      "Before she first encountered Gislaine Maxwell and was brought into Epstein's world, in 2000, Giuffre worked at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, alongside her father, who was a maintenance man responsible for the air conditioning units in hotel rooms, as well as the clay tennis courts.",
      "\"I remember he gave me a brief tour before presenting me to the hiring manager who \u2014 after I passed both a drug test and a polygraph \u2014 agreed to take me on,\" Giuffre wrote. She said she met Mr. Trump a few days after starting work at the resort.",
      "\"They weren't friends exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that,\" Giuffre said.",
      "When she met Mr. Trump in his office, she said he \"couldn't have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic I was there.\"",
      "He also asked if she babysat, Guiffre wrote, mentioning families with children who stayed in his properties nearby.",
      "But it was also at Mar-a-Lago that Giuffre said she first met Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "\"One steaming hot day some weeks before my seventeenth birthday, I was walking toward the Mar-a-Lago spa, on my way to work, when a car slowed behind me. I wish I could say that I sensed that something evil was tracking me, but as I headed into the building, I had no inkling of the danger I was in,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Maxwell jumped out of the car and introduced herself to Giuffre.",
      "\"I wish I could say that I saw through Maxwell's polished facade \u2014 that, like a horse, I intuited the immense threat she posed to me. Instead, my first impression of Maxwell was the same one I formed when I greeted any well-heeled Mar-a-Lago guest. I'd be lucky, I thought, if I could grow up to be anything like her.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking conspiracy, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein died in jail in 2019 after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied knowledge of Epstein and Maxwell's activities.",
      "Giuffre's message to the world",
      "Giuffre writes about how the abuse she was subjected to affected her and how she dedicated herself to standing up those who harmed her and supporting others to do the same.",
      "\"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what Epstein was doing,\" Guiffre said at the end of the book. \"Anyone who spent any significant amount of time with Epstein saw him touching girls in ways you wouldn't want a creepy old man touching your daughter. They can say they didn't know he was raping children. But they were not blind. (Not to mention the fact that many prominent people were still associating with him years after).\"",
      "Though it was difficult, Guiffre said she was glad she had worked to share her story.",
      "\"I don't regret it, but the constant telling and retelling has been extremely painful and exhausting,\" she said.",
      "Guiffre leaves readers with this message:",
      "\"I hope my story has moved you \u2014 to seek ways to free yourself from a bad situation, say, to stand up for someone else in need, or to simply reframe how you judge victims of sexual abuse. Each one of us can make positive change. I truly believe that. I hope for a world in which predators are punished, not protected; victims are treated with compassion, not shamed; and powerful people face the same consequences as anyone else. I yearn, too, for a world in which perpetrators face more shame than their victims do and where anyone who's been trafficked can confront their abusers when they are ready, no matter how much time has passed. We don't live in this world yet. \u2026 If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that \u2014 if it helps just one person \u2014 I will have achieved my goal.\""

    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014 Multiple security sources in the West African nation of Niger told CBS News on Wednesday that an American national was kidnapped from his home in the capital Niamey on Tuesday night.",
      "They said the abduction by unknown assailants took place only about 100 yards from the presidential palace in Niamey, where ousted President Mohamed Bazoum has been held since he was toppled by a coup more than two years ago.",
      "Sources told CBS News the man abducted on Tuesday is a missionary who has worked for years for a U.S.-based charity.",
      "CBS News has asked the U.S. State Department for any information it can provide about the apparent abduction.",
      "The sources said the American was kidnapped by three unidentified armed men.",
      "Messages circulating among security officials in Niamey suggested the American had been working in Niger since 2010.",
      "There has been no known demand from any kidnappers, nor any official response from the Nigerien government nor the U.S. Embassy in Niamey.",
      "The apparent kidnapping comes two years after a July 2023 coup that removed Bazoum and brought General Abdourahamane Tiani to power, with his military junta vowing to restore security.",
      "Sources told CBS News the back door of the presidential palace is just a few hundred yards from where the kidnapping took place, in the capital's highly secured Plateau district.",
      "Sources told CBS News that Basoum has been held in the palace since his ouster, living in two rooms with no windows and no outside contact permitted by the military junta apart from an occasional doctor's visit. Tiani has stayed in a military barracks not far from the residential palace since seizing power.",
      "Security officials in the region have speculated that the abduction could be the work of the ISIS affiliate in the region, the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, which operates in the area along the shared borders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.",
      "From Niamey, it is only about a one-hour drive to the Burkina Faso border, and two hours to the Malian border.",
      "Multiple Nigerien sources said Wednesday that the abduction was carried out by \"three armed individuals\" who \"neutralized the guard before taking over their victim and quickly leaving the scene.\"",
      "They said the kidnapped American's phone was tracked less than an hour after the abduction late Tuesday night to a location about 56 miles north of Niamey \u2014 in an area \"considered a sanctuary for groups affiliated with the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara\" between the Nigerien capital and the Malian border.",
      "All three of the neighboring states have seen military regimes overthrow civilian rule within the last half of a decade, along with Gabon and Guinea, earning the region of West and Central Africa the dubious moniker of Africa's \"coup belt.\""

    "story": [
      "Mosquitoes have been discovered in Iceland for the first time, a researcher told the AFP Monday. The volcanically active country has long been one of the world's few mosquito-free places.",
      "Three Culiseta annulata mosquitoes, two females and one male, were sighted around 20 miles north of Reykjavik, the country's capital, according to Matth\u00edas Alfre\u00f0sson, an entomologist at the Natural Science Institute of Iceland.",
      "\"They were all collected from wine ropes ... aimed at attracting moths,\" the researcher said in an email, referring to a method of adding sugar to heated wine and dipping ropes or strips of fabric into the solution, which are then hung outside to entice the sweet-toothed insects.",
      "The Icelandic Monitor, a local paper, reported that the insects had been found in a residential backyard. Bj\u00f6rn Hjaltason said he spotted the mosquitoes over multiple days. He captured the bugs and sent them to Alfre\u00f0sson for identification, the outlet reported.",

      "Rising temperatures, longer summers and milder winters, all brought on by climate change, create a more favorable environment for mosquitoes to thrive. Iceland has taken major steps to fight climate change, including opening a large carbon capture facility and establishing the planet's first direct air capture plant.",
      "But Alfredsson did not believe that a warmer climate explained the discovery. The species \"appears to be well adapted to colder climates,\" he said, which \"allows them to withstand long, harsh winters when temperatures drop below freezing.\"",

    "summary": "A 24-year-old woman was arrested in Barcelona over the break-in and theft of gold worth more than $1 million, the Paris prosecutor said.",
    "story": [
      "A Chinese woman has been arrested and charged over the theft of gold from the Natural History Museum in Paris, in one of several recent high-profile break-ins targeting French cultural institutions, a prosecutor said Tuesday.",
      "The theft \u2014 by what the museum's director at the time said was an \"extremely professional team\" \u2014 took place on Sept. 16, a little over a month before an audacious jewelry heist at the world-famous Louvre museum on Sunday.",
      "A 24-year-old Chinese woman was arrested in Barcelona on Sept. 30 over the Natural History Museum break-in and theft of gold worth more than $1 million, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said.",
      "The suspect was handed over to French authorities on Oct. 13 and was charged with theft and criminal conspiracy and put in provisional detention the same day.",
      "Investigations showed she had left France the day of the break-in and was preparing to return to China.",
      "At the time of her arrest, she was trying to dispose of nearly one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of melted gold pieces, the prosecutor said, without providing more details.",
      "The Natural History Museum curator discovered the theft of exhibited gold nuggets after a cleaner reported debris on site.",
      "The stolen items included nuggets from Bolivia donated in the 18th century, from Russia's Ural region gifted by Tsar Nicholas I in 1833, and from California dating to the gold rush era.",
      "A five-kilogram nugget from Australia discovered in 1990 was also taken, Beccuau said.",
      "Nearly six kilograms of native gold was stolen, with damages estimated at 1.5 million euros ($1.7 million), she added, noting that the historical and scientific value of the pieces was \"priceless.\"",
      "Native gold is a metal alloy containing gold and silver in their natural, unrefined form.",
      "Investigators found two museum doors had been cut with a grinder and the display case breached using a blowtorch.",
      "Tools including a blowtorch, grinder, screwdriver, gas cylinders and saws were recovered nearby.",
      "Surveillance footage showed a lone intruder entering the museum shortly after 1 a.m. and leaving around 4 a.m., according to Beccuau.",
      "The investigation is ongoing, she added.",
      "Police are also still on the hunt for thieves who stole priceless royal jewels from the Louvre museum in a spectacular daylight robbery on Sunday. Officials said Tuesday the jewels are worth an estimated $102 million not including their historical value to France.",
      "The heist has reignited a row over a lack of security in France's museums, which have suffered a spate of break-ins in recent months.",
      "In early September, thieves snatched three porcelain works worth millions of dollars and classed as national treasures in a heist at the Adrien Dubouche National Museum in Limoges in central France.",
      "Last November, four men with axes and baseball bats smashed the display cases in broad daylight at the Cognacq-Jay museum in Paris, making off with several 18th-century works. That heist resulted in an insurance payment of over $4 million to the Royal Collection Trust,\u00a0BBC News reported.",
      "The\u00a0next day, jewelry valued at several million dollars was stolen during an armed robbery at a museum in Saone-et-Loire in central France."

      "Alejandro Carranza's loved ones say he left home on Colombia's Caribbean coast to fish in open waters. Days later, he was dead \u2014 one of at least\u00a032 alleged drug traffickers killed in U.S. military strikes.",
      "From Santa Marta, northern Colombia, Carranza's family is questioning White House claims that he was carrying narcotics aboard a small vessel targeted last month.",
      "For his wife Katerine Hernandez, the 40-year-old was \"a good man\" devoted to fishing.",
      "\"Why did they just take his life like that?\" she asked during an interview Monday with AFP.",
      "She denied he had any link to drug trafficking.",
      "\"The fishermen have the right to live. Why didn't they just detain them?\"",
      "The Trump administration\u00a0has said\u00a0the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, arguing that the narcotics they smuggle kill tens of thousands of Americans every year, constituting an \"armed attack.\"",
      "Since the United States began bombing boats in the Caribbean in September, critics have accused the Trump administration of carrying out extrajudicial executions.",
      "The White House and Pentagon have produced little evidence to back up their claims that those targeted were involved in trafficking.",
      "Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, a critic of the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean, has also claimed Carranza was innocent.",
      "Petro said his crew suffered a mechanical failure at sea.",
      "\"The Colombian boat was adrift with a distress signal, its engine raised,\" Petro wrote Saturday on X. \"He had no ties to drug trafficking. His daily activity was fishing.\"",

      "Prosecutors contacted by AFP refused to confirm or deny the reports.",
      "The U.S. government has released statements and images purporting to show strikes on at least seven boats allegedly carrying drugs, leaving at least 32 dead.",
      "\"The days went by and he didn't call\"",
      "Before his last trip, Carranza told his father he was heading to a spot \"with good fish.\"",
      "Days passed without contact, until the family learned of the bombing on television.",
      "\"The days went by and he didn't call,\" Hernandez said.",
      "The deadly strikes have sparked a diplomatic row between the United States and Colombia, historically close partners.",
      "Petro condemned the attack as a violation of Colombian sovereignty and labeled it an \"assassination.\" In a post on X, Petro said the U.S. operation was part of a \"failed strategy\" to \"control Latin America ... and obtain cheap oil from Venezuela.\"",
      "Mr. Trump later\u00a0called Petro\u00a0an \"illegal drug leader\" and threatened to cut off U.S. aid to the South American country.",
      "Last month, Washington announced it had\u00a0decertified Colombia\u00a0as an ally in the fight against drugs. Colombia hit back by halting arms purchases from the United States, its biggest military partner.",

      "\"He went offshore to catch sierra, tuna, and snapper, which are found far out at this time of year,\" said Cesar Henriquez, who has known him since childhood.",
      "\"He always came back to Santa Marta, secured his boat, and went home. I never knew him to do anything bad,\" Henriquez told AFP.",
      "A Colombian and an Ecuadoran are the only survivors so far of U.S. attacks in the Caribbean. A U.S. Navy helicopter transported those survivors of the attack from the semi-submersible to a Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News on Friday.",
      "The Colombian, repatriated in serious condition, will face trial as a \"criminal\" accused of drug trafficking, according to the government.",
      "The Ecuadoran was released after authorities said he had no pending charges. A government official, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, told The Associated Press that the Ecuadorian man, identified as Andr\u00e9s Fernando Tufi\u00f1o, was in good health after medical evaluations."

    "summary": "At least 63 people were killed in an accident involving two buses that hit head-on and two other vehicles on a highway in western Uganda, police say.",
    "story": [
      "Kampala, Uganda \u2014 Two buses and two other vehicles crashed early Wednesday on a highway in western Uganda, killing at least 46 people, police said, in one of the worst motor accidents in the East African country in recent years.",
      "Police initially gave the death toll as 63 in a statement sent to reporters, but later revised it to 46, saying in another statement that some people found unconscious at the crash scene were actually still alive.",
      "\"At the time of the crash, several victims were found unconscious, and some may have been mistakenly included in the initial fatality count,\" the statement said.",
      "The accident happened shortly after midnight local time on the highway from Kampala, the capital, to Gulu, a major city in northern Uganda.",
      "Two bus drivers going in opposite directions tried to pass other vehicles and collided head-on, according to police. Four vehicles were involved in all.",
      "\"One of the (bus) drivers swerved in an attempt to avoid collision, but this resulted in a head-on and side collision, causing a chain reaction that led to other vehicles losing control and overturning several times,\" the statement continued.",
      "\"As investigations continue, we strongly urge all motorists to exercise maximum caution on the roads, especially avoiding dangerous and careless overtaking, which remains one of the leading causes of crashes in the country,\" police said.",
      "Fatal road crashes are common in Uganda, where roads are often narrow. Police usually blame such accidents on speeding drivers.",
      "In August, a bus carrying mourners back home from a funeral in southwestern Kenya overturned and plunged into a ditch, killing at least 25 people and injuring several others.",
      "The death toll in the latest crash in Uganda is uncommonly high, said Irene Nakasiita, a Red Cross spokeswoman who described victims left bleeding and with broken limbs. She said the images from the scene were too gruesome to share.",
      "\"The magnitude of this incident is so big,\" Nakasiita said.",
      "While accident victims can expect to get help from onlookers and other first responders who rush to crash sites, \"at night even bystanders are not there,\" she said.",
      "Most of the injured people are receiving treatment at a government hospital nearby.",
      "In Uganda, 5,144 people were killed in road crashes in 2024. That number rose from 4,806 in 2023 and 4,534 in 2022, according to official police figures, which show a worrisome rise in the total number of those killed or injured in road crashes in recent years.",
      "Careless passing and speeding accounted for 44.5% of all crashes documented in 2024, the police's latest crime report said.",
      "In addition to reckless driving and bad infrastructure, there is poor enforcement of traffic rules, especially for heavy vehicles moving at night, said Joseph Beyanga, a road safety campaigner who for years has been trying to raise awareness about road carnage in Uganda.",
      "He told The Associated Press that the latest crash showed he and others have more work to do. \"These crashes are just a cruel reminder that we still have a long way to go,\" he said. \"On the government side, there is total absence of enforcement. What's happening on the roads is anarchy.\"",
      "Beyanga, campaigning as Joe Walker, organizes regular walks from Kampala into the countryside that are often attended by hundreds of followers.",
      "His next event, planned for next month, will be a walk of more than 37 miles in memory of hundreds of thousands killed or maimed in road crashes over the years, he said."

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner said Tuesday that the U.S.-brokered plan to end the war in Gaza is going better than they expected, despite the violence that erupted between Israel and Hamas in recent days. Vance, Kushner and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff are in Israel this week as they try to\u00a0shore up the fragile ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "\"Look, I think that we are one week into President Trump's historic peace plan in the Middle East, and things are going frankly better than I expected that they were,\" Vance told reporters as he began his press conference in Israel.",
      "Vance insisted this is \"not the end\" of the peace plan, but rather, \"exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other, who have been fighting against each other for a very long time.\"",
      "\"We are doing very well,\" he said. \"We're in a very good place. We're going to have to keep working on it, but I think we have the team to do exactly that.\"",
      "But Vance urged a \"little bit of patience\" as Israel waits for the return of all of the hostages' remains from Hamas. Vance said there are \"difficulties\" in securing all the bodies.",
      "\"Some of these hostages are buried under thousands of pounds of rubble,\" he said. \"Some of the hostages nobody even knows where they are.\"",
      "Two more bodies of hostages were transported back to Israel on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces. They were sent to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine to be identified, the Israeli military said.",
      "The peace process has taken incremental steps forward despite the weekend violence, with Israel returning the remains of 15 Palestinians to Gaza on Tuesday following the handover by Hamas on Monday evening of the body of another deceased hostage. As part of the peace deal, a total of 165 Palestinians' bodies have now been returned to Gaza, many of them former detainees, while all 20 living Israeli hostages have been released by Hamas, along with the confirmed\u00a0remains of 13 other deceased captives.",
      "The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu early Wednesday morning local time identified the remains of one of the returned hostages as Arie Zalmanovich, who was 85 when he died, according to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "The IDF early Wednesday morning also said the remains of one of the returned hostages had been identified as Sgt. Maj. (res.) Tamir Adar, 38. The IDF said he was killed during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack and his body was then taken to Gaza.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Zalmanovich and Adar were the two whose remains were released by Hamas on Tuesday.",
      "But despite those steps, the long-term viability of Mr. Trump's peace plan, which he's said will end nearly eight decades of fighting between Israel and the Palestinians, remains less certain.",
      "\"A lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other, but what we are seeing is that things are going in accordance,\" Kushner said Tuesday. \"Both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture.\"",
      "Kushner appeared optimistic, saying it's \"amazing to think it's only been a week\" since the peace agreement was signed.",
      "Vance said the last week has given him \"great optimism\" the ceasefire is going to hold, adding that he'd come to Israel to \"see how things were going\" on the ground so he could report back to the president.",
      "The U.S. and Israel need to be \"a little bit flexible\" on the issue of Hamas' disarmament, he said.",
      "\"I'm not going to do what the president of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,\" he said of Hamas' time to disarm. \"A lot of this stuff is unpredictable.\"",
      "As he answered reporters' questions, the vice president emphasized that no American troops would be deployed in Gaza to implement the peace plan.",
      "\"There are not going to be American boots on the ground in Gaza,\" Vance said. \"The president of the United States has made that very clear, all of our military leadership has made that very clear. What we can do is provide some useful coordination.\"",
      "Before Vance left for Israel, he said bumps in the road to peace were to be expected.",
      "\"There are going to be fits and starts,\" Vance told reporters. \"Hamas is gonna fire on Israel, Israel's gonna have to respond, of course.\"",
      "Hamas has denied responsibility for an alleged RPG attack that killed two Israeli soldiers over the weekend. Netanyahu said Monday that it was a Hamas attack, and that the Israeli military responded to the alleged ceasefire violation by dropping almost 169 tons of bombs in Gaza.",
      "\"One of our hands holds a weapon, the other hand is stretched out for peace,\" Netanyahu told lawmakers on Monday. \"You make peace with the strong, not the weak. Today Israel is stronger than ever before.\"",
      "The Israeli strikes killed at least 45 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-ruled territory.",
      "President Trump warned Hamas on Monday against breaching the deal that took months to negotiate.",
      "\"They're gonna behave, they're gonna be nice,\" he said. \"And if they're not, we're gonna go and eradicate them if we have to.\"",
      "Kushner and Witkoff met Monday with Netanyahu, and the Israeli leader's office said Vance would also meet him this week. The vice president and second lady Usha Vance were greeted upon their arrival Tuesday by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Yechiel Leiter and Israel's Minister of Justice Yariv Levin.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have a working lunch with Witkoff and Kushner on Tuesday before his meeting with Netanyahu.",
      "Ex-Israeli official casts doubt on prospects for Trump's peace plan",
      "Some Israelis remain skeptical that the Israeli prime minister is genuinely interested in a lasting peace. Among them is fierce Netanyahu critic Alon Pinkas, who served as an advisor to four Israeli foreign ministers.",
      "He told CBS News that Netanyahu signed the peace deal brokered by Mr. Trump, but never really backed its core purpose, or Mr. Trump's stated goal of securing an enduring peace in the heart of the Middle East.",
      "\"This was an agreement he was bullied into,\" Pinkas said. \"This is an agreement he signed under duress, and now he is developing a new scheme to manipulate Trump.\"",
      "Pinkas credited Mr. Trump for doing \"something that his predecessors were disinclined or hesitant to do, and that is exert real pressure\" on Israel's leader.",
      "\"It worked, but it only worked for the first phase,\" Pinkas said, referring to the living Israeli hostages being released and the ceasefire coming into effect.",
      "He said after the weekend's violence that the deal had been \"ostensibly restored, but when Netanyahu says, 'I'm restoring the ceasefire,' it's only because there's a visit here of the vice president, JD Vance, and because the U.S. sent its envoy.\"",
      "Pinkas said he was certain Israeli forces would resume operations in Gaza within days, noting they remained deployed in about half of the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"The hostages are no longer in danger because they were freed, and Hamas was not decisively destroyed, as Mr. Netanyahu promised and boasted and bragged for two years, so I see a serious incentive for Mr. Netanyahu to resume\" an offensive against Hamas, Pinkas told CBS News. \"Maybe not on a huge scale, given the agreement, but I do see ... a local skirmish that becomes a wider flare-up, that then deteriorates or escalates into a full Israeli military operation.\"",
      "Hamas' top negotiator said Tuesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement. But President Trump's peace plan calls for the demilitarization of Gaza, and many analysts, including Pinkas, have doubts that Hamas will willingly hand over all its weapons.",
      "\"That's probably the biggest flaw in the agreement,\" said Pinkas. \"The agreement in and of itself is a good agreement, but in order for an agreement like that to work, it requires good faith, good will, and trust. None of these ingredients exist. In fact, both sides have a vested interest in not progressing beyond the ceasefire.\"",
      "\"Hamas wants to lure Israel inside [Gaza] into a de-facto occupation, and mount an insurgency and show to the Palestinians that they are the real resistance. And Netanyahu wants to go in because he knows that if everything stops now and there is progress into the next phases, that almost inevitably means that he will be deemed as the guy who failed to defeat Hamas.\"",
      "Pinkas said that while the past two years of war have left Hamas defeated militarily and degraded, \"Hamas is not done. Hamas are there, and you see those pictures every day. You show them on CBS \u2014   Hamas gangs walking around in battle fatigues, armed. That's not going to cut it politically for Mr. Netanyahu.\"",
      "Speaking in a recent interview with CBS News' Tony Dokoupil, Netanyahu said his government had agreed \"to give peace a chance,\" but he noted that the conditions of Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "\"We also agreed: Okay, let's get the first part done. Now let's give a chance to do the second part peacefully, which is my hope,\" the Israeli leader told CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0French authorities may well manage to track down and arrest the thieves who pulled off an audacious robbery of royal crown jewels from Paris' iconic Louvre museum, but they're unlikely to recover the national treasures, a criminologist told CBS News on Tuesday. The heist took place on Sunday, in broad daylight with tourists in the museum, but nobody was hurt.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News.",
      "But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "See the jewels the Louvre thieves got away with \u2014 and one they didn't",
      "See the jewels the Louvre thieves got away with \u2014 and one they didn't",
      "Bauer said a lot of DNA was left at the scene by the robbers, including on the crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was left behind by the thieves as they made their getaway on motorcycles.",
      "French police also recovered a large crane lift used by the thieves to access an upper floor window of the 230-year-old museum, along with a power saw, gloves, a walkie-talkie and a can of gasoline. Authorities have said the criminals may have intended to use the gas to burn their tools, but they ran out of time.",
      "The criminals entered from the back side of the Louvre's main building on Sunday \u2014 away from the main entrance with its famous glass pyramid \u2014 before cutting their way through a window using the power lift and saw. They then made their way straight for the Galerie d'Apollon, the large hall that housed the crown jewels.",
      "If the thieves were professional criminals, they may well be known to the police, with information available on French law enforcement databases, Bauer told CBS News.",
      "But \"if they're amateur, or in the middle, under control or subcontracted by somebody else, it may be a little more complicated,\" he said.",
      "What are the jewels stolen from the Louvre worth?",
      "The stolen French crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said Tuesday their estimated worth is 88 million euros, or $102 million.",
      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" Beccuau said in an interview with French broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Experts have told CBS News the jewels would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "One of the stolen items is a tiara featuring 212 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds, commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III to celebrate his marriage to Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo in 1853. Also swiped: a sapphire-and-diamond tiara and necklace set, a large diamond brooch, and an emerald necklace and earrings that were originally a wedding gift from Napoleon to his second wife, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria, in 1810.",
      "The stunning theft was the most spectacular robbery at the Louvre museum since the Mona Lisa was stolen in 1911. The iconic painting by Leonardo da Vinci was located in Italy and returned to the Louvre several years later.",
      "Sunday's heist has been described as both a tragedy and a national embarrassment for France.",
      "\"You know, you think, in the Louvre, of all places, don't they have the best security on the planet?\" one stunned American tourist told the French news agency AFP soon after the robbery, calling it \"crazy.\"",
      "But security experts say the Louvre's security vulnerabilities were extensive. A recent security audit noted that 35% of the rooms in the Denon Wing, where the jewels were kept, have no security cameras, according to a Radio France report.",
      "France's Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin told reporters on Monday that the country had fundamentally failed to secure its national treasures.",
      "\"I know that we cannot secure totally all the sites. But what was sure was that we failed, because someone was capable of putting in a crane truck, in the open, in the streets of Paris, to have people walk up for a couple of minutes and take priceless jewels and give France a deplorable image,\" Darmanin lamented."

      "In her posthumously published memoir, Virginia Roberts Giuffre shares a personal account of the story that made headlines worldwide: her accusations against Prince Andrew and years of alleged trafficking by Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice\" was released on Tuesday. Guiffre died by suicide earlier this year.",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the book:",
      "More details about Prince Andrew",
      "Giuffre's book alleges that she had sex with Prince Andrew three times, including when she was 17, after being trafficked by Epstein. One time, she said, was part of an orgy involving around eight other girls.",
      "\"The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of eighteen and didn't really speak English,\" Giuffre said.",
      "She said that, as her legal case progressed, Andrew made it difficult for her legal team to serve him papers by \"fleeing to Queen Elizabeth's Balmoral Castle in Scotland and hiding behind its well-guarded gates.\" Andrew denied her allegations.",
      "But a turning point came with Andrew's November 2019 interview on the BBC program Newsnight. He was widely criticized for seeming to lack empathy when asked about the accusations, and Giuffre says the interview \"was like an injection of jet fuel\" for her legal team.",
      "\"Its contents would not only help us build an ironclad case against the prince but also open the door to potentially subpoenaing his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, and their daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "She said her settlement negotiations with Andrew began to move quickly after he hired American lawyer Andrew Brettler, who had worked with other public figures facing #MeToo allegations.",
      "Brettler \"was less reluctant than some of his British counterparts to face reality,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "Giuffre said she and her team were asking for more than money as part of the settlement: They wanted an acknowledgement of what Giuffre had been through.",
      "\"After casting doubt on my credibility for so long \u2014 Prince Andrew's team had even gone so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me \u2014 the Duke of York owed me a meaningful apology as well. We would never get a confession, of course.\"",
      "The settlement was announced on Feb. 15, 2022, and Prince Andrew and Giuffre issued a joint statement which made clear he would pay Giuffre money, but didn't specify the amount. It also said he would make a \"substantial donation\" in support of victims' rights to Giuffre's nonprofit organization. Andrew did not admit wrongdoing but said in court documents that he \"regrets his association with Epstein.\"",
      "\"I agreed to a one-year gag order, which seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished any more than it already had been,\" Giuffre wrote.",
      "Last week, ahead of the publication of Giuffre's memoir, Prince Andrew announced he would no longer use his Duke of York title, after already having stepped back from royal duties in 2019.",
      "Mar-a-Lago and a meeting with Trump",
      "Before she first encountered Gislaine Maxwell and was brought into Epstein's world, in 2000, Giuffre worked at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, alongside her father, who was a maintenance man responsible for the air conditioning units in hotel rooms, as well as the clay tennis courts.",
      "\"I remember he gave me a brief tour before presenting me to the hiring manager who \u2014 after I passed both a drug test and a polygraph \u2014 agreed to take me on,\" Giuffre wrote. She said she met Mr. Trump a few days after starting work at the resort.",
      "\"They weren't friends exactly. But Dad worked hard, and Trump liked that,\" Giuffre said.",
      "When she met Mr. Trump in his office, she said he \"couldn't have been friendlier, telling me it was fantastic I was there.\"",
      "He also asked if she babysat, Guiffre wrote, mentioning families with children who stayed in his properties nearby.",
      "But it was also at Mar-a-Lago that Giuffre said she first met Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "\"One steaming hot day some weeks before my seventeenth birthday, I was walking toward the Mar-a-Lago spa, on my way to work, when a car slowed behind me. I wish I could say that I sensed that something evil was tracking me, but as I headed into the building, I had no inkling of the danger I was in,\" Giuffre said.",
      "Maxwell jumped out of the car and introduced herself to Giuffre.",
      "\"I wish I could say that I saw through Maxwell's polished facade \u2014 that, like a horse, I intuited the immense threat she posed to me. Instead, my first impression of Maxwell was the same one I formed when I greeted any well-heeled Mar-a-Lago guest. I'd be lucky, I thought, if I could grow up to be anything like her.\"",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 on federal charges including sex trafficking conspiracy, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Epstein died in jail in 2019 after his arrest on sex trafficking charges.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied knowledge of Epstein and Maxwell's activities.",
      "Giuffre's message to the world",
      "Giuffre writes about how the abuse she was subjected to affected her and how she dedicated herself to standing up those who harmed her and supporting others to do the same.",
      "\"Don't be fooled by those in Epstein's circle who say they didn't know what Epstein was doing,\" Guiffre said at the end of the book. \"Anyone who spent any significant amount of time with Epstein saw him touching girls in ways you wouldn't want a creepy old man touching your daughter. They can say they didn't know he was raping children. But they were not blind. (Not to mention the fact that many prominent people were still associating with him years after).\"",
      "Though it was difficult, Guiffre said she was glad she had worked to share her story.",
      "\"I don't regret it, but the constant telling and retelling has been extremely painful and exhausting,\" she said.",
      "Guiffre leaves readers with this message:",
      "\"I hope my story has moved you \u2014 to seek ways to free yourself from a bad situation, say, to stand up for someone else in need, or to simply reframe how you judge victims of sexual abuse. Each one of us can make positive change. I truly believe that. I hope for a world in which predators are punished, not protected; victims are treated with compassion, not shamed; and powerful people face the same consequences as anyone else. I yearn, too, for a world in which perpetrators face more shame than their victims do and where anyone who's been trafficked can confront their abusers when they are ready, no matter how much time has passed. We don't live in this world yet. \u2026 If this book moves us even an inch closer to a reality like that \u2014 if it helps just one person \u2014 I will have achieved my goal.\""

      "Crown jewels that were stolen in a dramatic weekend heist\u00a0at the Louvre are worth an estimated 88 million euros, or $102 million, not including their historical value to France, the Paris prosecutor said Tuesday.",
      "About 100 investigators are now involved in the police hunt for the gems and heist suspects, said prosecutor Laure Beccuau, whose office is leading the investigation.",
      "\"The wrongdoers who took these gems won't earn 88 million euros if they had the very bad idea of disassembling these jewels,\" she said in an interview with broadcaster RTL. \"We can perhaps hope that they'll think about this and won't destroy these jewels without rhyme or reason.\"",
      "Questions have arisen about security at the Louvre, the world's most-visited museum, and whether security cameras might have failed as the thieves rode a basket lift up the Louvre's facade, cut their way through a window, smashed display cases and fled with priceless Napoleonic jewels on Sunday morning.",
      "But France's culture minister said Tuesday that the security apparatus installed at the Louvre worked properly during the theft.",
      "\"The Louvre museum's security apparatus did not fail, that is a fact,\" the minister, Rachida Dati, told lawmakers in the National Assembly. \"The Louvre museum's security apparatus worked.\"",
      "Dati said she launched an administrative inquiry that comes in addition to a police investigation to ensure full transparency into what happened. She did not offer any details about how the thieves managed to carry out their heist given that the cameras were working. But she described it as a painful blow for the nation.",
      "The robbery was \"a wound for all of us,\" she said. \"Why? Because the Louvre is far more than the world's largest museum. It's a showcase for our French culture and our shared patrimony.\"",
      "Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez said Monday that the museum's alarm was triggered when the window of the Apollo Gallery was broken into.",
      "Police officers arrived on site two or three minutes after they were called by an individual that witnessed the scene, he said on LCI television. Officials said the heist lasted less than eight minutes in total, including less than four minutes inside the Louvre.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez did not disclose details about video surveillance cameras that may have filmed the thieves around and in the museum, pending a police investigation. \"There are cameras all around the Louvre,\" he said.",
      "The theft focused on the gilded Apollo Gallery, where the Crown Diamonds are displayed. Eight objects were taken, according to officials: a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense; an emerald necklace and earrings from the matching set of Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte's second wife; a reliquary brooch; and Empress Eug\u00e9nie's diadem and her large corsage-bow brooch, a prized 19th-century imperial ensemble.",
      "Alain Bauer, a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts, told CBS News that a lot of DNA was left at the scene by the robbers, including on the crown of the empress Eug\u00e9nie, which was left behind by the thieves as they made their getaway on motorcycles.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" he said of the thieves. But he added: \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The crown jewels are priceless in historical terms, but experts have told CBS News they would still be worth millions of dollars if broken up and sold on the black market.",
      "The jewels were not privately insured, the French Ministry of Culture said in a statement to the daily newspaper Le Parisien. French law prohibits entities like the Louvre from insuring its property, except when part of a collection is moved or loaned to another institution, Romain D\u00e9chelette, president of France-based Serex Assurances, a fine art insurer, told CBS News."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Oct 2025 13:56:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The brazen daylight robbery at the Louvre in Paris is reminding some of a notorious gang of European thieves.",
    "story": [
      "The thieves who stole priceless jewelry from the Louvre are reviving memories of an audacious gang that stole $500 million in valuables in a series of daring heists that took place over nearly two decades.",
      "The Pink Panthers targeted jewelry stores and museums in Europe and Asia and carried out some of the largest heists in history, raking in half a billion dollars worth of stolen goods between the early 1990s and mid-2010s.",
      "There is no evidence that the theft at the Louvre is connected to the Pink Panthers, but the brazen nature of the robbery was similar to those carried out by the gang.",
      "Who are the Pink Panthers?",
      "The Pink Panthers are a network of loosely organized teams, Interpol secretary general Ron Noble told \"60 Minutes\" in 2014. There are hundreds of gang members associated with the group. Most were from Eastern Europe, Noble said, and many fought in the Serbian Special Forces during the Bosnian Wars in the mid-1990s. The gang has no organized chain of command, Noble said, and uses experts in fields like safecracking, carjacking and more.",
      "The Pink Panthers bring military discipline and expert planning to their thefts, Noble said, often doing weeks of surveillance and preparation before hitting their target. The attacks are carried out by small teams, typically in under a minute, and have well-planned getaways, Noble said. Once on the run, the gang quickly crosses international borders, often using fake passports.",
      "One audacious robbery saw the Pink Panthers drive cars into a mall in Dubai before smashing into a jewelry store, stealing handfuls of diamonds and driving out \u2014 all in 45 seconds. They are responsible for the largest art robbery in Japanese history and the biggest jewel heist in Britain. In the latter incident, the thieves made off with $40 million of precious stones, including some hidden in a jar of cold cream. In San-Tropez, France, they escaped by speedboat after stealing $3 million worth of jewelry. In 2008, the Pink Panthers stole priceless paintings from an art museum in Zurich, Switzerland. The artworks were worth a combined $163 million, making it the largest art robbery in European history.",
      "Law enforcement has been chasing the gang for years, Noble said. Interpol has identified 800 members of the Pink Panthers using photos, fingerprints and DNA, Noble said. Several gang members have been taken into custody, including one arrest in 2024. Some of their stolen goods \u2014 including the paintings taken from Zurich \u2014 have been recovered. However, diamonds and jewelry are difficult to recover, since the gems can be recut or turned into different pieces.",
      "Robbery at the Louvre",
      "The thieves at the Louvre worked in broad daylight while tourists were already inside the famed museum. The thieves entered the museum with a crane-like lift, then smashed glass cases in the Apollon Gallery, home of the French crown jewels. They fled the scene on motorcycles, a museum spokesperson said.",
      "The museum was closed after the brazen heist, and no injuries were reported. French officials said the robbery was carried out in just four minutes, and referred to the thieves as \"professionals.\" Criminologist Alain Bauer told CBS News that the thieves left behind DNA, which could be matched to information in law enforcement databases if the robbers are known to police. French police said supplies including a power saw, gloves, a walkie-talkie and a can of gasoline were also found. Bauer said the evidence will help police with their investigation.",
      "\"We will catch them,\" said Bauer, who is a professor of criminology at France's National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts. \"I don't think we will capture the jewels.\"",
      "The thieves took nine pieces from the jewelry collection of Napoleon III. One item \u2014 the crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, made of gold, emerald and diamonds \u2014 was found apparently dropped outside the museum.",
      "The other pieces stolen include a pearl and diamond tiara with over 200 pearls and nearly 2,000 diamonds, a gold corsage bow-shaped brooch with thousands of stones, a set of sapphire jewelry that may have once belonged to Marie Antoinette, an emerald necklace and pair of earrings that Napoleon gave his second wife as a wedding gift, and a diamond-encrusted brooch.",
      "The jewels were of \"inestimable value,\" according to France's interior minister and the museum. Despite their value, the jewels were apparently not in reinforced cases, art historian and former Louvre worker David Chanteranne told CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer. For purposes of \"historical accuracy,\" the jewels were presented in their original cases.",
      "Recent thefts across Europe",
      "There have been other notable heists at European museums in recent years. Thieves in Germany smashed into Dresden's Green Vault museum overnight in 2019 and stole over $120 million worth of jewels. The robbers said in court that they used an axe to smash the cases and a fire extinguisher to hide their DNA. Some of the pieces they stole were recovered, but were damaged. Others have never been found.",
      "Thousands of items were discovered to have been stolen from the British Museum in 2023. The small pieces were not on display and were largely used for research purposes. An employee was fired and the museum said they were seeking legal action against them. Some of the items have been recovered.",
      "In 2022, a group of men broke into Germany's Celtic and Roman Museum, in a heist that took place in just nine minutes. Cables were cut at a nearby telecommunications hub, leaving the area without communications networks. The thieves pried open the museum's door, then smashed into a display case to take hundreds of gold coins that dated back to 100 B.C. They left the museum without triggering any alarms.",
      "The men were arrested several months later. Three participants were convicted and handed prison sentences that ranged up to 11 years, while a fourth was acquitted of involvement in the theft but convicted on other charges. The treasure is still missing and appeared to have been at least partially melted down.",
      "In 2020, a Van Gogh painting was stolen from a Dutch museum that was closed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The painting was recovered in 2023, according to the Smithsonian."

      "The Michoacan state prosecutor's office said on social media\u00a0Monday that the body of Bernardo Bravo, president of the Apatzingan Valley Citrus Producers Association, was found in his vehicle on a road in the area.",
      "In several interviews with Mexico's Radio Formula in late September and earlier this month, Bravo denounced \"organized crime's permanent commercial hijacking of any commercial activity.\" He said criminals' demands had become out of reach for producers who were left with no other choice but to negotiate with them.",
      "He conceded that the federal government had made some advances against organized crime in the area, but said more had to be done to end their impunity.",
      "Last year, the federal government sent hundreds of troops to Michoacan to protect lime growers complaining of extortion threats.",
      "In August, more than half of lime packing warehouses in the lowlands of Michoacan closed temporarily after growers and distributors said they had received demands from the Los Viagras and other cartels for a cut of their income.",
      "Limes have been a revenue stream for cartels for years in Mexico.",
      "In 2013, lime growers founded and led Mexico's biggest vigilante movement. Cartels at the time had taken control of distribution, manipulating domestic prices for crops like avocados and limes, telling growers when they could harvest and at what price they could sell their crops.",
      "Mexican gangs and other illegal actors have also targeted\u00a0avocado production.",
      "Cartel extortion in Mexico",
      "Of the various criminal groups operating in Michoacan, several were declared foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration, including United Cartels, the New Michoacan Family and the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "Cartels in many parts of Mexico have expanded into kidnapping and\u00a0extortion\u00a0to increase their income, demanding money from residents and business owners and threatening to kidnap or kill them if they refuse.",
      "In July, Mexico's government said it dismantled\u00a0a criminal group behind a massive extortion scheme. The gang, with ties to a major drug cartel, had operated out of the central State of Mexico, extorting companies and individuals in 14 municipalities and controlling labor unions in the construction, mining, agriculture and parcel delivery industries.",
      "In July 2024, a fisheries industry leader who complained of drug cartel extortion and illegal fishing was\u00a0shot to death\u00a0in the northern border state of Baja California. Minerva P\u00e9rez was killed just hours after she complained of widespread competition from illegal fishing.",
      "Ordinary citizens are also targeted with extortion. In January 2024, a cartel in Michoacan set up its own makeshift internet antennas and told locals they had to pay to use its Wi-Fi service or they would be killed, prosecutors said. Dubbed\u00a0\"narco-antennas\"\u00a0by local media, the cartel's system involved internet antennas set up in various towns built with stolen equipment."

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 France's former president Nicolas Sarkozy became the first previous head of a European Union state to be jailed on Tuesday, proclaiming his innocence as he entered a Paris prison. France's right-wing leader from 2007 to 2012, Sarkozy was found guilty last month of seeking to acquire funding from Muammmar Qaddafi's Libya for the campaign that saw him elected.",
      "Agence France-Presse journalists saw the 70-year-old \u2014   who has appealed the verdict \u2014 leave his home, and after a short drive flanked by police on motorbikes, enter the La Sante prison in the French capital.",
      "The reporters heard convicts shouting \"Welcome Sarkozy!\" and \"Sarkozy's here\" from their cells.",
      "In a defiant message posted on social media as he was being transferred, Sarkozy again denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"It is not a former president of the republic being jailed this morning, but an innocent man,\" he said in the post. \"I have no doubt. The truth will prevail.\"",
      "Sarkozy was handed a five-year jail term in September for criminal conspiracy over a plan for late Libyan dictator Qaddafi to fund his electoral campaign. Qaddafi was killed in 2011 \u2014 the first leader killed amid the \"Arab Spring\" uprisings that rocked the Middle East as a number of countries with long-time dictatorial regimes faced popular revolts.",
      "After his Sept. 25 verdict, Sarkozy had said he would \"sleep in prison \u2014   but with my head held high.\"",
      "Dozens of supporters and family members had stood outside the former president's home from early Tuesday, some holding up framed portraits of him.",

      "Sarkozy's lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request had been immediately filed for Sarkozy's release.",
      "The Paris appeals court in theory has two months to decide whether to free him pending an appeals trial, but the delay is usually shorter.",
      "\"He will be inside for at least three weeks to a month,\" Ingrain said.",
      "Sarkozy is the first French leader to be incarcerated since Philippe Petain, the Nazi collaborationist head of state who was jailed after World War II.",
      "Sarkozy told Le Figaro newspaper he will be taking with him a biography of Jesus and a copy of \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" a novel in which an innocent man is sentenced to jail but escapes to take revenge.",
      "Sarkozy facing likely solitary confinement",
      "Sarkozy is likely to be held in a 95 square foot cell in the prison's solitary confinement wing to avoid contact with other prisoners, prison staff told AFP.",
      "In solitary confinement, prisoners are allowed out of their cells for one walk a day, alone, in a small yard. Sarkozy will also be allowed visits three times a week.",
      "The former French presidents multiple legal woes",
      "Sarkozy has faced a flurry of legal woes since losing his reelection bid in 2012.",
      "He has also been convicted in two other cases.",
      "In one, he served a sentence for graft \u2014   over seeking to secure favors from a judge \u2014   under house arrest while wearing an electronic ankle tag, which was removed after several months in May.",
      "In another, France's top court is to rule next month in a case in which he is accused of illegal campaign financing in 2012.",
      "In the so-called \"Libyan case,\" prosecutors said his aides, acting in Sarkozy's name, struck a deal with Qaddafi in 2005 to illegally fund his victorious presidential election bid two years later.",
      "Investigators believe that in return, Qaddafi was promised help to restore his international image after Tripoli was blamed for the 1988 bombing of a passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, and another over Niger in 1989, killing hundreds of passengers.",
      "The court convicted him of criminal conspiracy over the plan, but it did not conclude that Sarkozy received or used the funds for his campaign.",
      "It acquitted him on charges of embezzling Libyan public funds, passive corruption and illicit financing of an electoral campaign.",
      "Sarkozy had already been stripped of France's highest distinction, his Legion of Honor, following the earlier graft conviction.",
      "Six out of 10 people in France believe the prison sentence to be \"fair,\" according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults conducted by pollster Elabe. But Sarkozy still enjoys support on the French right and has on occasion had private meetings with President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Macron welcomed Sarkozy to the Elysee Palace on Friday, telling the press this week: \"It was normal, on a human level, for me to receive one of my predecessors in this context.\""

    "story": [
      "Royal author Andrew Lownie has written an explosive new book titled \"Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York.\"",
      "Prince Andrew's daughters Princess Beatrice of York and Princess Eugenie of York are facing the fallout from their father's scandals, according to experts.",
      "Last Friday, Andrew, 65, announced that he was giving up his royal title of the Duke of York and other honors following renewed public scrutiny of his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and explosive new allegations made by the prince's late accuser Virginia Giuffre in her posthumous memoir, \"Nobody\u2019s Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice.\"",
      "Andrew is also being investigated by London's Metropolitan Police due to newly leaked emails that show the royal allegedly asked his personal protection officer to seek out potentially damaging information about Giuffre.",
      "PRINCE ANDREW GIVES UP ROYAL TITLE WITH KING CHARLES' SUPPORT",
      "Meanwhile, Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, with whom he shares Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, has been embroiled in controversies of her own after a leaked email emerged in which she praised Epstein after publicly denouncing their friendship, leading several U.K. charities to sever ties with her.",
      "Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital that Beatrice and Eugenie should increasingly try to define themselves outside the scandals, which have created reputational risk and public scrutiny issues for them.",
      "Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie are facing the fallout of their father's scandals.\u00a0 (Samir Hussein/WireImage; Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images;\u00a0)",
      "\"The challenge for Beatrice and Eugenie in this close-knit family is to carve separate roles from their disgraced parents,\" he said. \"They are well-adjusted and have careers as well as doing charitable work. However, the York's brand is truly toxic.\"",
      "Fitzwilliams also pointed out that the \"scandal is likely to worsen\" with the publication of Giuffre's memoir, which was released Tuesday.",
      "\"This will not be easy!\" Fitzwilliams added.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta noted that Beatrice and Eugenie are viewed by many in a sympathetic light as they have been impacted solely by association through no fault of their own.",
      "\"Beatrice and Eugenie are being described by friends as \u2018innocent victims\u2019 and \u2018collateral damage\u2019 in their father\u2019s ongoing fallout,\" Matta said. \"But they are aware enough of the weight of the scandal to lie low for now.\"",
      "\"They even skipped the British Museum Pink Ball this weekend in connection with their father\u2019s controversies,\" she continued. \"Their father\u2019s own distancing from royal duties and titles affects perceptions of the entire family. That can influence how charities, brands, or public institutions want to engage Beatrice and Eugenie, even if they themselves have behaved impeccably.\"",
      "\"They do support their father, and have never wavered from that,\" she added. \"Sources suggest Andrew has become increasingly dependent on his daughters for emotional support amid his reputational decline. That dynamic must be placing additional pressure on Beatrice and Eugenie in both their personal and professional lives.\"",
      "Beatrice and Eugenie have been described as \"collateral damage\" in their father's controversies.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "As Beatrice and Eugenie are not working royals, they both have pursued independent professional careers in the private sector outside the core duties of the monarchy.",
      "Beatrice is currently a vice president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, a U.S.\u2013based artificial intelligence (AI) company that specializes in optimizing customer interactions.",
      "She is married to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 41, a property developer and CEO of the real-estate firm Banda Property. He is also a count and a descendant of an Italian noble family. The couple share daughter Sienna Elizabeth, 4, and Beatrice is stepmother to Mozzi's son from a previous relationship, Christopher \"Wolfie\" Wolffe, 9.",
      "Eugenie is a director at Hauser & Wirth, an international contemporary art gallery in London. She is also co-founder of the Anti-Slavery Collective, a charity that works to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.",
      "In 2018, Eugenie married British businessman and brand ambassador James Brooksbank, 39, with whom she shares sons August Philip Hawke, 4, and Ernest George Ronnie, 2.",
      "Beatrice and Eugenie's children do not have royal titles and use their fathers' surnames, reflecting their parents' wishes to raise them largely outside formal royal life.",
      "Beatrice is pictured with her husband, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.\u00a0 (David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Dom Perignon)",
      "Though they are not working royals, both sisters were born princesses as the daughters of Andrew and the granddaughters of the late Queen Elizabeth II and hold the style \"Her Royal Highness\" by right of birth. Though Andrew and Sarah have lost their titles as the Duke and Duchess of York, Fox News Digital understands that Beatrice and Eugenie's titles will be wholly unaffected.",
      "Matta told Fox News Digital that Beatrice and Eugenie, as well as their parents, would not be excluded from royal family events despite the controversies.",
      "\"We likely will still see the former Yorks and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie at royal family events in the future, but in a more private capacity,\" she said. \"With Sarah\u2019s title no longer in use, though, her visibility at big royal events is unlikely \u2014 as is Andrew\u2019s. I don\u2019t foresee the pair doing the Christmas morning walk, for example, though they\u2019ll likely still be invited to family functions behind closed doors.\"",
      "\"The sisters are a different story, as their titles remain intact and their attendance at select royal functions has no reason to be in doubt,\" the royal expert added. \"They might still even greet the public during walkabouts for high-visibility occasions, family milestones, or key patronage events.\"",
      "\"Beatrice and Eugenie will likely always retain their \u2018Princess\u2019 status by birth, but their formal duties and proximity to the Crown could fade away in the future,\" she added. \"Essentially, in this case, they would move further from the \u2018working royal\u2019 sphere. But there\u2019s just no way to know for sure how they\u2019ll be affected, despite hopeful chatter that Prince William may tap them for official duties in the future.\"",
      "Princess Eugenie married her husband Jack Brooksbank in 2018.\u00a0 (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)",
      "Eugenie and Beatrice are known to have friendly relationships with their cousin Prince William, who is heir to the throne, and his wife Kate Middleton, both 43. Matta noted that the alliance between the sisters and William appears to have become stronger in recent years.",
      "\"There have been some signs of a more focused alignment between William and his cousins, particularly Eugenie who reportedly shares his environmental interests,\" she said. \"They can be seen engaging warmly with the Waleses at official events, and even stepping in to represent the institution at garden parties. That said, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be working in the same \u2018front-line\u2019 capacity as Will and Kate anytime soon.\"",
      "\"If Beatrice and Eugenie do aspire to take on larger royal roles or even maintain their current patronages, they will have to navigate the fallout from Andrew\u2019s scandals more proactively going forward,\" she explained. \"I imagine they are going back to the drawing board on public life, choosing engagements carefully, strengthening their personal brands, and demonstrating their independence from their parents.\"",
      "The sisters share a friendly relationship with William and Kate.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Royal photographer Ian Pelham Turner noted that Beatrice and Eugenie are still viewed positively by the public and supported the royal family through King Charles III and Middleton's battles with cancer over the past two years.",
      "\"Most commentators feel sorry for Beatrice and Eugene for they are two very well-behaved young ladies who really stepped in to engage with royal duties during Charles and Kate\u2019s illnesses and convalescence,\" Turner said. \"They are both exemplary examples of how modern-day royals should behave in this day and age.\"",
      "\"Thus, we have been informed that there will be no retribution towards them and apparently will still be invited for Christmas at Sandringham,\" he added.",
      "Though Beatrice and Eugenie will not be entirely unaffected by their parents' scandals, royal experts have painted a bleaker picture for Andrew and Sarah.",
      "Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal title last Friday.\u00a0 (Steve Parsons/Getty Images)",
      "In her bombshell book, Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year \u2014 recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17.",
      "She accused the prince of treating her as a \"birthright,\" described being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she \"believed that I might die a sex slave.\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW'S IMAGE REMAINS A DANGER TO MONARCHY'S IMAGE AMID REPORTS OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE EVICTION: ROYAL EXPERT",
      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent.\"",
      "Charles has not taken the step of stripping Andrew's titles.\u00a0 (Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)",
      "Andrew, who had already stepped down from his official royal duties following a disastrous 2019 BBC interview about his Epstein connection and Giuffre's allegations, released a statement last Friday in which he announced that he had relinquished his royal title.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" a statement released by the royal, and obtained by Fox News Digital, read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first. I stand by my decision five years ago to stand back from public life.\"",
      "\"With His Majesty\u2019s agreement, we feel I must now go a step further,\" the statement continued. \"I will therefore no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me. As I have said previously, I vigorously deny the accusations against me.\"",
      "However, royal commentators said that the move might not be enough amid the public outrage and the damage that Andrew's controversies have inflicted on the royal family.",
      "Turner noted \"every day more insinuations are emerging about Andrew\u2019s character\" and politicians are calling for him to be stripped of all titles.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, Matta weighed in on whether Charles was likely to take that step.",
      "\"In the end, I think it\u2019s important to remember this is being framed as \u2018voluntary,\u2019 and none of Andrew\u2019s titles have actually been removed, as that would require immense government involvement,\" she pointed out.",
      "\"Even titles one doesn\u2019t \u2018use\u2019 have cultural weight in the UK royal context. \u2018Stripping\u2019 them would send a crystal clear message about status, trust, and belonging \u2014 the acknowledgment that someone is no longer part of the inner institutional circle. That hasn\u2019t happened, and in his Friday statement, Andrew still spoke of duty, family, and support for his brother, the King.\"",

      "In the bombshell book, Giuffre \u2014 who died by suicide at the age of 41 earlier this year \u2014 recalled the multiple sexual encounters she allegedly had with the disgraced royal when she was just 17.",
      "She accused the prince of treating her as a \"birthright,\" described being trafficked for sex by Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and recounted an alleged group sex encounter and how she \"believed that I might die a sex slave.\"",
      "PRINCE ANDREW GIVES UP ROYAL TITLE WITH KING CHARLES' SUPPORT",
      "In addition to her explosive allegations, Giuffre made scathing remarks about Andrew's disastrous 2019 BBC \"Newsnight\" interview, reviving the conversation around the TV appearance that triggered the downfall of his public life.",
      "\"He said he had no recollection of ever meeting me\u2014\u2018None whatsoever.\u2019 Most outlandishly, he said he couldn\u2019t have danced sweatily with me at the Tramp nightclub, as I\u2019d described, because he\u2019d temporarily developed an inability to perspire after enduring \u2018an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War,'\u2014a bizarre reference to his military service nineteen years prior to our meeting,\" she wrote in a copy of the book, obtained by Fox News Digital.",

      "Andrew's interview centered on his friendship with convicted sex-offender Epstein and Giuffre's allegations that he had sex with her when she was underage. The royal agreed to the interview in order to clear his name and explain his relationship with Epstein.",
      "Instead, the interview became infamous due to Andrew\u2019s defensive and tone-deaf answers. After it aired on Nov. 16, 2019, the response was overwhelmingly negative.",
      "The interview was branded a \"car crash\" and a PR disaster, with widespread disbelief at Andrew\u2019s explanations and criticism of his lack of empathy along with other odd moments, including the references to not sweating.",
      "Media, politicians and the public widely viewed it as catastrophic for both his personal reputation and the monarchy\u2019s image. Within days, Buckingham Palace announced that Andrew would step back from public duties \"for the foreseeable future.\" He later lost his military titles and royal patronages, and corporate sponsors and charities cut ties with him and his initiatives.",
      "Meanwhile, Giuffre wrote, \"as devastating as this interview was for Prince Andrew, for my legal team it was like an injection of jet fuel.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, detailed her alleged sexual encounters with Andrew in her posthumous memoir.\u00a0 (Steve Parsons/Getty Images)",
      "In 2021, Giuffre filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who has consistently denied her allegations. In her memoir, she recounted his alleged attempts to discredit and intimidate her as well as reinforce his statements that they had never met. Giuffre wrote that the royal's team \"went so far as to try to hire internet trolls to hassle me\" and claimed his protection officers attempted to \"dig up dirt\" on her.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, royal expert Hilary Fordwich weighed in on the fallout from the book.",
      "PRINCE ANDREW'S IMAGE REMAINS A DANGER TO MONARCHY'S IMAGE AMID REPORTS OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE EVICTION: ROYAL EXPERT",
      "\"In addition to all we know, [Andrew] comes across even worse as unrepentant and manipulative. This is ghastly for the royal family,\" she said.",
      "\"The orgy with eight others is revolting,\" Fordwich continued. \"Her quote that he was having sex with her if having sex with me was his birthright is damning and all the cover-up attempts, which demonstrate deliberate actions and contradict his Newsnight interview where he stated he didn\u2019t even know Giuffre. If he didn\u2019t know her, then why was he trying to cover up?\"",
      "On Oct. 19, The Mail on Sunday published leaked emails suggesting Andrew passed Giuffre\u2019s date of birth and her Social Security number to his personal protection officer with instructions to investigate if she had a criminal record in the U.S. \u2014 a step that could be part of a smear-campaign strategy.",
      "The leaked emails were reportedly sent hours before the 2011 release of a now-infamous photo showing Andrew with an underage Giuffre. In a statement, London's Metropolitan Police told the Guardian, \"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made.\"",
      "Sources also told the BBC that the recent claims about Andrew are being treated by Buckingham Palace with \"very great concern and should be examined in the appropriate ways to the fullest extent.\"",
      "Andrew allegedly appears in this photograph with his arm around the waist of then-17-year-old Giuffre. Ghislaine Maxwell is standing to the right. (U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals)",
      "Fordwich noted that, \"Andrew\u2019s team attempting to hire online trolls in order to harass her so as to cast doubt regarding her credibility during her U.S. lawsuit in a smear campaign, which is now being investigated by British police is also horrendous. It indicates such hubris, moral blindness and entitlement.\"",
      "Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams explained that Giuffre's depiction of Andrew in the memoir and her revival of his 2019 interview could deepen the lasting damage to his reputation and future within the royal family.",
      "\"The portrait she paints of Andrew is of a bovine, entitled and supercilious individual, in some ways never out of the nursery,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"If his Newsnight interview did not exist, no one would have been able to invent it outside a spoof,\" Fitzwilliams continued. \"Yet he was a brave pilot before he succumbed to the lure of disastrous friendships like that of the deceased pedophile Epstein.\"",
      "In August 2019, four months before Andrew's interview, Epstein died in prison while facing federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "After a U.S. judge rejected Andrew's bid to dismiss Giuffre's civil lawsuit, the two sides reached an out-of-court settlement in February 2022.",
      "Royal commentator Amanda Matta told Fox News Digital that Andrew could potentially face legal consequences over the claims made in Giuffre's book and the newly resurfaced emails.",
      "\"While past civil litigation in the U.S. is concluded, the new memoir revives several potential areas of concern for Andrew,\" she explained. \"Even though he has not (as of yet) been criminally charged, the renewed scrutiny over possible misuse of police resources or attempt to gather personal information on a survivor could trigger regulatory or investigative action.\"",
      "\"If the monarchy faces any renewed questions about oversight, privilege, and accountability, that action might even be greenlit by palace agents,\" Matta added.",
      "Andrew is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police due to newly leaked emails.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Sang Tan, File)",
      "In addition to the emails published by the Mail on Sunday, other leaked correspondence could prove to be a liability for Andrew, according to Fitzwilliams.",
      "On Oct. 12, The Guardian published details of an email dated Feb. 28, 2011 from Andrew to Epstein, which contradicted the royal\u2019s prior claim that he cut contact with the disgraced financier in 2010.",
      "\"I\u2019m just as concerned for you! Don\u2019t worry about me! It would seem we are in this together and will have to rise above it,\" he allegedly wrote in an email sent to Epstein. \"Otherwise keep in close touch and we\u2019ll play some more soon!!!!\"",
      "Both Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson currently reside at Royal Lodge, which is owned by the royal family and located in Windsor Great Park, about three miles south of Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England. (Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",
      "The leaked emails published by the Mail on Sunday emerged days after Andrew announced that he had relinquished his royal titles and honors due to the accusations connecting him with Epstein.",
      "\"In discussion with The King, and my immediate and wider family, we have concluded the continued accusations about me distract from the work of His Majesty and the Royal Family,\" Andrew's statement read. \"I have decided, as I always have, to put my duty to my family and country first.

      "\"The Household Pulse data showed a decline in trans ID among 18- to 22-year-olds in 2024, but I was cautious about drawing conclusions from it, as the decline appeared only in a limited time period (July to September 2024) \u2014 and two of the three survey administrations added an option for non-binary identification that wasn\u2019t there before,\" she wrote. \"Maybe that was why identifying as trans declined.\"",

      "The Cooperative Election Study (CES), a nonprobability-based survey fielded each year in the fall by YouGov and administered by Tufts University, asked about transgender identification among all U.S. adults from 2021 to 2024.

      "\"I think the question now is not if trans is in decline, but how far it will fall.\"",
      "There are several theories as to why this is happening.",
      "\"One possibility is changes in acceptance; as acceptance increased, more young adults identified as transgender and/or were willing to identify as transgender in a survey,\" Twenge said. \"When acceptance declined, identifying as transgender (or at least identifying as transgender on a survey) declined.\"",

      "In previous analyses looking at data from another survey, Twenge found that the increase in identifying as transgender between 2014 and 2023 did not extend to people over age 45 (Gen X and boomers).",
      "\"That makes it less likely that the changes are due to acceptance, which should impact people of all ages,\" she said. \"However, it's possible that acceptance increased more among young adults between 2014 and 2023 and then decreased more into 2024.\"",

      "Do rude prompts really get better answers? Short answer: sometimes. A 2025 arXiv study tested 50 questions rewritten in five tones and found that rude prompts slightly outperformed polite ones with ChatGPT-4o. Accuracy rose from 80.8% for very polite to 84.8% for very rude. The sample was small, yet the pattern was clear.",
      "But not so fast, this story has layers. A 2024 study that looked at multiple languages painted a different picture. It found that impolite prompts often lowered performance, and that the \"best\" level of politeness changed depending on the language. In other words, the details really matter.",

      "Rude prompts made ChatGPT more accurate. Polite ones scored lower. Tone changed the outcome. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why tone might change outcomes",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to mirror the wording they receive. When you sound direct or even a little blunt, you often give clearer instructions. That helps cut down on confusion and pushes the model to deliver sharper, more focused answers. A 2025 paper published on arXiv found that tone alone can shift accuracy by a few points, although more research is needed to confirm those results.",
      "In an earlier study led by researchers from Waseda University and RIKEN AIP, the team compared English, Chinese and Japanese prompts. They discovered that the ideal level of politeness varied by language, showing how cultural norms shape the way AI interprets human requests. In short, what works in one language might not land the same way in another.",
      "Americans split on whether to be polite to AI chatbots",
      "Nearly half of Americans say people should be polite to AI chatbots, according to an April 30, 2025, YouGov survey. Many users do it out of habit or courtesy. Microsoft's design leaders even recommend basic etiquette with Copilot.\u00a0\"Using polite language sets a tone for the response,\" says Kurtis Beavers. Models tend to mirror the professionalism and clarity of your prompt.",
      "A blunt prompt can sharpen results. Direct words help AI focus. Clear beats kind here. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Yes, niceties have a cost",
      "Good manners may be polite, but they are not free. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said people saying\u00a0\"please\" and\u00a0\"thank you\" to ChatGPT costs the company millions of dollars each year. Every extra word adds tokens for the model to process, and those tokens require computing power and electricity.",
      "For a single user, that cost is tiny and hardly noticeable. Yet when millions of users do it all day, those small gestures turn into a major expense. In the end, even kindness comes with a price tag.",
      "CHATGPT MAY ALERT POLICE ON SUICIDAL TEENS",
      "How to prompt for accuracy without being a jerk",
      "Getting better answers from ChatGPT is not about yelling at it. It is about being clear and confident. Here is how to do that without crossing the line.",
      "Start with the goal.\u00a0Tell the model what you want right away. Include the format and any limits up front so it knows where to focus.Get specific.\u00a0Use numbers instead of vague words. \"Write three bullet points\" works better than \"Write a few ideas.\"Add a check. Ask it to review its own steps or measure its answer against a simple checklist. That keeps things on track.Keep your tone firm but calm. You can be direct without being rude. Short, clear sentences usually get the best results.Experiment a little. Try one neutral prompt, one polite version and one more direct. Compare the results and see which one performs best for your task.",

      "Researchers tested three languages. Each reacted differently to politeness. Culture shaped every reply. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Rude prompts and ChatGPT accuracy in practice",
      "Here's where things get interesting. If you're writing math problems, multiple-choice questions or coding tasks, a short, no-nonsense tone might actually help. The 2025 study showed that when users dropped the polite fluff and went straight to the point, ChatGPT's accuracy ticked upward.",
      "Still, don't expect miracles. The difference wasn't huge; think a few percentage points, not a full upgrade. Rude or direct prompts can sharpen a model's focus, but they won't suddenly turn an average prompt into a perfect one. The trick is to treat tone as just one lever in your prompt-engineering toolbox. Clarity, structure and context matter more than attitude.",
      "So, how should you use this in real life?",
      "The findings might sound odd, but they offer a clear takeaway for anyone who uses AI tools daily. Here's how to put them into practice.",
      "Chase clarity, not cruelty.\u00a0Be firm and specific. You can sound confident without sounding cranky.Read the room or the language.\u00a0What's \"direct\" in English might come across as rude in Japanese or overly blunt in Chinese.

Think of tone as the seasoning on a meal, not the main course. The real secret is this: good prompts are clear, confident and purposeful. Whether you choose a polite tone or a more direct one, what matters is explaining exactly what you need. That is how you get consistent, high-quality answers without resorting to rudeness. So before you send your next question, ask yourself this: Are you being too polite to get results, or just polite enough to be understood?",

One by one, global giants are admitting they've been breached, from tech powerhouses like Google to insurance leaders such as Allianz and Farmers and even luxury brands like Dior. The latest company to report a breach is Discord. The popular chat platform confirmed that hackers gained access to a third-party customer support provider, 5CA, exposing user data including names, email addresses, limited billing details and even government ID images.",

      "Hackers hit Discord\u2019s support vendor, exposing sensitive user data worldwide. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "How the breach happened and what data was exposed",
      "The company confirmed that the breach, which occurred on September 20, did not involve a direct attack on Discord's servers. Instead, attackers gained unauthorized access to 5CA, one of Discord's third-party customer service providers. This allowed them to view information from users who had reached out to Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.",
      "Discord is a chat app primarily used by gamers, but it has expanded to various other communities, enabling text messages, voice chats and video calls. Some even use it as a replacement for Slack. The platform currently has a monthly user base of over 200 million. The data exposed included Discord usernames, real names, emails, limited billing details such as payment type and the last four digits of credit cards, IP addresses and messages exchanged with customer service agents. In some cases, government ID images provided for age verification were also compromised. Discord estimates that around 70,000 users globally may have had government ID photos exposed.",
      "Reports suggest the attackers attempted to use this access to demand a ransom from Discord. Bleeping Computer reported that the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters (SLH) threat group claimed responsibility for the attack earlier this month. This is the same group that claims to have access to over a billion Salesforce records and is demanding ransom for those as well.",

      "What Discord is doing now and what users should do next",
      "Discord disclosed the incident 13 days later, on October 3. Since then, it has cut off the third-party support provider's access, launched an internal investigation with a digital forensics team and started informing affected users. It also clarified that any communication about the breach will come only from noreply@discord.com and that it will never contact users by phone regarding this incident. The company added that some data remained safe: full credit card numbers, CCV codes, account passwords and activity outside of customer support conversations were not exposed.",
      "Discord also stated that it has notified relevant data-protection authorities about the breach, is working closely with law enforcement and is auditing its third-party vendors to ensure they meet its enhanced security and privacy standards going forward.",
      "A representative at Discord issued a statement, saying in part, \"We want to address inaccurate claims by those responsible that are circulating online. First, as stated in our blog post, this was not a breach of Discord, but rather a third-party service we use to support our customer service efforts. Second, the numbers being shared are incorrect and part of an attempt to extort a payment from Discord. Of the accounts impacted globally, we have identified approximately 70,000 users that may have had government-ID photos exposed, which our vendor used to review age-related appeals. Third, we will not reward those responsible for their illegal actions.\u00a0All affected users globally have been contacted, and we continue to work closely with law enforcement, data protection authorities and external security experts. We've secured the affected systems and ended work with the compromised vendor. We take our responsibility to protect your personal data seriously and understand the concern this may cause.\"",
      "Discord cuts ties with vendor 5CA and tightens its security investigations. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 steps you can take to stay safe after the Discord breach",
      "If you think your details might have leaked in the Discord data breach, below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra verification step when logging in, making it much harder for attackers to access your account even if they have your password. Discord supports 2FA via authenticator apps or SMS. Once enabled, you'll receive a code each time you log in from a new device. This simple step can prevent account takeovers and gives you peace of mind.",
      "The less information available about you, the harder it is for attackers to target you. Review what personal details you've shared online, and remove unnecessary data from websites and apps. A personal data removal service can help scrub your information from data broker sites, making it more difficult for attackers to connect the dots and launch identity theft or phishing attacks.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Reusing passwords across platforms makes it easy for attackers to access multiple accounts if one password is compromised. A password manager can generate long, complex passwords and store them securely, so you don't have to remember them all. This not only protects your Discord account but also your email, banking and other online services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if you don't see immediate signs of compromise, attackers can try to exploit stolen data later. Regularly check your email and Discord login history for unusual sign-ins. Services like identity theft protection can scan the dark web for your credentials and alert you immediately if they appear, helping you react quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing attacks often spike after breaches. Attackers may send messages that look like official notifications asking you to reset your password or provide personal information. Always verify the sender, avoid clicking unknown links, and never share sensitive info. Treat every unexpected message as suspicious, even if it appears to come from Discord or another trusted service.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "If the recent breaches are any indication, third-party services that companies rely on are often the weakest link in cybersecurity. Discord's steps to contain the situation are necessary, but they highlight a bigger problem. Many companies do not implement sufficient safeguards to protect sensitive user data. Weak oversight of third-party providers, delayed responses and inadequate security policies leave personal information exposed and vulnerable to attackers.",

Even more alarming, two-thirds of parents said they have no idea how their kids are using AI. Experts warn that while AI can simulate empathy, it has no real understanding or care.

      "Attackers embedded hidden instructions into an email using white-on-white text, tiny fonts or CSS layout tricks. The email looked completely harmless. But when a user later asked ChatGPT's Deep Research agent to analyze a Gmail inbox, the AI unknowingly executed the attacker's commands.",
      "The agent then used its built-in browser tools to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server, all within OpenAI's own cloud environment, beyond the reach of antivirus or enterprise firewalls.",

      "Why this threat matters",
      "The Deep Research agent was designed to perform multistep research and summarize online data, but its wide access to third-party apps like Gmail, Google Drive and Dropbox also opened the door to abuse.",
      "Radware researchers said the attack involved encoding personal data in Base64 and appending it to a malicious URL, disguised as a \"security measure.\" Once sent, the agent believed it was acting normally.",
      "The real danger lies in the fact that any connector could be exploited the same way if attackers manage to hide prompts in analyzed content.",
      "What security experts say",
      "\"The user never sees the prompt. The email looks normal, but the agent follows the hidden commands without question,\"\u00a0the researchers explained.",
      "In a separate experiment, security firm SPLX showed another weakness: ChatGPT agents could be tricked into solving CAPTCHAs by inheriting a manipulated conversation history. Researcher Dorian Schultz noted that the model even mimicked human cursor movements, bypassing tests meant to block bots.",

One driver in Houston complained that FSD \"is not recognizing traffic signals,\" saying the car stopped at green lights but ran through reds.

In one high-profile case, a California jury ordered Tesla to pay $329 million after an Autopilot-related crash killed a woman. Another investigation is looking into Tesla's limited Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, where passengers reported erratic driving and speeding \u2014 even with human safety drivers onboard. Meanwhile, Tesla is still fighting a false advertising lawsuit from California's DMV. Regulators say calling the software \"Full Self-Driving\" is misleading, since it requires constant driver supervision. Tesla recently changed the name to \"Full Self-Driving (Supervised)\" to reflect that reality.",

      "Attackers start by probing Teams environments to find weak spots. They look for users with open settings, public profiles or external meeting links. Microsoft warns that \"anonymous participants, guests and external access users\" can give hackers a way in. If your Privacy Mode is off, they can see when you're online, send unwanted chats, or try to join meetings outside your group, even if you're just using a free account.",

They create fake profiles and logos that look convincing to trick you into clicking a link or sharing credentials. Microsoft says attackers \"take advantage of the same resources as legitimate organizations\" to pull off their scams.",

You might get a message saying,\u00a0\"Your Teams account needs verification\" or \"Update required for better security.\" It's all bait. These links can install spyware, steal logins or deliver ransomware that locks up your data, whether you're on a company laptop or your personal PC at home.",

      "If you share your Teams account with coworkers or family members, don't give everyone full control. Keep admin access limited to one trusted person. This reduces the chance of someone accidentally approving a scam link or letting malware spread.",
      "Hackers often rely on personal details found online to make their scams more convincing, things like your job title, workplace or even who you've video-chatted with. That information helps them build fake Teams profiles or send messages that look legitimate.

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "You might have noticed that in the past few months, many companies have disclosed data breaches, including Google, Dior and Allianz, and one name that appeared in most cases was Salesforce. Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale. Nearly a billion records were stolen across dozens of organizations, and now cybercriminals are extorting victims by threatening to publish the data unless hefty ransoms are paid. Let's look at the recent Salesforce incidents in detail and why this is such a big deal.",

      "JEEP AND CHRYSLER PARENT STELLANTIS CONFIRMS DATA BREACH",
      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

      "On his visit to Israel this week, Ambassador-Designate for International Religious Freedom Mark Walker said meeting families of hostages and survivors of Hamas captivity left him \"overwhelmed,\" reaffirming what he called the \"spiritual and historic bond\" between the United States and Israel.",
      "Walker, a former Republican congressman and Baptist pastor from North Carolina, was nominated by\u00a0President Donald Trump to serve as the nation\u2019s top global envoy for religious liberty. He will officially assume the post once confirmed by the Senate, becoming the seventh American to hold the role since it was created by Congress in 1998.",
      "His visit to Israel, he explained, was driven by both friendship and timing. \"All these other historic landmark agreements are happening the same week we\u2019re here,\" Walker said. \"It\u2019s been amazing to see the excitement \u2014 literally banners hanging from buildings and parks thanking President Trump for his ongoing efforts and the strength he\u2019s shown to drive the region toward peace.\"",

      "\"I was overwhelmed to spend some time with Keith Siegel, who endured 483 days of captivity and torture, and with\u00a0Ruby Chen, whose son, Itay, was killed by Hamas \u2014 his body still not returned,\" Walker said. \"To hear the passion in Ruby\u2019s voice, to see his perseverance, it\u2019s overwhelming. In America, we\u2019re watching this from a distance. But being here on the ground, seeing how the community has banded together to stand up for these hostages \u2014 alive or dead \u2014 has impacted me in a different manner.\"",
      "The experience, he said, deepened his appreciation for Israel\u2019s resilience. \"The people of Israel have stood resiliently in the face of evil,\" he said. \"Their faith and courage remind the world what strength looks like.\"",

He\u2019s committed to peace and showing it with his actions \u2014 sending Vice President Vance, Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff here this week.\"",
      "He also praised Secretary of State\u00a0Marco Rubio for advancing the administration\u2019s diplomatic agenda. \"This isn\u2019t a photo opportunity,\" Walker said. \"It\u2019s a real plan for long-term stability.\"",
      "When asked how he views Israel\u2019s importance, Walker reflected on his years in Congress.",
      "\"I think historically, we\u2019ve had a long-standing relationship of supporting each other through times of peril as well as times of success,\" he said. \"Certainly, military and business relationships, but from a spiritual standpoint, America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles.\"",

But there\u2019s only one historical figure looking directly at the speaker\u2019s rostrum, and that\u2019s Moses.

      "When asked about criticism from some within the evangelical community regarding its close alignment with Israel, Walker said he welcomes open discussion but rejects efforts to undermine the partnership. \"I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone questioning \u2014 we ought to be able to defend those relationships,\" he said. \"But when you see some of the talk lately that aims to degrade that relationship, maybe for personal gain or attention, I do have a problem with it, and I think it needs to be condemned.\"",
      "He added that such views are far from mainstream. \"The evangelical communities that I\u2019m part of \u2014 and I happen to be a member of the largest Protestant organization in the United States \u2014 don\u2019t have those issues,\" he said. \"There may be some who are loosely affiliated and use that kind of rhetoric, but the overwhelming majority of evangelicals in America applaud and encourage the relationship we have with Israel.\"",

      "On his new role, Walker said the mission was deeply personal.",
      "\"When President Trump reached out and asked us to serve as the ambassador for International Religious Freedom \u2014 that\u2019s a global position \u2014 it was humbling,\" he said. \"The responsibility is to advocate for people of all faiths, especially in places where they\u2019re persecuted or punished by blasphemy laws.\"",

      "He added that Israel\u2019s example of tolerance stands out in the Middle East. \"Christians should be able to live peaceably, share their faith and worship without fear,\" he said. \"The fact that Israel allows that in a region where so many others don\u2019t is meaningful.\"",

      "The thieves behind the daring Louvre Museum heist in Paris, France, appear to have used a truck-mounted moving lift \u2014 the kind professional movers use to hoist furniture up to apartment windows \u2014 in order to scale the building\u2019s second floor, according to Laure Beccuau, the Paris prosecutor.",
      "The burglars pretended they were hiring the freight lift for a move and when the equipment owner or representative arrived to verify the job, the suspects threatened that person, forcing them to hand it over and leave the scene, Beccuau said in an interview with RTL radio, according to The New York Times.",
      "Authorities said the thieves spent less than four minutes inside the Louvre on Sunday morning. They allegedly wheeled the vehicle to the Seine-facing fa\u00e7ade, a window was forced open and two vitrines were smashed.",
      "The thieves made away with a total of eight objects, including a sapphire diadem, necklace and single earring from a set linked to 19th-century queens Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Hortense. The heist has prompted a national reckoning, with some officials comparing the shock to the 2019\u00a0burning of Notre-Dame cathedral.",
      "They also stole an emerald necklace and earrings tied to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s second wife, and a reliquary brooch.

      "The pieces were not insured, which is not uncommon for state collections because of the prohibitive costs, the Times reported, citing France\u2019s culture ministry.

      "Hugh Dugan, who served on the National Security Council as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for International Organization Affairs in 2020, told Fox News Digital, \"UNRWA\u2019s mission was to provide\u00a0relief and support pending a durable political solution.\u00a0 As such, a solution is at hand \u2013 pending Hamas\u2019 compliance to disarm immediately \u2013 truly neutral humanitarian operations beg for new measures and modalities.\"",
      "He added, \"The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation for months has distributed aid independently of U.N. channels and has prevented diversion by militant groups.\u00a0Other U.N. humanitarian operations would be well-served to take cover and operate within GHF\u2019s shadow under the blistering sun of critical human need.\"",

      "Dugan, a former diplomat who served at the U.S. mission to the world body, said UNRWA has turned a cottage industry into a sprawling transnational bureaucracy that has perpetuated financial waste and prolonged the conflict by granting refugee status to the descendants of Palestinian refugees after the first Israel-Arab states\u2019 war.",
      "\"After the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict, UNRWA\u2019s critical mission was to provide direct relief and works program for 800,000 Palestinian refugees. Its job was to put itself out of business as soon as possible, however it went the route of mission creep.\u00a0Over decades managerially captured by the U.N. bureaucracy, UNRWA perpetuates the status of refugees now swelling to 5.9 million,\" he said.",
      "Dugan concluded, \"After billions of dollars,\u00a0Palestinians continue in desperate\u00a0dependence for humanitarian aid of the most basic kind. This has positioned UNRWA as a political actor in its own right beyond its original mission. And its politics and relations with Hamas reveal that UNRWA lost irretrievably its grounding in humanitarian neutrality and non-discrimination.\"",

What these claims have done, most importantly, is they have banned UNRWA, the largest humanitarian organization, from delivering food to hungry people.\"",
      "Touma said \"It also put my colleagues in Gaza in danger and have put their lives at serious risks due to this dis-information. UNRWA has 12,000 staff on the ground in Gaza It is impossible to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza without UNRWA and its teams.

      "In remarks after her election, Takaichi said she felt \"the tough work starts here\" and promised to restore public confidence and strengthen Japan\u2019s security posture. Over the years, she has praised Thatcher\u2019s \"strength and womanly warmth\" as qualities she seeks to emulate.

      "\"As we continue to expand the euthanasia regime, all the safeguards and windows have gone out the window,\" said Mike Schouten. \"And it becomes open season for anyone to choose death, including children.\"",

      "What began as a limited effort to provide adults with terminal illnesses the ability to end pain and suffering has now grown into an international industry. According to a\u00a0database compiled by the Pearl Project, a nonprofit journalism initiative, at least 96 organizations worldwide are now part of this movement.",
      "The global lobby cloaks assisted suicide in the language of civil rights and human rights, using euphemisms in their names, such as \"assisted dying,\" \"medical assistance in dying,\" \"dying with dignity,\" \"choice,\" \"end of life,\" \"completed life,\" \"final exit,\" \"free exit\" and the \"right to die.\"",
      "These groups have a presence on every continent, but are predominately found in the West, which also faces alarmingly low birth rates. There are 41 groups in Europe; 31 groups in North America, with 25 of them in the United States, four in Canada and two in Mexico; 13 in Oceania, with most in Australia and one in New Zealand; and only five in Asia, two in Africa, and three in South America.",

      "The boundaries are shifting. Behind the push to extend these laws to children lies a legal Trojan horse: the \"mature minor doctrine.\"",
      "This concept, first established in a 1967 Washington Supreme Court case,\u00a0Smith v. Seibly,\u00a0once allowed limited medical discretion for minors. But over decades, it has metastasized into a sweeping jurisdiction for granting children autonomy \u2013 and\u00a0secrecy \u2013 over their medical decisions. Today, it lets minors make choices without parental involvement on gender pronouns, gender transitions, contraception and abortion. In 13 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, minors can even\u00a0obtain abortions without parental knowledge.",

      "Euthanasia is already legal for adults in Australia, Belgium, Colombia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and 11 U.S. states. But three countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Belgium and Colombia \u2013 have gone further, allowing \"mature minors\" to die by physician-assisted suicide.",
      "In February 2023, despite the pleas of Marcus and his parents, Canada\u2019s Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying\u00a0recommended extending the right to some youth, declaring that parents should be \"consulted\" but that the \"will of a minor\" with decision-making capacity \"ultimately takes priority.\"",
      "The same debate has now reached the United Kingdom, where a bill to allow adult euthanasia is\u00a0moving through the British Parliament. Earlier this year, the British House of Commons narrowly\u00a0voted 259 to 216 to bar physicians from discussing assisted suicide with youth, meaning nearly half of lawmakers supported discussing assisted suicide for youth.",

      "\"Assisted suicide will spread, full stop,\" she told Fox Digital. \"And the people allowed to do assisted suicide will grow, making it younger and younger.\"",
      "Birbalsingh argues that Western societies have fallen for the dangerous illusion that \"the child must lead,\" leading to thinking such as \"Oh, he wants to change his gender, or he wants to commit suicide.\"",
      "\"Once upon a time,\" she said, \"adults used to say, \u2018No, the child is not capable of leading, because he is a child.\u2018 In the West, we have forgotten that we\u2019re meant to be in charge as adults.\"",
      "\"There's just a million reasons why young people would want to choose death,\" said Birbalsingh, the founder of the Michaela Community School in London. \"You know, young people are compulsive, they make whimsical decisions. They make irresponsible decisions. They're young. That's sort of the definition of a child.\"",
      "\"That's why they need looking after,\" Birbalsingh added. \"That's why we need to look after them as adults. That's our job. It's our role in life, to keep and protect them, sometimes from themselves. The people making these decisions just don't understand young people.\" Lawmakers said there was a \"very real risk\" that proposed assisted suicide legislation, called the \"Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill,\" would be expanded to include children if they didn\u2019t vote for her amendment.",

      "In Canada, the euphemism \"MAID,\" or \"Medical Assistance In Dying,\" has softened the conversation. But the statistics are stark. In 2023, about 15,000 Canadians died through \"MAID,\" about one in every 20 deaths nationwide, a 16% increase from 2022, making assisted suicide the fifth leading cause of death.",
      "The movement is also big business. Dying with Dignity Canada, based in Toronto,\u00a0reported $3 billion in expenses in 2024, including $803,555 for advertising and promotions. It publicly\u00a0argues that \"mature minors should be allowed the right to choose MAID,\" calling it \"unfair\" to deny a 17-year-old what a 70-year-old is granted.",

      "Roggio, also editor of the FDD\u2019s Long War Journal, added, \"The reality is that the situation was bad before the U.S. and French left the region, but the drawdown of U.S. and French forces has exacerbated the jihadist advances.\"",
      "\"Both al Qaeda\u2019s branch in the region, JNIM, (al Qaeda-linked Jama\u2019a Nusrat Al-Islam wa al-Muslimin) and the Islamic State have made gains and control significant enclaves in the countries \u2026 The juntas in these three countries wanted the West out, and have turned to Russia to provide security via Wagner, which is now ironically called the Africa Corps.\"",

      "\"The Russian forces have little incentive to improve security and focus on securing mineral resources for profit,\" Roggio added. \"This further fuels the jihadist insurgencies, which prey on civilians caught between the jihadists and weak-to-nonexistent governments in some cases. There is little the U.S. can do at the moment, as these governments are anti-West and do not want a return of U.S. and French forces. And I am not sure either country has the political will or desire to return.\"",
      "Dr. Frans Cronje, a political and economic analyst, said in an interview with Fox News Digital that during the run-up to the 2023 coup in Niger, a sophisticated political and media campaign sought to turn public opinion against Western influence, often using anti-colonial themes popular in Western political culture.",
      "Russia's Wagner group mercenaries in Mali, Africa.\u00a0 (East2West)",
      "Cronje continued, \"French and U.S. stabilization efforts were tarred as imperialist interference and worse. That was on top of the fact that French and U.S. troops were already under severe strain in combating a jihadist insurgency that threatened the civilian population. You could make the case that even without the coup, the Western position was untenable, short of committing ever greater volumes of arms and munitions to a war very far away from Paris and Washington.\"",
      "Cronje agreed with Roggio in his assessment of the Kremlin\u2019s position: \"Russia\u2019s forces have now filled the gap left by the French and Americans, but Russia\u2019s objective is securing resource supply chains \u2014 not civilians.\"",

The only way to do it would have been to run political and media operations to build popular support for Western actors, then install a pro-Western administration and, beyond that, vastly increase Western military resources, including troops, deployed in Niger.

      "Kramnik, who has accused many players of cheating in online play, first voiced \"concerns\" about Naroditsky's play last year, leading to an ongoing feud between the two players.

    "story": [
      "Lawyers gave their opening statements to a jury at the Peoria County Courthouse on Wednesday morning, officially kicking off the trial of a former Illinois deputy accused of fatally shooting Sonya Massey.",
      "Sean Grayson, 31, shot Massey, a 36-year-old Black mother of two,  in June 2024 after she called authorities to her Springfield home about a possible prowler. The former Sangamon County sheriff\u2019s deputy, who is white, said in a report written after the incident that he feared bodily harm because Massey was holding a pot of boiling water and said, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d",
      "Nearly two weeks later, Grayson was fired and charged with first-degree murder, one count of aggravated battery and one count of official misconduct. He pleaded not guilty and was held in jail pending trial.",
      "This week, the aggravated battery and official misconduct charges were dropped at the request of the prosecutors with no objection from the defense.",
      "Jury selection began Monday when 12 jurors and 3 alternates were sworn in. No cameras are allowed in the courtroom as the judge has said he does not want the jury to get distracted, and thinks cameras can change how people act and testify.",
      "John Milhiser, the state\u2019s attorney for Sangamon County, said in his opening statement that Grayson went into Massey\u2019s home where she \u201cwas not a suspect\u201d and shot and killed her \u201cwithout lawful justification.\u201d",
      "Milhiser noted that Grayson did not immediately turn on his body camera that night, which is part of a pattern of not following policies or training. He said Grayson shot Massey because he was angry.",
      "In the lead up to the shooting, Milhiser says Massey was \"nice and kind\" when talking Grayson and his partner.  He describes what happens on the body camera video as \u201cwhat happens when the defendant gets mad at a woman who is standing in her own kitchen.\u201d",
      "Grayson's attorney, Daniel L Fultz, said in his opening statement that evidence will show that the former deputy lawfully discharged his weapon and acted to protect his life.",
      "\"He believed he would suffer great bodily harm or death,\" he said.",
      "He said that Grayson had warned Massey to put down the pot of water before firing his weapon.",
      "\"What happened to Ms. Massey was a tragedy, but it was not a crime,\" Fultz said.",
      "Fultz asked jurors to avoid forming opinions on the case early on, and argued that while police officers are often called to run towards danger, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean when danger presents itself, they can\u2019t defend themselves.\u201d",
      "Grayson appeared in court wearing a black suit and glasses. He sometimes rocked back and forth in his chair and glanced at the courtroom gallery, where media and members of Massey\u2019s family were seated.",
      "Massey's killing triggered a national response, igniting protests across the country. Protesters gathered outside the courthouse Monday to call for justice for Massey, who had mental health issues, according to her family.",
      "Her death raised new questions about U.S. law enforcement shootings of Black people in their homes and it prompted a change in Illinois law requiring fuller transparency on the background of candidates for law enforcement jobs.",
      "The prosecution's first witness, an Illinois State Police officer who investigates officer-involved shootings, testified that he was called to document the scene, but was surprised when he saw the body camera footage in the days after.",
      "\u201cI just thought there had to be something more. Verbal threats, lengthy interactions, something that would have led to a deadly force interaction,\u201d Weston testified.",
      "The trial is expected to last a week and a half."

    "summary": "The first half of 2025 was the most costly ever recorded for weather disasters, according to a new report. NOAA used to track this data, but the Trump administration cut the program.",
    "story": [
      "The first half of this year was the costliest ever recorded for weather and climate disasters in the United States, according to an analysis published Wednesday by the nonprofit organization Climate Central.",
      "It is information that the public might never have learned: This spring, the Trump administration cut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration program that had tracked weather events that caused at least $1 billion in damage. The researcher who led that work, Adam Smith, left NOAA over the decision.",
      "Climate Central, a research group focused on the effects of climate change, hired Smith to redevelop the database, which includes records back to 1980.",
      "According to the organization\u2019s new analysis, 14 weather events exceeded $1 billion in damages in the first six months of 2025. The January wildfires in Los Angeles were, by far, the most expensive natural disaster so far this year \u2014 they caused more than $61 billion in damage. That also makes them the most expensive wildfire event on record.",
      "The findings show how the costs of weather and climate disasters continue to escalate as extreme weather grows more frequent and intense, and as populations spread into areas prone to costly destruction from wildfires and flooding.",
      "The report itself is also an example of the way nonprofit groups are increasingly taking over federal projects that once tracked and quantified the effects of climate change as the Trump administration makes cuts to climate science. President Donald Trump has called climate change a \u201ccon job.\u201d His administration has cut funding for clean energy projects and is trying to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that is causing global warming.",
      "Jennifer Brady, a senior data analyst and research manager at Climate Central who worked on the project, said the shuttering of NOAA\u2019s billion-dollar disasters database upset staff at the nonprofit, who decided to take matters into their own hands.",
      "\u201cThis has always been one of our favorite datasets. It\u2019s told so many different stories. It tells the climate change story. It tells the story of where people are living, how they\u2019re living at risk,\u201d Brady said. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to bring it back.\u201d",
      "Kim Doster, a NOAA spokesperson, said the agency \u201cappreciates that the Billion Dollar Disaster Product has found a funding mechanism other than the taxpayer dime.\u201d",
      "\u201cNOAA will continue to refocus its resources on products that adhere to the President\u2019s Executive Order restoring gold standard science, prioritizing sound, unbiased research,\u201d Doster said in an email.",
      "The database was a politically polarizing project. House Republicans complained to NOAA\u2019s administrator in 2024 about the program, voicing concerns about what they described as \u201cdeceptive data.\u201d Last month, Senate Democrats introduced legislation that would require NOAA to publish the dataset and update it twice a year, saying that lawmakers used the reports to inform disaster funding decisions. But the bill remains in committee and stands little chance of passing in the Republican-controlled Senate.",
      "Last month, a Trump administration official told NBC News that NOAA had ended the database project because of uncertainties in how it estimated the costs of disasters. The official said that the project cost about $300,000 annually, that it required substantial staff hours and that the data \u201cserves no decisional purpose and remains purely informational at best.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis data is often used to advance the narrative that climate change is making disasters more frequent, more extreme, and more costly, without taking into account other factors such as increased development on flood plains or other weather-impacted spots or the cyclical nature of the climate in various regions,\u201d the official said at the time.",
      "Brady, however, said the database has always acknowledged changes in population and climate variability as important factors in the cost of disasters.",
      "Climate Central\u2019s work uses the same methodology and data sources that NOAA\u2019s database did, she said. Those sources include National Flood Insurance Program claims, NOAA storm events data and private property insurance data, among others.",
      "The analysis captures the \u201cdirect costs\u201d of disasters, such as damage to buildings, infrastructure and crops. It doesn\u2019t factor other considerations, including loss of life, health-related costs of disasters or the economic losses to \u201cnatural capital\u201d such as forests or wetlands. The data is adjusted to account for inflation.",
      "The new analysis of the first half of 2025 indicates that this year is on pace to be one of the costliest on record, even though no hurricanes have made landfall in the continental U.S.",
      "Last year, NOAA counted 27 billion-dollar disasters, with costs that totaled about $182.7 billion. That was the second highest number of billion-dollar disasters in the report\u2019s history, after 2023.",
      "Climate Central is not the only group stepping in to re-create work the federal government used to do as the Trump administration makes cuts to climate science.",
      "A group of staffers laid off from NOAA has launched climate.us, a nonprofit successor to climate.gov, a federal website that once provided data and analysis to explain climate issues to the broader public. The site went dark this summer.",
      "Rebecca Lindsey, who edited climate.gov before she was laid off in February, said she and the other NOAA employees who co-founded the nonprofit have raised about $160,000. They plan to host the climate.gov archives on the new site and start publishing new articles about climate change in the next few weeks.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re rescuing this information and making sure when people need answers about what\u2019s happening with the climate, they\u2019ll be able to find them,\u201d Lindsey said.",
      "The American Geophysical Union and American Meteorological Society also announced that they plan to publish a special collection of research focused on climate change, after the Trump administration told scientists volunteering to work on the National Climate Assessment \u2014 a comprehensive synthesis of research about climate change and its effects in the U.S.  \u2014 that they were no longer needed.",
      "The administration laid off staffers in the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which organized the National Climate Assessment and coordinated climate research programs across different federal agencies.",
      "Walter Robinson, publications commissioner for the American Meteorological Society, said the National Climate Assessment had been \u201ceffectively canceled\u201d by the administration\u2019s decisions, which he viewed as an \u201cabrogation\u201d of the federal government\u2019s responsibility.",
      "The new collection can\u2019t replace the assessment, he added, but it aims to organize the latest science on the effects of climate change in the U.S. in one place. The research will be released across several scientific journals on a rolling basis.",
      "\u201cPeople are stepping in,\u201d Robinson said of his group\u2019s efforts. \u201cAs scientists, we do what we can.\u201d"

      "\u201cI really want to be away. I really want to have a massive change. I really want something else completely different than what I\u2019ve had. But I hate being away from family.

    "summary": "What are the best heist movies to watch after the Louvre heist? Here's a list of the best art heist movies and why they appeal.",
    "story": [
      "A seven-minute heist in broad daylight from the most-visited museum in the world is like something straight out of a movie.",
      "For French authorities and officials at the Louvre, the daring robbery by four suspects on Oct. 19 is all too real as they work to try recover eight pieces from France's crown jewels that they say were taken.",
      "The cinematic nature of the heist, which authorities said involved using a truck with a basket lift, cutting tools and a pair of scooters, gave it some of the elements of a classic heist movie.",
      "\"Heist movies where you root the most for the team are when it's against a faceless institution,\" Paul Caiola, co-host of the movie podcast That Aged Well, tells TODAY.com. \"We all know what the Louvre is, and we can romanticize this team thanks to movies and pop culture. We go to a different place because the victim is not a human. I'm sure security guards didn\u2019t have great time afterward, but that\u2019s not who we think about when we think about the heist.\"",
      "The real-life drama brings to mind several films and shows that depict classic works of art or priceless jewels being snatched by a cunning crew.",
      "The best heist films and shows also usually have certain ingredients in common.",
      "\"You have some Robin Hood-type lead played by a movie star like George Clooney, Sandra Bullock or Robert Redford \u2014 someone the audience always loves,\" Caiola says. \"Then you put them against a bad guy the audience wants to root against, or a faceless institution.\"",
      "The feeling of the common man or woman taking from a powerful institution or person is also alluring.",
      "\"The bills, the jewels, the gems, the artworks: they are stowed away behind gates, doors, walls; shielded by locks, safes, impenetrable glass; protected by lasers, surveillance cameras, and motion detectors. Since ordinary people are always denied access to them, this exclusion allegorizes a key experience of modernity: being distanced from the centers of wealth and power,\" Julian Hanich of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands wrote in \"On Pros and Cons and Bills and Gates: The Heist Film as Pleasure\" in 2017.",
      "Once the two sides are established, next up is the crew.",
      "\"We all love found family, and watching people with a particular set of skills joining up to pull off a heist is thrilling,\" Caiola says. \"Then you ultimately get to watch how they do it. How are they going to get Tom Cruise past that pressure-sensitive floor in 'Mission Impossible'? What movie magic is going to get Catherine Zeta-Jones past that laser net in 'Entrapment'? \"",
      "It can't just be some smash-and-grab, either.",
      "\"It has to be complex, with plans within plans, which takes us away from ourselves and gives us that sense of escape,\" Caiola says. \"Then when it's over, what's the fallout? Do they get away with it?\"",
      "While there are a host of classic heist films like \"Ocean's Eleven\" and \"The Town\" where the crew is going after cash, these are focused on stealing precious artworks or valuable jewels.",
      "They also are a little more artsy and refined than a wild Indiana Jones adventure in search of the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant.",
      "There also is a new film that was released on Oct. 17 called \"The Mastermind\" with \"Challengers\" star Josh O'Connor that may quickly join the pantheon. It's inspired by a 1972 robbery of four paintings from an art museum in Massachusetts.",
      "'The Thomas Crown Affair'",
      "The 1999 film stars Pierce Brosnan as a suave billionaire who swipes a Monet painting from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art and lends another painting to the museum to take its place. It shows him as a classic art thief in that he appreciates the artwork more than he's completely motivated by money.",
      "He's pursued by an insurance investigator played by Rene Russo, who falls in love with him before she believes she is betrayed by him.",
      "'Entrapment '",
      "It turns out 1999 was a big year for art heist films with big movie stars, as this one features Catherine Zeta-Jones and Sean Connery.",
      "Just like Russo in \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" Zeta-Jones portrays an insurance investigator on the hunt for Connery's art thief, although her job turns out to be a cover for her own identity as a thief.",
      "The classic shot from this movie is Catherine Zeta-Jones in a skintight outfit deftly moving through a field of laser beams while wearing a blindfold. She is training at a Scottish castle with Connery for the exact moves she will have to execute for a later heist.",
      "Connery is later revealed to have been an informant for the FBI helping to entrap Zeta-Jones' character, whom he then helps escape before they are reunited.",
      "'Lupin'",
      "The 2021 Netflix hit stars Omar Sy as the title character of Assane Diop, a master of disguise and illusion who was inspired by a fictional early 1900s character named Arsene Lupin.",
      "In his quest to seek revenge in memory of his late father, he steals an expensive diamond necklace from the family that wrongly accused his father of once pilfering it. The theft touches off a series of events that eventually lead to the son of Sy's character being kidnapped at the end of the first season.",
      "An episode in Season 2 involves pretending to steal a priceless Pissaro painting, and the show features numerous escapes, disguises and subterfuge.",
      "'Ocean\u2019s Twelve'",
      "This is the series that more than fulfills Caiola's \"get a big-name movie star to portray the thief\" rule for a good heist film, and then some.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" is the first sequel to the classic \"Ocean's Eleven\" in which a gang of thieves led by George Clooney and Brad Pitt rob a Las Vegas casino owned by Terry Benedict, a villainous character played by Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Ocean's Twelve\" reunites the gang, which also includes Julia Roberts and Matt Damon, after Benedict tracks them down and demands they return the stolen money. He gives them two weeks to come up with it. This time there is more of a precious artifact twist compared to the cash heist in the original film.",
      "Their target becomes the Imperial Coronation Faberg\u00e9 egg, which they plan to take during an exhibition in Rome. A couple of double crosses result in the crew getting their money to pay back Benedict in the end.",
      "'The Score'",
      "Following on the heels of \"Entrapment\" and \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" this Robert DeNiro vehicle from 2001 stars the legendary actor as an ace safe-cracker.",
      "This one might hit a little close to home for the people of France after the Louvre theft because it's about stealing an item considered in the movie to be a French national treasure.",
      "DeNiro and a crew that also includes Edward Norton aim to steal a royal scepter from the Montreal Customs House in Canada and its impenetrable safe. This fits the goal of complexity for a good heist film because it involves an elaborate scheme that features disguises, explosives and sneaking through sewer tunnels.",
      "'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'",
      "The sequel to the \"Knives Out\" whodunit, this 2022 movie returns Daniel Craig's master detective Benoit Blanc to unravel a mystery.",
      "A tech billionaire played by Edward Norton hosts a murder mystery at his private island on Greece in which he displays the iconic \"Mona Lisa,\" which he claims to have on loan from the Louvre.",
      "The movie has secret twins, a mysterious alternative fuel, power outages, and of course, murders. It does not end well for the \"Mona Lisa.\"",
      "'The Great Muppet Caper'",
      "If you're looking for a heist with a lighter side, what better cast could you have than the Muppets?",
      "The 1981 film is still a family favorites. It features Kermit, Fozzie and Gonzo on the hunt for a jewel thief with the help of Miss Piggy. Do the Muppets capture the villains and save the day? You already know.",
      "\"The Great Muppet Caper is a classic heist,\" Caiola says. \"And Muppets, they make everything better.\""

      "On Oct. 1, the musicians sent a letter with their requests to the Broadway League, the national trade association for the Broadway industry. It was signed by nearly all 1,200 Broadway musicians.",
      "The union says that the Broadway League \"continues to demand unacceptable wages and reduced jobs and benefits in the current contract talks.\"",
      "Suttmann elaborated on the fears many union members have in a statement.",
      "\u201cOn the heels of the most successful season(s) in history, the Broadway League wants the working musicians and artists who fueled that very success to accept wage cuts, threats to healthcare benefits, and potential job losses. Faced with such an egregious erosion of their working conditions, Local 802 Broadway musicians and other artists are ready to leverage every ounce of their collective power, up to and including a strike. Committing to anything less would mean sacrificing far too many hard-won gains,\u201d he said.",

      "Tension boiled over when Ali learned from the girlfriend of one of Anton\u2019s friends that her fianc\u00e9 frequently enjoyed partying and visiting strip clubs. She addressed her concerns with him and Anton tried to settle her worries.",

      "What Happened Between Ali and Anton the Pods?",
      "Ali and Anton became the first Season 9 couple to get engaged and to meet each other in real life. While in the pods, they bonded over their multicultural backgrounds \u2014 Ali\u2019s Brazilian heritage and Anton\u2019s Russian roots \u2014 and instantly fell for each other. When they saw each other for the first time, they shared multiple kisses and gushed about their mutual attraction.",
      "Their connection seemed to develop swiftly, and Ali told TODAY.com that the pod part of the experiment also felt fast in real life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sped up, but it didn\u2019t feel too fast,\u201d she shared. \u201cAs far as Anton, I think he was just very much himself and very much grounded in what he wanted and what he was looking for. And that really attracted me to him.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cIt was literally him for me from day one, and it continued to be him through the whole experiment. I was very sure.\u201d",
      "What Happened After Ali and Anton Moved in Together?",
      "With Ali\u2019s job as a nurse and Anton working as a truck driver, the two discovered shortly after moving in together that they both worked nights and would rarely see each other. When they were home at the same time, the two bickered about cooking, cleaning and if they would have traditional roles in their marriage.",
      "After meeting Anton\u2019s friends, Ali became skeptical that their relationship would work when she learned her fianc\u00e9 often spent his nights out at strip clubs. She also worried about Anton\u2019s alcohol consumption. She confronted him in Episode 10 after noticing that multiple beers and a bottle of tequila had disappeared from the refrigerator after a few days. But he assured her he didn\u2019t drink too much.",
      "During her bachelorette party, Ali\u2019s friends added to her list of concerns. They wondered if Anton made enough money to support Ali\u2019s lavish lifestyle.",
      "In her interview with TODAY.com, Ali acknowledged that the two struggled with their contrasting lifestyles when they left the pods.",
      "\u201cI think, honestly, going into the real world the biggest obstacle was probably just combining our lifestyles, making sure that expectations were set for what day to day life was going to look like,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo getting past that, I think really made the biggest difference for us.\u201d",
      "Did Ali and Anton Get Married?",
      "At his bachelor party, Anton said that he planned to say \u201cyes.\u201d His confidence in his decision remained when he arrived on his wedding day.",
      "\u201cI did find my person. Whether or not she found her person remains to be seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Ali appeared to be unsettled as she explained that their wedding was the biggest day of her life. She also told her family she felt like she was going to faint.",
      "During his vows, Anton said he was looking forward to building a life with Ali. She said it was \u201ceasy\u201d to fall in love with him. But after Anton said \u201cI do,\u201d she rejected him.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t be your wife. I feel like the person that I fell in love with in the pods isn\u2019t the person I\u2019ve gotten to experience in real life,\u201d she explained.",
      "After being consoled by her family, Ali shared in her last confessional interview why she couldn\u2019t marry Anton.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel like he was super forthcoming about his lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cDrinking, partying, how active he is, how healthily he eats. Some of the information that I learned about Anton through his friends threw off my perspective of him.\u201d",
      "Anton said didn\u2019t understand Ali\u2019s remark about him being a different person outside of the pods."

      "The 83-year-old Hollywood mogul, who has been married to von Furstenberg since 2001, released a memoir titled \u201cWho Knew\u201d in March in which he opened up about his sexuality. He wrote in the book, \u201cYes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",
      "During a new interview with Variety, von Furstenberg, 78, responded to her husband\u2019s comments and discussed their marriage.",
      "When the reporter asked how she supported her husband after he publicly addressed his sexuality, she pushed back.",
      "\u201cSupporting him? What do you mean, supporting him?\u201d she replied in the interview published Oct. 16. \u201cPeople see it that way. For me, it\u2019s not that way. I don\u2019t know. Yes, I encouraged him to do that book, and yes, I encouraged him to do the Audible.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cBut for me, the book is not about that. It\u2019s about his life. And of course, with me, he opened immediately. For 50 years, I was the only person he opened to. Then he wrote the book.\u201d",
      "Von Furstenberg then seemed baffled after she was asked about being married to a gay man.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she said.",
      "She further explained, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change anything. I\u2019m sorry \u2014 it\u2019s a stupid question. I married two gay men, OK? I don\u2019t know why, but to me, they\u2019re not gay, so it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d",
      "Before she tied the knot with Diller, von Furstenberg was previously married to Prince Egon von F\u00fcrstenberg, who died in 2004. The two officially divorced in 1983 after marrying in 1969.",
      "When asked about the start of her relationship with Diller, the Belgian fashion icon said their romance was unexpected. \u201cHe turned out to be my soulmate. I didn\u2019t think of it at first. He was a man about town,\u201d she recalled. Von Furstenberg said the two met at a party she threw for the late talent manager Sue Mengers.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would be anything else. Then it turned to passion. He was very insistent,\u201d the wrap dress creator shared.",
      "She said he called her the following day and the two had dinner. He later invited her to meet him in Los Angeles and picked her up in a limousine.",
      "Diller also reflected on their relationship in an excerpt from his book published by New York Magazine on May 6. He echoed the sentiment that his wife was initially dismissive of him before they met at the dinner party. \u201cI was instantly bathed in such attention and cozy warmth I couldn\u2019t believe it was the same woman I\u2019d been dismissed by a year earlier,\u201d he said.",
      "Diller added that they later had dinner at her apartment and \u201cafterward, on the same sofa as the night before, we wound around each other, making out like teenagers, something I hadn\u2019t done with a female since I was 16 years old.\u201d",
      "He recalled feeling pure excitement and was confused about what it meant.",
      "They went on to date for a few years before splitting in 1981. They reconciled after von Furstenberg had an affair with Richard Gere, Diller revealed in the memoir.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve lived for decades reading about Diane and me: about us being best friends rather than lovers,\u201d Diller said in his book. \u201cWe weren\u2019t just friends. We aren\u2019t just friends. Plain and simple, it was an explosion of passion that kept up for years. And, yes, I also liked guys, but that was not a conflict with my love for Diane.\u201d",
      "A couple weeks after the excerpt was released, Diller shared more details about the book during a CNBC interview that aired on TODAY on May 20.",
      "He rejected the notion that he had been in the closet for decades.",
      "\u201cAll this closet stuff, I mean, if I have been in a closet, it has been the most brightly lit closet with a glass door that you have ever seen,\u201d Diller said at the time. \u201cI understand, kind of, the catnip of media \u2014 but all this stuff about my sexuality at my frigging age just seems to me, well, it\u2019s kind of obvious and over the top.\u201d"

      "As part of the inaugural celebration, fans on the plaza Monday were given the opportunity to pose questions to some of the anchors: Savannah Guthrie, Craig Melvin, Sheinelle Jones, Carson Daly and Dylan Dreyer. And who better to moderate than Bravo host Andy Cohen?",
      "Here\u2019s what the TODAY anchors had been asked \u2014 and how they answered.",
      "For Savannah: Have Any Guests Made Her Starstruck?",

      "\u201cWhen Harrison Ford was on, I literally feel like the whole interview was me trying to flirt with him,\u201d she joked. \u201cHe was Han Solo! He is such a babe, and I just love him so much.\u201d",

      "\u201cProbably candle making,\u201d he revealed, much to the surprise of Cohen and the other anchors. \u201cI have found so much peace and solace over the last few years and, like, being in my garage pouring candles.\u201d",

      "She also revealed that she buys all her own clothes and repeats outfits as necessary. And even though it appears as though she and Craig coordinate their on-air outfits ahead of time, they don\u2019t. If they match, it\u2019s a coincidence.",
      "\u201cSometimes it just works out,\u201d said Savannah.",

      "If you\u2019ve ever been curious what the TODAY family is like while traveling, a Connecticut fan asked about the team\u2019s respective travel personalities.",

      "\u201cI said \u2018Leonardo Di-Crap-io.\u2019 And to this day, when I see Leonardo\u2019s name in the prompter, my heartbeat starts to go,\u201d Carson said.",
      "For Sheinelle: What Piece of Advice Did She Receive That She Still Keeps Today?",
      "During the 3rd Hour of TODAY, a fan asked Sheinelle about the best career advice she\u2019s ever received and still refers to today.",
      "Sheinelle said someone gave words of wisdom while she was interning during her sophomore year in college: \u201cAsk for what you want, take what you get, and use what you get to get what you want.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s true,\u201d Sheinelle added. \u201cSometimes you take jobs you don\u2019t necessarily want, but you just use it to get where you want and you just keep on climbing, my friend.\u201d",
      "According to Dylan, her best advice came when she first arrived at TODAY.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018You\u2019re not Al Roker, so don\u2019t try to be Al Roker,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut the moral of the story is to be yourself. We already have an Al, we need a Dylan. Be yourself.\u201d",

      "Vice President JD Vance stressed Wednesday that U.S. officials were not seeking to babysit the Gaza Strip ceasefire and that Israel was a partner, not a \u201cvassal state,\u201d as questions rose over the next steps in the Middle East.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has hosted a string of senior American officials in recent days, exchanged words of friendship and optimism with Vance at a joint news conference in Jerusalem as Washington worked to ensure the truce brokered by President Donald Trump will hold.",
      "\u201cI never said it was easy, but what I am is optimistic that the ceasefire is going to hold and that we can actually build a better future in the entire Middle East,\u201d Vance said, speaking alongside Netanyahu.",
      "The vice president\u2019s visit followed the arrival of Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was set to follow Thursday and meet with Netanyahu on Friday, the Israeli government said.",
      "The vice president and the Israeli leader championed each other\u2019s efforts in securing the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on Oct. 10.",
      "But as a succession of U.S. representatives flocked to Israel this week after flares of violence threatened to undermine the ceasefire, Vance also appeared to seek to reassure the Israeli leader \u2014 and the world \u2014 that the U.S. wasn\u2019t looking to overstep.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want a vassal state and that\u2019s not what Israel is. We don\u2019t want a client state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want a partnership.\u201d",
      "He later clarified the role of the Americans in Israel this week as the ceasefire looked fragile and the path to the second phase of the deal appeared uncertain.",
      "It wasn\u2019t about \u201cmonitoring in the sense of, you know, you monitor a toddler. It\u2019s about monitoring in the sense that there\u2019s a lot of work, a lot a good people who are doing that work and it\u2019s important for the principles of the administration to keep on ensuring that our people are doing what we need them to do,\u201d Vance said.",
      "The planned international security force in Gaza has loomed as a major question mark, with some in Israel concerned that such a force could limit its freedom to act in Gaza in the future.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that \u201cnumerous of our NOW GREAT ALLIES in the Middle East, and areas surrounding the Middle East,\u201d had \u201cexplicitly and strongly, with great enthusiasm, informed me that they would welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force.\u201d",
      "He added that he had \u201ctold these countries, and Israel, \u2018NOT YET,\u2019\u201d but he warned that if Hamas did not \u201cdo what is right,\u201d or it violated the ceasefire agreement, the militant group could meet a \u201cFAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL\u201d end.",
      "The president did not directly reference the international security force that he envisions entering Gaza to help maintain peace in the territory in the future under his 20-point plan, but appeared to be referring to the initiative.",
      "Vance had said Tuesday that the international stabilization force envisioned by the president was still in its early planning stages, as he acknowledged that coordinating troops from different countries could be a difficult task."

    "story": [
      "TOKYO \u2014 Lawmakers in Japan elected hard-line conservative Sanae Takaichi as prime minister Tuesday, making her the first woman in modern times to lead the key U.S. ally.",
      "Takaichi, 64, the new leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), was elected by lawmakers in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 237-149 over her closest rival, Yoshihiko Noda, leader of the liberal opposition Constitutional Democratic Party. She was also elected by upper house lawmakers in a second vote of 125-46 after falling one vote shy of a majority in the first round.",
      "Though her election is a milestone in a country where women are severely underrepresented in government, Takaichi enters office with a fragile coalition and facing a number of pressing challenges, including a visit next week by President Donald Trump.",
      "Takaichi, who says her hero is former British conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, has appointed two other women to her Cabinet, the same as the previous government. They include Satsuki Katayama, Japan\u2019s first female finance minister.",
      "\u201cI place great importance on equal opportunity, equal chances. And also participation from people from all walks of life,\u201d Takaichi said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cI formed my Cabinet with this idea in mind, bringing together the combined strength of all generations.\u201d",
      "But Takaichi\u2019s victory is not necessarily a victory for women in general, critics say, especially after she secured it by forming an alliance with an Osaka-based party that will pull her coalition even further to the right.",
      "\u201cOne would like to say this is a historic moment in Japan,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News. \u201cBut it\u2019s really hard to make that case, given her rather poor track record on empowering women.\u201d",
      "Takaichi opposes same-sex marriage and favors keeping succession to men only in Japan\u2019s shrinking imperial family. She also opposes changing the rules to make it easier for married women to keep their maiden names in Japan, where married couples are required to have the same surname.",
      "Progress toward gender equality has been slow in Japan, where women are far outnumbered at the highest levels of business and government and bear a disproportionate responsibility for child care and household chores.",
      "Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report. It noted that women make up less than 16% of Japanese lawmakers in the lower house of parliament and 10% of government ministers.",
      "After Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP earlier this month, Japanese feminist author Chizuko Ueno said that the prospect of Japan getting its first female prime minister \u201cdoesn\u2019t make me happy.\u201d",
      "Takaichi \u201csees herself as the Japanese version of Thatcher,\u201d Ueno, 77, said in a post on X. \u201cBritish feminists, who inherited Thatcher, have no illusions about women in leadership positions.\u201d",
      "She noted Takaichi\u2019s opposition to allowing separate surnames for married couples even as she has kept her own maiden name. Though Takaichi changed her legal name in 2004 when she first married Taku Yamamoto, she continued to use her maiden name professionally until they divorced in 2017, in line with legislation she had proposed.",
      "When they remarried in 2021, Yamamoto, a former LDP lawmaker, changed his legal surname to Takaichi.",
      "Takaichi \u2014 who in her youth rode motorcycles and played the drums in a heavy metal band \u2014 has pushed for greater support for women\u2019s health. She has talked about her personal struggles with symptoms of menopause and the importance of raising awareness \u201cso that men can properly understand when women are struggling, whether at school or in the workplace.\u201d",
      "But her campaign was focused mainly on the economy and national defense.",
      "Takaichi is a veteran politician who has served as minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality. A protege of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, she advocates tougher immigration policies, the revision of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution and higher defense spending.",
      "Japan\u2019s Nikkei stock exchange closed at an all-time high for the second day in a row Tuesday, on hopes that Takaichi\u2019s policies might help jumpstart the economy.",
      "Earlier this month Takaichi was elected leader of the LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since World War II, after running unsuccessfully in 2021 and 2024. In her victory speech, she underlined her commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cI myself will throw out the term \u2018work-life balance,\u2019\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cI will work and work and work and work and work.\u201d",
      "Her ascension to prime minister was thrown into doubt, however, after a crucial partner, the centrist party Komeito, left the LDP coalition.",
      "To ensure her victory, the LDP signed a deal Monday with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, a far-right party based in Osaka.",
      "Even with the alliance, Takaichi faces an uphill battle in parliament, where she falls short of a majority in both houses after the LDP suffered major losses in recent elections amid voter anger over party corruption scandals and the rising cost of living. Her premiership could thus end up being short-lived \u2014 much like that of her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, who was in office for a year.",
      "\u201cShe emerges from this a diminished leader from the get-go,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi also faces an early test next week with the arrival of Trump, who is making his first trip to Asia since returning to office. He is expected to visit Malaysia and Japan before continuing on to South Korea, which is hosting a major summit of Asia-Pacific economies.",
      "\u201cI will deepen the relationship of trust between us leaders through frank exchanges of views not only on bilateral issues but also on the challenges facing Japan and the United States, ranging from issues in the Indo-Pacific region to the situation in the Middle East, Europe, and Ukraine,\u201d Takaichi said at the news conference.",
      "But Kingston cautioned that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time to get ready for a slew of diplomatic activity,\u201d adding he thought \u201cjob one is the Japanese economy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 The heist cut through hushed corridors with a speed and ease that humiliated a nation. Authorities are now racing against their own clock.",
      "In the space of just seven minutes in the casual daylight of Sunday morning, four suspects stole nine pieces of France\u2019s crown jewels from the Louvre. They robbed not just the most visited museum in the world, but also the French people themselves, the government said Monday.",
      "Officials are now scrambling to reassure the public about security at key cultural sites \u2014 and find the jewels stolen from the museum before they can be broken up and melted down.",
      "The thieves used a monte-meubles \u2014 a truck mounted with a basket lift, commonly used to hoist furniture into Paris' inaccessible apartment blocks.",
      "They parked it outside the sprawling renaissance palace, rode to the balcony outside the Galerie d\u2019Apollon, and sliced through the window with cutting tools, according to officials.",
      "Their daring heist pierced the nation\u2019s self-image, too.",
      "Threatening museum staff with their angle-grinders, the otherwise unarmed thieves then smashed through two display cases, taking necklaces, tiaras and brooches from France\u2019s now dispatched royal families, officials said.",
      "This all played out just after the museum had opened, with bystanders able to video one suspect in a high-visibility vest standing at one of the glass boxes housing historical treasures.",
      "Investigators say they are puzzled why the culprits left behind the colossal, 140-carat Regent diamond, which has been valued at $60 million. Had they wandered down that opulent corridor, they would have reached the Mona Lisa \u2014 itself infamously stolen more than a century ago.",
      "As it was, they made off on two scooters, but not before they dropped two items, including the Crown of Empress Eug\u00e9nie, empress to Napoleon III in the 19th century, which was found broken near the scene, officials said.",
      "That item alone is \"worth several tens of millions of euros,\" Alexandre Giquello, president of France's leading Drouot auction house, told the Reuters news agency. \"And it's not, in my opinion, the most important item\" taken by the burglars.",
      "Some experts have said that because the items are unique they cannot be sold, and so the thieves will likely try to melt down their metals and break up their emeralds, sapphires, diamonds and pearls. That means investigators might have less than a week before the jewels are lost forever.",
      "The incident saw the Louvre shuttered Sunday and again Monday morning, with bewildered crowds evacuated from the area just after the assailants had struck.",
      "For a nation whose character is defined by proud displays of history and culture, the incident is being seen in some quarters as a national humiliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called it \u201can attack on a heritage that we cherish because it is our history.\u201d He vowed to \u201crecover the works and the perpetrators will be brought to justice,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything is being done, everywhere, to achieve this.\u201d",
      "The Culture and Interior ministries held an emergency meeting Monday and agreed to ask senior officials across France \u201cto immediately assess the existing security measures already in place around cultural institutions, and to strengthen them if necessary,\u201d the Interior Ministry said, according to Reuters.",
      "Justice Minister Gerard Darmanin said the heist gave a \u201cnegative\u201d and \u201cdeplorable\u201d image of France. \u201cWhat is certain is that we failed,\u201d he told the radio station France Inter. \u201cThe French people all feel like they\u2019ve been robbed.\u201d",
      "One of Macron\u2019s main political opponents, Jordan Bardella, the far-right leader who is favorite to replace him at the next presidential election in 2027, cast the crime as another example of \u201cthe disintegration of the state\u201d under Macron, and \u201can unbearable humiliation for our country.\u201d",
      "It is not the first time the Louvre has been targeted by thieves.",
      "In 1911, a museum decorator named Vincenzo Peruggia stole the Mona Lisa. And more recently French museums have been hit with a spate of thefts, including raw gold stolen from the National Museum of Natural History and porcelain works reportedly worth around $11 million taken from the Adrien Dubouche Museum in Limoges last month.",
      "After the theft at the Louvre, the union SUD Culture blamed \"destruction of jobs dedicated to security\" and funding shortfalls for security equipment.",
      "That hints at the wider disquiet percolating in France.",
      "Macron has seen multiple governments collapse as he tries to staunch the rise of Bardella\u2019s National Rally. Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest at public spending cuts.",
      "Now, authorities have another crisis at their door.",
      "Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on BFM TV that if the heist was commissioned by a collector, then there is a chance of getting the items back in their original condition.",
      "However, if not, the leading Dutch art detective Arthur Brand told Sky News that the police \"have a week\" before the jewels vanish forever.",
      "\"These crown jewels are so famous, you just cannot sell them,\" he said. \"The only thing they can do is melt the silver and gold down, dismantle the diamonds, try to cut them. That's the way they will probably disappear forever.\"",
      "\"It's a race against time.\"",

      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London earlier this week ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament currently taking place at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",

      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

Hovering over the news conference was a Tuesday morning Truth Social post by Trump, who wrote that Middle East allies \u201cwould welcome the opportunity, at my request, to go into GAZA with a heavy force and \u2018straighten [out] Hamas\u2019 if Hamas continues to act badly, in violation of their agreement with us.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is still hope that Hamas will do what is right,\u201d Trump added. \u201cIf they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL!\u201d",
      "Asked about the president\u2019s posture, Vance reinforced that \u201cvery bad things are going to happen\u201d and that Hamas would \u201cbe obliterated\u201d if it does not cooperate with terms of the ceasefire.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019m not going to do what the president of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it, because a lot of this stuff is difficult,\u201d Vance said. \u201cSo my point is, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually advisable for us to say this has to be done in a week, because a lot of this work is very hard.\u201d",
      "Vance added that he believed Middle East allies, including \u201cour Israeli friends,\u201d are showing a \u201ccertain amount of impatience with Hamas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re going to keep on working at this process,\u201d Vance said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to keep on trying to bring the deceased hostages home, but also make sure that all Gazans are able to live in a prosperous and safe place.\u201d",
      "Hamas returned the bodies of two more hostages via the Red Cross on Tuesday, according to the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "\u201cTwo coffins of deceased hostages, escorted by IDF troops, crossed the border into the State of Israel a short while ago and are on their way to the National Institute for Forensic Medicine, where identification procedures will be carried out,\u201d the IDF said on X.",
      "If the bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday are confirmed to be  hostages, then the bodies of 13 deceased hostages still remain in Gaza.",
      "Vance was joined Tuesday by Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, and Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law. Both played key roles in negotiating the ceasefire, while Vance has been dispatched to demonstrate the administration\u2019s commitment to it.",
      "\u201cI want to echo what the vice president said about how a lot of people are getting a little hysterical about different incursions one way or the other,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cBut what we are seeing is that things are going in accordance \u2026 both sides are transitioning from two years of very intense warfare to now a peacetime posture.\u201d",
      "Vance described his visit in part as a fact-finding mission that will help inform the U.S. continued role in the process rather than a reaction to the recent violence that has erupted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to read about it, it\u2019s one thing to talk with Jared and Steve on the phone about what\u2019s going on on the ground,\u201d the vice president said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing to actually shake somebody\u2019s hand, to look them in the eye and to understand what are the challenges, what are the things they need from me.\u201d"

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hamas has violently sought to reassert its authority over the Gaza Strip in the wake of the Israel military\u2019s partial withdrawal, but questions remain over the group\u2019s future and efforts to rebuild.",
      "Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, the militant group has deployed armed police officers on streets from where Israeli forces have withdrawn, clashed with rival clans, directly fired upon and killed Israeli troops in multiple incidents, and staged at least one public execution of suspected collaborators.",
      "As Hamas continues to demonstrate its presence, Israeli security officials and experts on Gaza agree it has been badly diminished but not thoroughly destroyed, and will count on new recruits propelled to join after tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians were killed by Israeli fire.",
      "Assessments of Hamas\u2019 strength are crucial to the negotiations around the group\u2019s disarmament \u2014 an important stipulation in the American-brokered ceasefire deal that halted the war. So far, the group has refused to give up its weapons.",
      "\u201cHamas was damaged very severely in its military capabilities, but I think it will be fair to say that it wasn\u2019t crushed,\u201d said Shalom Ben Hanan, a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at Israel\u2019s Reichman University and a nearly 30-year veteran of the Israeli Security Agency, also known as Shabak or Shin Bet. \u201cMaybe the threat isn\u2019t in the days to come or the nearest future. But their potential is still there.\u201d",
      "Hanan said the group still commands about 15,000 to 25,000 fighters \u2014 an estimate he said was based on his regular briefings from serving Israeli security officials.",
      "According to an Israeli military official, who asked for anonymity to speak openly about the Israeli military\u2019s internal assessment, about 10,000 to 20,000 commandos remain at Hamas\u2019 disposal.",
      "Giora Eiland, the former director of Israel\u2019s National Security Council and the former head of the planning department of the Israel Defense Forces, said Hamas lost about 20,000 fighters during two years of war \u2014 an estimate he also bases on conversations with serving security officials.",
      "But the group will have little trouble reconstituting its manpower, Eiland said, and security officials believe Hamas has been recruiting new fighters throughout the war even under fire.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for Hamas to regain power and it is very easy for them to recruit more and more people to replace those who were killed,\u201d Eiland said.",
      "Hamas wrested power from the more secular and internationally recognized Fatah party in 2007 after winning legislative elections the previous year. The Islamist group, which the United States, Israel and many other countries classify as a terrorist group, does not recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist and launched the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in part to stall normalization efforts in the Arab world.",
      "Israel\u2019s ensuing offensive has flattened much of the enclave, killed tens of thousands of civilians and engendered the kind of anger that could create thousands of potential recruits.",
      "\u201cAlthough we will be speaking about young people with less military experience, they still have no doubt lots of competence and enough personal weapons like small arms and RPGs,\u201d Eiland said, referring to rocket-propelled grenades.",
      "Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been killed and maimed in the war; a United Nations commission said in September that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Famine was officially declared in August in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger. The war has also inflicted significant damage on Hamas\u2019 supplies of its heaviest weapons and its weapons manufacturing capabilities, as well as on its senior leadership.",
      "The Israeli military official said that as many as 90% of the group\u2019s rockets have been destroyed, and Israel has succeeded in frustrating Hamas\u2019 ability to rebuild that lost heavy firepower.",
      "\u201cVery important is the manufacturing sites, the smuggling routes and so on,\u201d the military official said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just taking away the fish, it\u2019s taking away the rod.\u201d",
      "All of the experts agreed that Hamas\u2019 vast tunnel system remains its greatest strength and Israel\u2019s greatest challenge.",
      "Eiland estimated that 70% to 80% of Hamas\u2019 tunnels remain intact, with much of the surviving network unknown to Israel\u2019s military.",
      "In a statement last week, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the IDF would turn its attention to destroying the remaining tunnel network as part of the process of disarming Hamas. The IDF said it had been working to dismantle a part of the tunnel network when some of its soldiers came under fire Sunday.",
      "The group\u2019s political power and popularity \u2014 key components in its ability to recruit, rebuild its weapons and suppress its rivals \u2014 have been badly damaged. Even if Gazans are enraged at Israel for killing nearly 70,000 Palestinians during the war, Hamas still takes part of the public blame.",
      "\u201cPolitically is where Hamas is really in shambles,\u201d said Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, head of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Realign for Palestine project, whose family is from the Gaza Strip. \u201cThey don\u2019t really have a political program. They don\u2019t really have a compelling agenda in Gaza.\u201d",
      "But unlike the Islamic State terrorist group, or ISIS, and Al Qaeda \u2014 two terror groups whose power has been checked by the U.S.-led war on terror over the past quarter-century \u2014 Hamas presides over a true geographic constituency.",
      "\u201cIt is not a terrorist organization that came from nowhere and managed to take control over a certain area by spreading fear and terror,\u201d Eiland said. \u201cHamas is the authentic representative of the people of Gaza.\u201d",
      "Outside Gaza, Hamas also takes credit for turning global opinion against Israel, Alkhatib said.",
      "\u201cHamas feels that this shift is something that they alone brought about,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Hamas ties that to its strategic picture on the ground.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince Andrew may have given up his titles, but the questions about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein haven\u2019t given up on him \u2014 or Britain\u2019s embattled royal family.",
      "Seemingly every day, damaging new reports emerge about Andrew, 65, his friendship with the late pedophile financier, and allegations the prince had sex with trafficked Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre when she was 17, which he denies.",
      "In her posthumous memoir, \u201cNobody\u2019s Girl,\u201d released Tuesday, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April at age 41, said Andrew acted as though having sex with her \u201cwas his birthright.\u201d",
      "Andrew, who in February 2022 reached a legal settlement with Giuffre after she filed a civil case against him in a New York court, has repeatedly denied having met her.",
      "But the rolling scandal refuses to go away, and it has the potential to inflict further damage on a monarchy whose popularity continues to dwindle after the death of the widely beloved Queen Elizabeth II in 2022.",
      "King Charles III has sought to insulate \u201cthe Firm\u201d from the cloud over his younger brother. Andrew said in a statement last week that with Charles\u2019 \u201cagreement,\u201d he would \"no longer use my title or the honours which have been conferred upon me,\u201d including Duke of York.",
      "But there are still unanswered questions about what the palace knew, and when, with calls from lawmakers and others for the royals to oust Andrew entirely.",
      "\u201cThe deep and wide support for the queen meant the family was able to better weather all the controversies that could emerge \u2014 and this is a bad one,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London and specializes on the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "\u201cThese specific allegations are, of course, extraordinarily damaging in the first place, but they also run counter to some of the causes that members of the royal family take up,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's agreement for Andrew to relinquish his titles came after emails published in documents for a court case not involving the prince showed he had been in contact with Epstein for longer than he previously admitted.",
      "That \u201cmakes him look, in black and white, a liar,\u201d NBC News' royal contributor Daisy McAndrew told \u201cTODAY\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd so how can you trust anything else he says?\u201d",
      "Then Sunday, London\u2019s Metropolitan Police said it was investigating reports that Andrew had asked one of its officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. A Buckingham Palace official told NBC News these reports should be \u201cexamined in the appropriate way.\u201d",
      "Monday brought two further revelations: First that Andrew had not paid rent on his Royal Lodge residence for 20 years, revealed in a Freedom of Information request by The Times newspaper to the Crown Estate, which handles royal finances. Neither Andrew nor Buckingham Palace have responded to the report.",
      "Then came the publication of Giuffre\u2019s posthumous memoir.",
      "She wrote that she had sex with the prince on three occasions, including an \u201corgy\u201d involving \u201ceight other young girls\u201d who \u201cappeared to be under the age of 18 and didn\u2019t really speak English.\u201d",
      "She then suffered three weeks of \u201cirregular bleeding,\u201d before waking up in a \u201cpool of blood\u201d and being taken to hospital by Epstein, she wrote.",
      "Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 shortly after he was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, later told her she had suffered a miscarriage, and she suspected him of conspiring with the doctor to keep it quiet, Giuffre said.",
      "On seeing a photo of Andrew and Epstein walking in New York's Central Park in 2010 \u2014 after Epstein was convicted of soliciting prostitution of someone under the age of 18 \u2014 Giuffre wrote she was \u201crevolted to see two of my abusers together, out for a stroll.\u201d But \"mostly I was amazed that a member of the Royal Family would be stupid enough to appear in public with Epstein.\u201d",
      "Andrew has previously denied these allegations, saying that he has \u201cno recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d In his statement announcing the relinquishment of his titles, he said, \u201cI vigorously deny the accusations against me.\u201d",
      "The civil sex abuse lawsuit brought by Giuffre against Andrew was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Though Buckingham Palace routinely says it does not speak for the prince, Andrew has enjoyed a prominent role at some recent royal events, including the queen's funeral.",
      "Some lawmakers are demanding that Andrew be formally stripped of his titles by an act of Parliament \u2014 a rare foray into regal matters by Britain\u2019s supposedly separate government.",
      "The last time this happened was in 1917, when Parliament used the Titles Deprivation Act to strip German members of the British royal family of their titles during World War I.",
      "That\u2019s not without risks, according to Prescott at Royal Holloway.",
      "\"If you have legislation removing the dukedom from Prince Andrew, might a cheeky MP want to table an amendment and remove the dukedom of Sussex from Prince Harry?\u201d he said.",
      "The government indicated it does not support this. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said Monday that while \u201cour thoughts have to be with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, these \u201care matters for the royal family.\u201d",
      "The nuclear option would involve the king himself using something called \u201cLetters Patent\u201d to strip Andrew of his designation as prince.",
      "In doing so, the palace must weigh distancing itself from Andrew with ensuring the blowback from any further censure does not do even more damage to an institution that requires public buy-in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that the monarchy isn\u2019t voted in,\u201d Prescott said. \u201cBut if the public mood shifted and people no longer wanted to have the monarchy, then you imagine that politics would follow.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A large chunk of suspected space debris has been found in a remote part of the Australian desert, the country\u2019s space agency confirmed Monday.",
      "The charred and smoldering object was found in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, according to the Australian Space Agency. It\u2019s not yet clear what the object is or where it came from, but officials said it\u2019s probably a spent rocket part.",
      "\u201cThe debris is likely a propellant tank or pressure vessel from a space launch vehicle,\u201d the Australian Space Agency wrote in a post on X.",
      "The agency did not provide details about the object\u2019s size or weight, but wrote that it is working with local authorities and other space agencies to investigate and determine \u201cthe exact nature of the debris and its origin.\u201d",
      "The agency did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for further information.",
      "The object was discovered Saturday on a remote access road by workers from a nearby mine, according to a report from Sky News, which said that local authorities did not think the debris posed any threat to public safety. NBC News has not independently confirmed these details. (Sky News is a division of Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "Government space agencies and private space companies often let depleted or defunct rocket parts and satellites burn up in the atmosphere as a way to destroy them. Sometimes, however, pieces can survive the fiery process of atmospheric re-entry. Still, it\u2019s relatively rare for space debris to fall over land, given that the planet is mostly covered by oceans \u2014 and even more rare for pieces to fall over densely populated areas.",
      "In recent years, though, experts have raised concerns about the growing problem of space debris, particularly as launches into orbit have become more frequent.",
      "Last summer, a 90-pound slab of space debris was discovered on a mountain trail in North Carolina. It was later identified as part of the service module from a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that had carried four astronauts back to Earth from the International Space Station earlier that year.",
      "In March 2024, a 1.6-pound piece of metal tore through a home in Naples, Florida. A subsequent investigation found that the metal debris came from a cargo pallet that had been intentionally released from the International Space Station to burn up in the atmosphere.",
      "Tens of thousands of pieces of space junk \u2014 and millions more smaller bits of orbital debris \u2014 are cluttered in low Earth orbit, the narrow band of space where many telecommunications and GPS satellites circle the planet. These objects fly through orbit at up to 18,000 mph, threatening functioning spacecraft and posing safety risks to astronauts on the International Space Station.",
      "For those reasons, experts have long warned against overcrowding in space. NASA and other space agencies have even funded research into and technology demonstrations of how to clean up the large amount of junk in orbit.",
      "The Australian Space Agency said on X that it \u201cis committed to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, including debris mitigation and continues to highlight this on the international stage.\u201d"

      "People with a leading cause of blindness were able to read again thanks to a tiny wireless chip implanted in the back of the eye and specialized augmented glasses, according to study results published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "The trial involved 38 European patients, all of whom had an advanced stage of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) known as geographic atrophy.",
      "There is no cure for AMD, which is driven by changes in a part of the retina called the macula and caused by inflammation and a build-up of waste. The photoreceptor cells in the macula are responsible for producing sharp, detailed and colored vision. When the disease has progressed to the geographic atrophy stage, the cells deteriorate and die, and people lose their central vision \u2014 meaning an object straight ahead may appear blurry or covered up with a dark blotch.",
      "Roughly 22 million people in the United States have AMD, and about 1 million have geographic atrophy, according to the American Macular Degeneration Foundation.",
      "In the study, the participants, who had an average age of 79, were fitted with the \u201cPRIMA device,\u201d a system meant to replicate vision. Patients wear augmented reality glasses embedded with a camera that captures their visual field. What the camera \u201csees\u201d is transmitted to the chip implanted in the eye in the form of infrared light. The chip converts the light into an electrical current, which stimulates the remaining healthy cells in the macula in a realistic way, enabling the brain to interpret signals the cells send as vision.",
      "An image processor, which users must carry, lets patients zoom in and magnify the images they see, which appear in black and white.",
      "With the help of the PRIMA device, 80% of the 32 patients who returned for reassessments one year after the chip implantation had achieved clinically meaningful visual improvements. Patients did experience side effects, predominantly related to the surgical procedure: The study reported that 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 of the patients, ranging from elevated blood pressure in the eye to an accumulation of blood around the retina. The majority of the adverse events resolved within two months of the implantation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first ever therapeutic approach that has led to an improvement in visual function in this group of patients,\u201d said Dr. Frank Holz, the trial\u2019s lead investigator and chair of the department of ophthalmology at the University Hospital of Bonn in Germany. \u201cLate-stage age-related macular degeneration is a dismal disease. Patients are no longer capable of reading, driving a car, watching TV or even recognizing faces. So [these results] are a game changer in my mind.\u201d",
      "One patient, Sheila Irvine, 70, who was fitted with the PRIMA device at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, said in a statement provided by the hospital that her life before she received the implant was akin to \u201chaving two black discs in my eyes, with the outside distorted.\u201d A self-described \u201cavid bookworm\u201d before she lost her vision, Irvine said she was now able to do crosswords and read prescriptions.",
      "Dr. Sunir Garg, professor of ophthalmology at the retina service of Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the study, said the results are a breakthrough for patients with geographic atrophy. All doctors have been able to offer, he said, are visual aids, like magnifiers, and emotional support.",
      "\u201cEven with new medical therapies, the best that we can do is slow it down,\u201d said Garg, who works with several drugmakers involved in treatments for AMD, including Apellis Pharmaceuticals, the maker of pegcetacoplan. The drug, which slows the progression of geographic atrophy, was recently approved in the United States and must be injected into the eye every one to two months. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop it, and we can\u2019t do anything to bring back lost vision.\u201d",
      "Dr. Demetrios Vavvas, director of the retina service at Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, who was also not involved in the study, said the PRIMA system is not without limitations.",
      "Vavvas noted that the surgery required to implant the chip in the eye requires a high level of surgical skill and is not without risk. \u201cYou have to lift the retina off its normal position to implant this device, which increases the atrophy,\u201d said Vavvas, who is a consultant to Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals, a company working on stem cell therapies for patients with other forms of vision loss.",
      "Vavvas said it was important to note that the device is not restoring normal vision, as patients were able to see only in black and white rather than color, and that the trial participants had to undergo a significant amount of training to learn how to see with the device. He also said it was not clear whether the enhancements in visual ability had significantly improved the patients\u2019 quality of life.",
      "But at the same time, Vavvas was also optimistic about its potential, describing the current iteration of PRIMA as a key steppingstone in the field of vision restoration.",
      "\u201cThink of this device as the pre-release iPhone,\u201d he said. \u201cThe limitations are clear. We shouldn\u2019t oversell that the quality of life really improved. But there were certain [visual] tasks at which the patients were clearly better. So it shows to us that there is potential in this approach. It is still, in some ways, a prototype. They\u2019re working on iterations of this device that will be better.\u201d",
      "New upgrades to the device could be coming in the next couple of years.",
      "The PRIMA system was invented by Stanford University ophthalmology professor Daniel Palanker and is being developed by the California-based neural engineering company Science Corp.",
      "Palanker said technical improvements are being made to increase the number of pixels in the chip from 400 to 10,000. The new chips have already been tested in rats, and the upgraded chips are being manufactured for future human trials. With the aid of the camera\u2019s zoom function, Palanker said, that could theoretically enable patients to achieve 20/20 visual resolution.",
      "\u201cWe are also working on next-generation software that will allow patients to perceive not just black-and-white text, but also gray-scale natural images, such as faces,\u201d Palanker said.",
      "Palanker suggested that the technology could be trialed in other retinal diseases that cause blindness, such as Stargardt disease, which has similar symptoms to age-related macular degeneration but is genetic and usually affects younger people.",
      "Garg and Vavvas are eager to see larger trials that provide more details about how the device improves patients\u2019 ability to function day to day. Vavvas suggested that future trials should include a control arm to understand the extent to which the device yields real-world benefits, for example compared with existing electronic magnifiers.",
      "\u201cIs it something that is good enough for patients to say, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve regained my independence because I can now do my credit card bills myself, stamp and address my envelopes myself, and look at grocery store labels\u2019?\u201d Garg said. \u201cThose kinds of practical things I would like to know more about.\u201d",
      "Vavvas  said: \u201cThis is a chronic disease that you will have for life, so we need more than one year of follow-up to see other risks, other problems. Does that signal of efficacy that we see at 12 months remain two years later?\u201d",
      "While Vavvas said he would not call the device a panacea for blindness, the study showed that brain-computer interfaces can represent an important approach to tackling different kinds of severe visual impairment. \u201cAs the iterations of this device become better and better, it could become a real solution for a cohort of patients,\u201d he said."

      "President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement at the White House on Monday on rare-earth minerals, which could serve as a bargaining chip as the United States fights a trade war with China.",
      "They signed the agreement at the top of the meeting, which Trump told the media had \"been negotiated over a period of four or five months.\"",
      "\"We got it done just in time for the visit,\" Trump told reporters. \"And we work together very much on rare earths, critical minerals and lots of other things, and we\u2019ve had a very good relationship. We\u2019ve been working on that for quite a while.\"",
      "Albanese said Australia has a $8.5 billion pipeline \"ready to go\" for the deal.",
      "A White House official said that under the deal, the U.S. and Australian governments plan to invest more than $3 billion together in critical mineral projects in the next six months, with recoverable resources estimated to be worth over $50 billion.",
      "Asked whether the United States plans to lift tariffs on Australia, Trump touted his general trade policies and eventually said: \"I will say this, Australia pays very low tariffs, very, very low tariffs. Australia pays among the lowest tariffs.\"",
      "The two leaders are also expected to discuss defense cooperation, Indo-Pacific stability and the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, Albanese\u2019s office said Sunday.",
      "Albanese, whose center-left government was re-elected in May for a second term, said he looked forward to a \u201cpositive and constructive\u201d meeting with Trump.",
      "Australia, a country of about 27 million people, hasn\u2019t figured prominently in the second Trump administration so far. Unlike many U.S. trading partners, it has a large trade deficit with the United States, earning it the minimum tariff rate of 10%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Australia is particularly high on Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d said Emma Shortis, director of the Australia Institute\u2019s International and Security Affairs Program.",
      "But the rest of the world may be watching the meeting closely, she said, \u201cto see how Trump treats a traditional ally.\u201d",
      "For Albanese, the bar for success is that the meeting \u201cisn\u2019t a disaster,\u201d Shortis said, avoiding the kind of Oval Office dressing-downs Trump delivered to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.",
      "Resource-rich Australia has sensed an opportunity in recent U.S.-China tensions over rare-earth minerals, which are critical components of advanced electronics and defense technologies. China, which has a near-monopoly on their production and processing, has announced a series of export controls viewed as threatening the global supply.",
      "\u201cWe know that American companies desperately need critical minerals, and Australia is very well placed to service that need,\u201d Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Washington on Friday.",
      "There has been some uneasiness in Australia that it has taken nine months for Trump and Albanese to have an official meeting, though they met briefly last month on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "But there is also uneasiness about Albanese\u2019s meeting with Trump at all.",
      "Australia, whose population closely follows U.S. politics, is among the countries most critical of Trump, with 77% of survey respondents telling the Pew Research Center in the first months of his current term that they had \u201cno confidence\u201d in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs.",
      "A poll released by the Australia Institute in May found that more than 54% of respondents preferred a more independent foreign policy over a closer alliance with the United States, an increase of 10 percentage points compared with the same poll two months earlier, shortly after Trump returned to office.",
      "Though Australian support for the U.S. alliance has historically been strong, \u201cif the United States is not seen as a democracy or a nation of laws, then the alliance with the United States will come into question,\u201d said Brendon O\u2019Connor, a professor of U.S. politics and U.S. foreign relations at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.",
      "Albanese broke with the United States last month by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. He has praised Trump over the ceasefire he brokered in the Israel-Hamas war but will be cautious not to be seen as too \u201cfawning\u201d to Trump on \u201cissues around democracy and authoritarianism and internal dissent,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.",
      "The relationship has also been tested over the future of AUKUS (which stands for Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States), a $240 billion trilateral security deal in which Australia would buy U.S. nuclear-powered submarines in 2032 and then build a new submarine class with Britain.",
      "Australian officials have expressed confidence that the deal will move forward, even though it is currently under review by the Trump administration amid concerns that the U.S. may not be able to produce enough submarines for both itself and its ally.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Pat Conroy said last week that Australia would \u201cshortly\u201d make its second of three billion-dollar payments to help accelerate U.S. nuclear submarine production.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s reasons to be pretty skeptical about whether those submarines will ever arrive,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just up to Trump. I mean, six months before delivering them in the 2030s the United States can decide it doesn\u2019t have enough submarines to sell Australia three or four.\u201d",
      "Some in Australia have suggested that Albanese could shore up Trump\u2019s support for AUKUS by offering a critical minerals deal.",
      "Shortis was skeptical, arguing that \u201cTrump\u2019s word on any issue like this is not particularly reliable and can change very quickly.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Iranian director Jafar Panahi puts a lot on the line for his work.",
      "Authorities could again arrest him for speaking out against the country\u2019s hard-line regime. They could send him back to the notoriously cruel Evin Prison in Tehran, which houses many of Iran\u2019s political dissidents. He could again be placed on house arrest and barred from making films.",
      "But Panahi, now 65, has largely ignored these attempts at silencing him over the years, instead focusing on doing what he loves most: making films about his homeland.",
      "When he was imprisoned and charged with \u201cpropagandizing against the government,\u201d he went on a hunger strike until authorities released him on bail. His filmmaking ban \u2014 which was supposed to last for 20 years \u2014 ended up serving as creative inspiration, fueling critically acclaimed films such as \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d and \u201cTaxi.\u201d",
      "With his latest movie, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was released in limited North American theaters over the weekend, Panahi once again defied the government\u2019s attempts to censor his art, though it has meant putting himself at risk.",
      "\u201cYou have to find a way around the system,\u201d Panahi said in a recent interview conducted in Farsi at a hotel in Santa Monica, California, and translated into English by NBC News. Panahi, known for the signature sunglasses that he sports at every event, was sitting in the lobby next to his translator after enjoying a smoke break outside.",
      "The filmmaker has had a busy few months traveling the world to promote his film, a buzzy Oscar contender that was picked up for distribution in North America by Neon. He has also faced several hurdles coming from Iran \u2014 including missing a New York Film Festival screening after his visa process was delayed, reportedly because of the U.S. government shutdown.",
      "While on the press tour, he has continued to champion his message of the importance of freedom of expression.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d a revenge drama that is sprinkled with comedic moments, follows a group of Iranians who capture a man whom they suspect was their interrogator while they were in prison. They quarrel about the man they have put in the back of their van and whether he is in fact the guard, noting both have an artificial leg that makes a squeaking noise when walking. The group also grapples with the morality behind taking vengeance, and whether that makes them just as bad as those who oppressed them.",
      "Panahi reflected on how his own time in prison shaped \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which was the first film he directed after  spending seven months in Evin from 2022 to 2023.",
      "\u201cWhen you are imprisoned, it does not matter which group, which category and which party you are. We are all living with each other. And then when you go out, you can\u2019t separate from it. These all remain in your mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience stays in your brain, and after you leave \u2026 you feel like you have to do something to express this.\u201d",
      "The filmmaker has previously spoken about his time at the prison, recalling how he was placed in solitary confinement and blindfolded during his hourslong interrogations. He drew from his own experiences, as well as from fellow political prisoners he met there, in writing the film, making it one of his most personal endeavors to date.",
      "But authorities in Iran oversee the media, so filmmakers must get their scripts approved to get film permits. While Panahi is no longer banned from filmmaking, he chose to shoot in secret, filming in Iran over the course of several weeks without official permission from the government because of the film\u2019s sensitive subject matter.",
      "The crew shot scenes in a remote desert location, in a van and in the streets of Tehran. Expecting trouble from authorities, the crew also took precautionary steps while moving around the city. Panahi told Vulture that in the summer of 2024, the crew was stopped by police during filming. They were asked to turn everything over but they handed over an empty memory card from a camera, rather than the actual footage of the film.",
      "They then waited a few weeks to resume the project and ended up editing part of the movie in France for safety reasons after the cast and crew had a run-in with authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make a movie in Iran, you have to accept that is not possible through a regular path, you have to find an alternative path, and you either have to find it yourself or use other people\u2019s experience in doing so,\u201d Panahi said.",
      "Despite his years of political dissent and the personal price he has paid, Panahi is humble. He explained that it\u2019s the people of Iran who deserve praise for continuing to stand up to the government in the aftermath of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody, which triggered huge, monthslong public protests that were labeled the Women, Life, Freedom movement.",
      "\u201cThey are more brave than I am,\u201d he said, noting that he\u2019s someone who is \u201cwell known\u201d and because of that has \u201csome protections in place.\u201d The activists \u201care not known to anyone,\u201d he said. They took to the streets, were jailed and released, and still continue to protest in their own ways.",
      "For example, there are women in Iran who now refuse to wear the mandatory hijab, instead walking around with their hair flowing freely. It\u2019s a subtle act of defiance that Panahi captured in his film, which shows its two female stars without headscarves in public in several scenes.",
      "It was important to Panahi to depict a \u201ctruthful picture of Iran,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in history where everything is measured by whether it happened before or after the Women, Life, Freedom movement. If it\u2019s before, and you were showing in your film that there was a woman without the headscarf covering, it would not be believable.\u201d",
      "Those who admire Panahi say his art serves as its own powerful form of activism, as he balances politics with a personal touch that helps breathe levity into heavier topics.",
      "At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Panahi won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or after the film received a nearly eight-minute standing ovation.",
      "The win marked the second time an Iranian filmmaker took home the award (Abbas Kiarostami was the first, winning in 1997 for \u201cTaste of Cherry\u201d). Panahi has now received the top prize at all three major European film festivals, including Berlin\u2019s Golden Bear for \u201cTaxi\u201d in 2015 and the Golden Lion at Venice for \u201cThe Circle\u201d in 2000.",
      "Oscar-winning actor Juliette Binoche, who served as the 2025 Cannes jury president, said that \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d \u201csprings from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very human and political at the same time, because he comes from a complicated country,\u201d she said at the event, according to Deadline. \u201cWhen we watched the film, it stood out.\u201d",
      "At the New York Film Festival earlier this month, Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese also praised Panahi and called on more streaming services to champion Iranian cinema.",
      "As the film continues to rack up positive reviews and vies for Oscar nods, Panahi plans to continue to promote it at events.",
      "Other Iranian filmmakers, including Panahi\u2019s friend and fellow director Mohammad Rasoulof, have fled Iran to avoid facing fierce punishment.",
      "But when asked whether he fears the Iranian government lashing out at him again, Panahi appeared undeterred.",
      "\u201cWhat are they going to do that they haven\u2019t done already?\u201d he said."

      "Armed with power tools, a crane lift and a plan straight out of a heist movie, four thieves broke into the Louvre on Sunday and made off with royal jewels once worn by France\u2019s queens and empresses, officials told NBC News.",
      "The group used power tools to shatter display cases, threatened guards and fled on scooters \u2014 leaving behind a trail of clues, including Empress Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s crown, apparently dropped during the escape.",
      "The Ministry of Culture confirmed the jewels stolen include a necklace and a pair of earrings from the Marie-Louise collection; a necklace, earrings and tiara from from the Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Queen Hortense collection; and a brooch, bodice bow and a tiara from the collection of Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Investigators said they found two of the stolen pieces, including Eug\u00e9nie\u2019s crown, near the scene, suggesting the thieves lost them while fleeing.",
      "A brazen daytime heist",
      "The break-in happened at around 9:30 a.m. local time as the museum was opening, French Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez told radio station France Inter. Two people, with their faces concealed, used power tools to break into the Galerie d\u2019Apollon through a window, the prosecutor's office said. The crew had brought a crane lift mounted on a truck and appeared to have scouted the location in advance.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez said the \u201cexperienced\u201d thieves broke into the gallery with a disc cutter. The stolen jewels had been kept behind glass inside the gallery, he added. The daring morning heist, which lasted just seven minutes, forced the museum to close for the day, officials said.",
      "The break-in triggered alarms on the exterior of the window of the Galerie d\u2019Apollon and on the two high-security display cabinets targeted by the thieves inside the gallery, the Ministry of Culture in Paris said Sunday, describing the brazen theft as \u201cparticularly rapid and brutal.\u201d",
      "Five museum workers were in the room and adjacent rooms and immediately contacted police, the culture ministry said.",
      "The thieves targeted two glass display cabinets housing \u201cpriceless\u201d jewels and threatened guards, who evacuated the premises, the prosecutor\u2019s office said.",
      "The Ministry of Culture credited the quick-thinking employees and their calls to police with prompting the thieves to flee, leaving behind their equipment and some of the stolen items.",
      "Before fleeing the scene, the thieves allegedly attempted to set fire to the crane lift they had used, the prosecutor's office said. A museum worker thwarted that attempt, the culture ministry said.",
      "An image from the scene showed what appeared to be a furniture elevator propped up against a balcony, with police gathered nearby to cordon off the area.",

      "A recent string of heists",
      "The Galerie d\u2019Apollon \u2014 or Apollo Gallery \u2014 is home to many of France\u2019s crown jewels and historic diamonds. It also features hard-stone vessels collected by French kings, including jade and rock crystal, according to the Louvre\u2019s website.",
      "Nu\u00f1ez said \u200bthe museum was evacuated \u201cmainly to preserve evidence and clues so that investigators could work undisturbed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI expect we will very soon find the thieves and jewels,\u201d he added.",
      "An investigation into organized theft and criminal conspiracy to commit crime has been launched by the Paris public prosecutor\u2019s office, a source inside the office told NBC News."
