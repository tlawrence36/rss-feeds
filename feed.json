      "The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction have filed dueling lawsuits after an onstage scuffle last year prompted the cancellation of the band's tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell's onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, prompting the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",

      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",

But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",

The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",

      "Romance novels aren't just guilty pleasures anymore",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Romance novels have always spiced up quiet nights. Now, a genre that has sometimes been dismissed as a guilty pleasure is bringing readers and writers together through social media, book clubs and a growing number of romance-specific bookstores.",
      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",
      "Dahlia likened romance readers to \u201cComic-Con folks,\u201d referring to the deep-rooted passion that defines comic-book fandom.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re educated on the genre in a real way,\u201d Dahlia said. \u201cMany of them started reading romance \u2014 Danielle Steel, V.C. Andrews, Jude Deveraux \u2014 as teenagers.\u201d",
      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",
      "\"Now they\u2019re loving seeing how widely accepted romance has become.\u201d",
      "Bookstores like Lovestruck and The Ripped Bodice (which has a flagship store in Los Angeles) have begun popping up all over the U.S., from Wichita, Kansas, to Wilmington, North Carolina, to Hopkinsville, Kentucky.",
      "Of the 157 romance-dedicated bookstores in the American Booksellers Association, more than half opened within the last two years, said Allison Hill, CEO of the trade group for independent sellers.",
      "\u201cRomance books have been one of the fastest growing book sales categories in recent years, driven by a number of factors including the need for escape reading and BookTok,\u201d Hill said.",
      "And the genre has evolved. \u201cThe romance genre is more diverse in every way including character identity and plot,\u201d she said.",
      "Lovestruck's owner, Rachel Kanter, called the boom \u201cincredible \u2014 and honestly, overdue. Romance has always been one of the most commercially successful genres, but for a long time it didn\u2019t get the respect or space it deserved in the literary world.\u201d",
      "Romance-specific bookstores, she says, \"are places where readers can feel joy, comfort, and connection \u2014 and where love is taken seriously as a literary theme.\u201d",
      "As with many hobbies, romance fandom solidified and expanded after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets. But a common theme is their \u201cinherently hopeful storylines,\u201d says Elizabeth Michaelson Monaghan, a 52-year-old freelance writer and editor in New York who said she\u2019s read \u201chundreds\u201d of romance novels.",
      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing culture of (mostly) women reading and sharing these books across generations.",
      "\u201cIt is pleasurable to reimagine courtship or the romantic bond,\u201d said Jayashree Kamble, professor of English at LaGuardia Community College and president of the International Association for the Study of Popular Romance. \u201cThere is limited risk involved.\u201d",
      "Kamble has been a voracious romance reader since her teenage years in India, where she devoured Harlequin romances.",
      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",
      "\u201cI can go to a bookstore and not just find people who love books,\u201d she said, \u201cbut find people who love the very same books I love.\u201d",
      "As Annabel Monaghan, author of several love stories including \u201cNora Goes Off Script,\u201d puts it, \u201cPeople who read romance want to feel good. And when you gather a bunch of people who want to feel good, it\u2019s magic.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",

      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny\u2019s latest album, \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d is sparking global conversations about Puerto Rico\u2019s culture and struggles",
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",

    "story": [
      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",
      "If alternatives pan out, \u201cI absolutely think that cardiac programs will be thrilled, especially at hospitals that have rejected NRP.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "As a presidential candidate, Kennedy discussed how his son and several close friends benefited from using psychedelics to deal with grief and other issues.",
      "A number of veterans lobbying for psychedelic access have already met with Trump's Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing so far is positive,\u201d Collins told House lawmakers in May.",
      "But some experts worry the hope and hype surrounding psychedelics has gotten ahead of the science.",
      "Philip Corlett, a psychiatric researcher at Yale University, says bypassing rigorous clinical trials could set back the field and jeopardize patients.",
      "\"If RFK and the new administration are serious about this work, there are things they could do to shepherd it into reality by meeting the benchmarks of medical science,\" Corlett said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d",
      "As officials in Washington weigh the future of psychedelics, some states are moving ahead with their own projects in hopes of nudging the federal government. Oregon and Colorado have legalized psychedelic therapy.",
      "And last month, Texas approved $50 million to study ibogaine, a potent psychedelic made from a shrub that's native to West Africa, as a treatment for opioid addiction, PTSD and other conditions. The research grant \u2014 the largest of its kind by any government \u2014 passed with support from the state's former GOP governor, Perry, and combat veterans, some who have traveled to clinics in Mexico that offer ibogaine.",
      "Ibogaine is on the U.S. government\u2019s ultra-restrictive list of illegal, Schedule 1 drugs, which also includes heroin. So advocates in Texas are hoping to build a national movement to ease restrictions on researching its use.",
      "\u201cGovernmental systems move slowly and inefficiently,\u201d said Bryan Hubbard of Americans for Ibogaine, a group formed with Perry. \u201cSometimes you find yourself constrained in terms of the progress you can make from within.\u201d",
      "Ibogaine is unique among psychedelics in both its purported benefits and risks. Small studies and anecdotal reports suggest the drug may be able to dramatically ease addiction and trauma. It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",
      "Some veterans who have taken the drug say the risks can be managed and ibogaine\u2019s healing properties go far beyond antidepressants, mood stabilizers, counseling and other standard treatments.",
      "Marcus Capone struggled with anger, insomnia and mood swings after 13 years as a Navy Seal. In 2017, at the urging of his wife Amber, he agreed to try ibogaine as a last resort. He described his first ibogaine session as \u201ca complete purge of everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut afterward I felt the weight just completely off my shoulders,\u201d he said. \u201cNo more anxiety, no more depression, life made sense all of a sudden.\u201d",
      "A nonprofit founded by the Capones, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions, or VETS, has helped over 1,000 veterans travel abroad to receive ibogaine and other psychedelics.",
      "But federal scientists have looked at the drug before \u2014 three decades ago, when the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded preliminary studies on using it as an addiction treatment. The research was discontinued after it identified \u201ccardiovascular toxicity.\"",
      "\u201cIt would be dead in the water,\u201d in terms of winning FDA approval, longtime NIDA director Nora Volkow said.",
      "But Volkow said her agency remains interested in psychedelics, including ibogaine, and is funding an American drugmaker that's working to develop a safer, synthetic version of the drug.",
      "\u201cI am very intrigued by their pharmacological properties and how they are influencing the brain,\u201d Volkow said. \u201cBut you also have to be very mindful not to fall into the hype and to be objective and rigorous in evaluating them.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",
      "Other countries that were highly dependent on U.S. funding including Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and Ivory Coast are already increasing their own resources, she said.",

      "APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community near the state capital, the project\u2019s health systems announced Thursday, creating a campus estimated to bring 8,000 jobs to the area.",
      "UNC Health and Duke Health announced in January an agreement to jointly build the proposed 500-bed pediatric hospital and linked facilities in the state\u2019s Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.",
      "At that time, the specific location wasn't finalized. But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in the Wake County town of Apex. Apex has a population of 77,000, which is already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",
      "More than 15 potential sites in several counties were considered, Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese said at an Apex news conference.",
      "The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus, located near a regional transportation interchange, will also include a children\u2019s outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds and a research and education center operated by Duke University and University of North Carolina medical schools.",
      "The campus is poised to be integrated into a long-discussed mixed-use development location called Veridea that will include thousands of new homes, retail, dining, office and research space, as well as a new Wake Technical Community College campus.",
      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The new children's hospital agreed to acquire a portion of the Veridea land, which is owned by a business partnership between the North Carolina state retirement system and the land developers, according to the State Treasurer's Office, which administers the system.",
      "State Treasurer Brad Briner said at the news conference that the land sale is a win for everyone involved, including government retirees and the pension system, \"making a modest profit and unlocking more value in the land that is adjacent.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove all, it's a win for the 11 million North Carolinians who deserve world-class pediatric care right here at home,\u201d he added.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine\u2019s economy minister and the key negotiator in the mineral deal with the U.S, Yuliia Svyrydenko, was appointed as its new prime minister Thursday, becoming the country's first new head of government since the start of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022.",
      "Svyrydenko is one of a group of officials taking on new roles in Ukraine\u2019s government, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reshuffles the Cabinet in a bid to energize a war-weary nation and boost domestic weapons production in the face of Russia\u2019s grinding invasion.",
      "At home, however, the Cabinet recalibration has not been seen as a major shift, as the Ukrainian leader continues to rely on officials who have proven their effectiveness and loyalty during the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "Zelenskyy submitted nominations on Thursday to shuffle top government positions, including the replacement of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, the longest-serving head of government in Ukraine\u2019s history.",
      "Shmyhal now moves to become defense minister, according to the parliamentary website.",
      "Other changes are expected in the Cabinet, but Svyrydenko\u2019s appointment as prime minister is taking center stage.",
      "She played a key role in negotiating a U.S.\u2013Ukraine mineral agreement, ensuring the terms were acceptable to Kyiv. Svyrydenko has frequently represented Ukraine in high-level talks with Western partners, focusing on defense cooperation, economic recovery and reconstruction.",
      "Lawmakers and fellow officials describe her as a diligent executive with a reputation for loyalty to the presidential office.",
      "On Tuesday, Zelenskyy posted a photo with Svyrydenko and Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, writing that the focus for the next six months would be increasing domestic weapons production, fully contracting all types of drones for Ukraine\u2019s defense forces, easing regulations to unlock economic potential, and ensuring delivery of social support programs.",
      "Shmyhal announced his resignation as prime minister on Tuesday. He held the position for more than five years after being appointed on March 4, 2020.",
      "Ukrainian analysts and local media have rarely portrayed Shmyhal as an independent political figure or a counterweight to Zelenskyy. Like Svyrydenko, he is seen as loyal to the president and his team.",
      "His new post as defense minister means he is not leaving government entirely, but instead remains in the cabinet in a powerful role. The defense ministry commands one of the largest budgets and carries critical importance because of the war.",
      "Shmyhal will replace Rustem Umerov, who, although he sought to push reforms, saw his tenure marked by internal turbulence and persistent dysfunction in Ukraine\u2019s defense procurement system. Despite his active role on the international stage, critics said the ministry remained plagued by mismanagement.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz are set to sign a treaty on Thursday pledging to tighten defense ties and step up law-enforcement cooperation against gangs that smuggle migrants across the English Channel.",
      "The center-right German leader is in London on his first official visit to Britain since taking office in May. Starmer visited Berlin in August 2024, announcing plans for the U.K.-Germany \u201cfriendship and cooperation\u201d treaty with Merz\u2019s predecessor, Olaf Scholz.",
      "A priority for Starmer, who heads the center-left Labour Party, is curbing the gangs behind cross-channel people smuggling. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said the plan will include regulation so that landlords cannot increase rents above inflation. Authorities will also share a list of \u201creasonable rental\u201d proposals.",
      "Brugada said her government will open a discussion with residents of Mexico's capital about her plan, but that the idea is to work on a bill that includes measures to promote affordable rent.",
      "The protest in early July was fueled by government failures and active promotion to attract digital nomads who work remotely often for foreign companies from Mexico City, according to experts. Hundreds of people marched in neighborhoods popular with tourists, but the demonstration turned violent when a small number of people began smashing storefronts and harassing foreigners.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that the protest was marked by xenophobia.",

      "Many Mexicans have complained about being priced out of their neighborhoods \u2014 in part because of a move made by Sheinbaum in 2022, when she was the Mexico City mayor and signed an agreement with Airbnb and UNESCO to boost tourism and attract digital nomads despite concern over the impact short-term rentals could have.",
      "During the protest, some people marched with signs reading \u201cGringo: Stop stealing our home\u201d and \u201cHousing regulations now!\u201d",

      "Powerful gangs in March attacked the town of Saut-d\u2019Eau, whose 100-foot-long waterfall had for decades drawn thousands of Vodou and Christian faithful alike.",
      "The town remains under gang control, preventing thousands from participating in the traditional annual pilgrimage meant to honor the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, closely associated with the Vodou goddess of Erzulie.",
      "\u201cNot going to Saut-d\u2019Eau is terrible,\u201d said Ti-Marck Ladouce. \u201cThat water is so fresh it just washes off all the evilness around you.\u201d",
      "Instead, Ladouce joined several thousand people who scrambled up a steep hill in a rural part of Haiti\u2019s capital, Port-au-Prince, on Wednesday to honor Erzulie and the Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel at a small church that served as a substitute for the waterfall.",
      "Like many, Ladouce thanked the Virgin Mary for keeping him and his family alive amid a surge of gang violence that has left at least 4,864 people dead from October to the end of June across Haiti, with hundreds of others kidnapped, raped and trafficked.",
      "\u201cPeople are praying to be saved,\u201d he said.",
      "Daniel Jean-Marcel opened his arms, closed his eyes and turned toward the sky as people around him lit candles, clutched rosaries and tried to push their way into the small church that could not hold the crowd gathered around it.",

      "On the morning of March 31, the Canaan gang led by a man known as \u201cJeff\u201d attacked Saut-d\u2019Eau. Police and a self-defense group repelled the attack, but the gang returned in early April with more than 500 men, prompting residents and authorities to flee, according to a new report from the U.N. human rights office.",
      "Angry over the ongoing violence and what the United Nations described as \u201cweak responses from authorities,\u201d residents of Saut-d\u2019Eau and other nearby communities in May and June took over a hydroelectric plant in protest, causing widespread power outages in Haiti\u2019s capital and its central region.",
      "On Wednesday, videos posted on social media showed Jeff Larose, leader of the Canaan gang, standing in the large church of Saut-d\u2019Eau that traditionally hosted the annual Mass amid the three-day pilgrimage. The church was built under a presidential order after rumors began circulating in the mid-1800s that a local farmer had seen the Virgin Mary in a palm tree there.",
      "Next to Larose stood Joseph Wilson, who goes by \u201cLanmo Sanjou\u201d and is the leader of the 400 Mawozo gang, and Jimmy Ch\u00e9rizier, best known as \u201cBarbecue\" and one of the leaders of a powerful gang federation known as \u201c Viv Ansanm,\u201d or \u201cLiving Together.\u201d",

      "The United States has deported five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos to Eswatini, a small country in southern Africa where the king still holds absolute power",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- The United States has deported five immigrants from Vietnam, Jamaica, Cuba, Yemen and Laos to Eswatini, a small country in southern Africa where the king still holds absolute power.",
      "Eswatini says it is holding the men in correctional facilities until they can be sent to their home countries, after it became the latest nation to accept third-country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Here's what to know about Eswatini:",
      "Eswatini is one of a handful of countries that are still absolute monarchies, and the only one in Africa. That means the king has absolute power over government and is not just a figurehead or a ceremonial ruler.",
      "King Mswati III has ruled Eswatini since 1986, when he turned 18 and was allowed to take his place as the monarch. He can make decisions by decree. He succeeded his father, Sobhuza II, who died in 1982.",
      "The 57-year-old Mswati III has long been criticized for ruling over a government that suppresses political dissent while he lives a lavish lifestyle in one of the poorest countries in the world.",
      "The king is reported to have 11 wives and has been the subject of scrutiny for buying luxury cars. His wealth has been estimated at between $200 million and $500 million, while the World Bank says more than half of Eswatini's 1.2 million people live on less than $4 a day.",
      "Political parties were banned by Sobhuza II in 1973. Some exist now, but they are not allowed to play any role in elections or the political process and have been reduced to civic society groups. Candidates seeking public office in Eswatini's Parliament or Senate have to stand as individuals without any party affiliation and are generally approved by traditional leaders loyal to Mswati III.",
      "Pro-democracy protests have grown in recent years and Eswatini authorities under Mswati III have been accused of crushing them using the security forces. Many dissidents live in exile.",
      "The country was previously known as Swaziland but changed to Eswatini in 2018 after the king announced it should revert to its traditional name in the Swazi language. It was Swaziland when it was under British colonial rule, which ended in 1968.",
      "Eswatini has been severely affected by HIV and has the highest prevalence in the world, with an estimated 26% of the adult population HIV positive, according to the United Nations AIDS agency.",
      "It has made significant progress in confronting that scourge but has been highly reliant on foreign aid to do that, including assistance from the U.S., which has now been cut by the Trump administration.",

    "story": [
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has unveiled a proposal for a long-term EU budget that she says will total $2.3 trillion",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union needs a new budget that would allow it to respond to crises like Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine or climate change, fund railways and energy grids, and protect farmers\u2019 livelihoods, the EU chief said Wednesday while unveiling her proposal totaling 2 trillion euros ($2.3 trillion).",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who heads the EU\u2019s executive branch, said that under her budget plan, spending on defense and space would increase five-fold, while investment in migration and border management would triple.",
      "The proposal kicks off two years of wrangling between the 27 member states which fund most of the budget and the European Parliament. The spending package \u2014 which runs from 2028 to 2034 \u2014 is seen as a statement about Europe\u2019s ambitions in the world.",
      "Von der Leyen described her plan for the budget \u2013 known as the Multiannual Financial Framework \u2013 as \u201cthe most ambitious ever proposed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is more strategic, more flexible, more transparent, and we are investing more in our capacity to respond and more in our independence,\u201d she told reporters in Brussels.",
      "But in an early sign of the troubles ahead, von der Leyen conceded that even within her own team of policy commissioners \u2014 which worked through the night to finalize the proposal \u2013 \u201cnot everyone was satisfied with the amount.\u201d",
      "EU lawmakers who will chaperone the commission\u2019s proposal through parliament over the next year and 2027, and who were briefed on it, said that the budget math doesn't \"add up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHowever you try to package this, what we have is a real-terms investment and spending freeze,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cIt is the status quo, which the Commission has always insisted is not an option.\u201d",
      "Part of the numbers confusion is due to von der Leyen's insistence that national contributions to the budget will not increase. Extra funds would be found through \u201ca step change\u201d in the way the commission raises its own money, she said.",
      "The EU as a bloc is not allowed to levy its own taxes, but it does earn revenue from things like customs duties and value added tax. The plan now is to get money through the carbon emissions trading system and a new tobacco duty, among other measures.",
      "At the same time, the EU must also pay off billions of euros in debt incurred by measures introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to help revive economies after the pandemic.",
      "As for security, von der Leyen said 100 billion euros ($116 billion) should be set aside to help Ukraine rebuild from the ravages of the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "\u201cWe are suggesting 100 billion euros ... to support recovery, resilience, and of course their path to the EU membership,\u201d she said.",
      "Outside the commission headquarters, as von der Leyen\u2019s team debated the plan, around 200 farmers gathered and threw boots at the building.",
      "\u201cEverybody is talking about security for Europe. Everybody is talking about a stronger Europe. Well ,let me tell you, you can\u2019t get stronger with an empty stomach,\u201d said Lode Ceyssens, head of the Belgian farmers trade union Boerenbond.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) \u2014 Cambodia on Wednesday said that an order by Prime Minister Hun Manet for government bodies to crackdown on criminal cybercrime operations being run in the country had resulted in the arrest of more than 1,000 suspects so far this week.",
      "Hun Manet issued the order authorising state action for \u201cmaintaining and protecting security, public order, and social safety.\u201d",

      "The United Nations and other agencies estimate that cyberscams, most of them originating from Southeast Asia, earn international criminal gangs billions of dollars annually.",
      "More than 1,000 suspects were arrested in raids in at least five provinces between Monday and Wednesday, according to statements from Information Minister Neth Pheaktra and police.",
      "Those detained included more than 200 Vietnamese, 27 Chinese, and 75 suspects from Taiwan and 85 Cambodians in the capital Phnom Penh and the southern city of Sihanoukville. Police also seized equipment, including computers and hundreds of mobile phones.",
      "At least 270 Indonesians, including 45 women, were arrested Wednesday in Poipet, a town on the border with Thailand notorious for cyberscam and gambling operations, the minister said. Elsewhere, police in the northeastern province of Kratie arrested 312 people, including nationals of Thailand, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam, while 27 people from Vietnam, China and Myanmar were arrested in the western province of Pursat.",
      "Amnesty International last month published the findings of an 18-month investigation into cybercrime in Cambodia, which the human rights group said \u201cpoint towards state complicity in abuses carried out by Chinese criminal gangs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Cambodian government is deliberately ignoring a litany of human rights abuses including slavery, human trafficking, child labor and torture being carried out by criminal gangs on a vast scale in more than 50 scamming compounds located across the country,\u201d it said.",
      "Human trafficking is closely associated with cyberscam operations, as workers are often recruited under false pretences and then held captive.",
      "\u201cDeceived, trafficked and enslaved, the survivors of these scamming compounds describe being trapped in a living nightmare \u2013 enlisted in criminal enterprises that are operating with the apparent consent of the Cambodian government,\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s Secretary General Agnes Callamard said.",
      "Cambodia's latest crackdown comes in the midst of a bitter feud with neighboring Thailand, which began with a brief armed skirmish in late May over border territory claimed by both nations and has now led to border closures and nearly daily exchanges of nationalistic insults. Friendly former leaders of both countries have become estranged and there have been hot debates over which nation\u2019s cultural heritage has influenced the other.",
      "Measures initiated by the Thai side, including cutting off cross-border electricity supplies and closing crossing points, have particularly heightened tensions, with Cambodia claiming they were churlish actions of spite to retaliate for its intention to pursue its territorial claims. Thailand said its original intention was to combat long-existing cyberscam operations in Poipet.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Bangladeshi security forces on Wednesday clashed with supporters of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, leaving at least four people dead and scores injured, a hospital official and local media said.",
      "The violence erupted in the morning and spread as a new political party formed by students who led the uprising against Hasina in August last year announced a march toward southwestern Gopalganj district, Hasina\u2019s ancestral home, and her Awami League party\u2019s stronghold.",
      "Authorities later imposed an overnight curfew in the district.",
      "Since Hasina's ouster 11 months ago, Bangladesh has been marked by chaos and unchecked mob violence. Wednesday's attack underscores the deep divisions in the country as its interim government keeps failing to bring the deteriorating security situation under control.",
      "TV footage showed pro-Hasina activists armed attacking police with sticks and setting vehicles on fire as a convoy of about 20 vehicles carrying the leaders of the students' National Citizen Party arrived as part of commemorations of the uprising.",
      "Party leaders took shelter in the office of the local police chief. Footage showed top leaders were being escorted by soldiers to an armored vehicle for safety. They later left for a neighboring district with security escorts.",
      "Jibitesh Biswas, a senior official of a state-run hospital, told reporters that the bodies of at least three people had been brought in. The country's leading English-language Daily Star reported that four people died.",
      "The interim government said Wednesday the attackers on the students would not go \u201cunpunished\" and in a statement issued on behalf of interim leader Muhammad Yunus, described the violence in Gopalganj as \u201cutterly indefensible.\"",
      "Hasina's Awami League party, which authorities banned in May, issued several statements on X condemning the violence and blaming the interim government for the deaths and injuries.",
      "\u201cWe urge the world to take note of this blatant use of security apparatus,\u201d one Awami statement said, adding that it had used mob violence against \u201cdissenters.\u201d",
      "Student leader Nahid Islam gave the authorities a 24-hour ultimatum to arrest those responsible for the Gopalganj violence and floated the prospect of another march in the neighboring district of Faridpur on Thursday.",
      "The right wing Jamaat-e-Islami party condemned the attacks on the student-led party and announced a nationwide protest in all districts and main cities for Thursday.",
      "Critics of the interim government warn of a widening polarization that has reduced hopes for national reconciliation even as Yunus' administration pledges to bring order in the post-Hasina era. They say if the situation does not improve, a peaceful transition to democracy would be jeopardized.",
      "Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yunus took over the country three days after Hasina was toppled and fled to India, pledging to restore order. He has promised a new election would be held in April next year.",
      "Hasina now faces charges of crimes against humanity while the government seeks her extradition from India, which has not responded to Bangladesh's request.",
      "Gopalganj is a politically sensitive district because Hasina father\u2019s mausoleum is located there. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country\u2019s independence leader, was buried there after he was assassinated along with most of his family members in a military coup in 1975.",
      "The National Citizen Party launched its \u201cJuly March to Rebuild the Nation\u201d at the start of the month, saying they would take place across all districts as part of its drive to position itself as a new force in Bangladeshi politics.",
      "Bangladesh's political past has been largely dominated by two dynastic parties \u2014 Hasina\u2019s Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, headed by her rival and former prime minister Khaleda Zia. The BNP, which is hopeful of coming to power in the absence of Hasina's party, was mostly silent about Wednesday's violence.",

    "story": [
      "The current and previous British governments are facing criticism over a secret program that resettled thousands of Afghans in the U.K. after the Taliban's return to power in 2021",
      "LONDON -- British governments past and present face allegations of avoiding scrutiny and undermining democracy after the revelation that thousands of Afghans have been resettled in the U.K under a program that was hidden from the media, the public and lawmakers in Parliament.",
      "Key information was also kept from the Afghans themselves, who had assisted U.K. forces and whose personal details had been disclosed in a huge data leak. Many plan to sue the British government for putting them in danger from the Taliban. Some are left in Afghanistan as the current British government says the resettlement program will end.",
      "Here\u2019s what happened in an extraordinary chain of events.",
      "The saga was triggered by the chaotic Western exit from Afghanistan in August 2021 as the Taliban, ousted from power 20 years earlier, swept across the country, seized Kabul and reimposed their strict version of Islamic law.",
      "Afghans who had worked with Western forces \u2014 as fixers, translators and in other roles \u2014 or who had served in the internationally backed Afghan army were at risk of retribution. Britain set up a program, known as the Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy, or ARAP, to bring some to the U.K.",
      "In February 2022, a defense official emailed a spreadsheet containing the personal information of nearly 19,000 ARAP applicants to someone outside the Ministry of Defense. The government says the individual thought they were sending a list of about 150 names, not the whole set.",
      "The British government only became aware of the leak when a portion of the data was posted on Facebook 18 months later by someone who threatened to publish the whole list.",
      "The leak sparked alarm among British officials who feared as many as 100,000 people were in danger when family numbers of the named individuals were added. The then-Conservative government sought a court order barring publication of the list.",
      "A judge granted a sweeping order known as a super injunction, which barred anyone from revealing not only information about the leak but the existence of the injunction itself.",
      "Super injunctions are relatively rare and their use is controversial. Most of the handful of cases in which they have come to light involved celebrities trying to prevent disclosures about their private lives. This is the first known case of a super injunction being granted to the government.",
      "Former Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said Wednesday that he sought the legal order to gain \u201ctime and space to deal with this leak, find out whether the Taliban had it\u201d and protect those at risk.",
      "Wallace said he asked for an ordinary injunction \u2014 not a super injunction \u2014 for a period of four months. The gag order remained in place for almost two years.",
      "The government began bringing to Britain the Afghans on the leaked list who were judged to be most at risk. To date, some 4,500 people \u2014 900 applicants and approximately 3,600 family members \u2014 have been brought to Britain under the program. About 6,900 people are expected to be relocated by the time it closes, at a cost of 850 million pounds ($1.1 billion).",

The review said the Taliban had other sources of information on those who had worked with the previous Afghan government and international forces and is more concerned with current threats to its authority.",
      "Given those findings, the government dropped its support for the super injunction. The injunction was lifted in court Tuesday, and minutes later Defense Secretary John Healey stood in the House of Commons to make the saga public for the first time.",

      "The U.K.\u2019s Air Safety Committee imposed the ban after Pakistan\u2019s aviation minister in June 2020 disclosed that nearly one-third of the country\u2019s pilots had cheated on their licensing exams. The claim came after a Pakistan International Airlines crash killed 97 people on May 24, 2020, in the southern city of Karachi.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s announcement follows a broader international recognition of Pakistan\u2019s efforts to improve air safety. Earlier this year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency also lifted its five-year-long ban, allowing the national flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines to resume direct flights to Europe.",
      "British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said that after \u201cextensive engagement\u201d between the U.K.\u2019s Air Safety Committee and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority, restrictions on Pakistani airlines have now been lifted. U.K. diplomatic missions in Commonwealth countries are known as high commissions and are equivalent to embassies.",
      "However, Marriott said individual airlines will still need to apply for operating permits from the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful to aviation experts in both the U.K. and Pakistan for their collaborative work to meet international safety standards,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile it will take time for flights to resume, once the logistics are in place, I look forward to using a Pakistani carrier when visiting family and friends.\"",
      "The high commission emphasized that decisions on delisting countries or carriers from the U.K. Air Safety List are made through an independent safety process overseen by the Air Safety Committee.",
      "With more than 1.6 million people of Pakistani heritage living in the U.K., and thousands of British nationals residing in Pakistan, it said the move will help families to reconnect and potentially boost bilateral trade ties.",

      "WOODINVILLE, Wash. -- More than 1 million low-income households \u2014 most of them working families with children \u2014 who depend on the nation\u2019s public housing and Section 8 voucher programs could be at risk of losing their government-subsidized homes under the Trump administration\u2019s proposal to impose a two-year time limit on rental assistance.",
      "That\u2019s according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "The NYU report also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots.",
      "\u201cIf currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,\" for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities \"would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.\u201d",
      "Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is determined to reshape HUD\u2019s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations.",
      "At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.\u201d",
      "Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there\u2019s little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented \u2014 how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined.",
      "The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD\u2019s nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years.",
      "HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study.",
      "\u201cThere is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,\u201d Lovett said in a statement.",
      "The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area\u2019s median income.",
      "\u201cHousing assistance is especially impactful for children,\u201d said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can \u201cchange in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,\u201d Aiken said.",
      "Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and \u201cable-bodied\u201d for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction.",
      "Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent \u2014 30% of her household income \u2014 for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington.",
      "Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: \u201cI like that I can afford it.\u201d",
      "Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits \u2014 the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals.",
      "Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling.",
      "\u201cAny conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,\u201d said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities.",
      "Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn\u2019t have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent.",
      "Shawnt\u00e9 Spears of the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo in California said the agency's five-year time limits have \u201cgiven folks motivation\u201d to meet their goals in tandem with self-sufficiency programs funded by dollars Trump wants to cut. Time limits also give more households the chance to use vouchers, she said.",
      "But with the Bay Area\u2019s high rents, some tenants still have to spend more than half of their income on rent once their time is up or end up back on waitlists.",
      "\u201cI believe the program is very helpful in getting folks prepared but there lies this really, really significant rent burden here in our county,\u201d said Spears. \u201cWhen folks do leave our time-limited program, they are facing an uphill battle.\u201d",

About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel from France in small boats in 2024, and more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025. Dozens of people have died trying to cross.",
      "Berlin agreed last year to make facilitating the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. a criminal offence, a move that will give law enforcements more powers to investigate the supply and storage of small boats to be used for the crossings. Merz is expected to commit to adopting the law change by the end of the year.",
      "\u201cChancellor Merz\u2019s commitment to make necessary changes to German law to disrupt the supply lines of the dangerous vessels which carry illegal migrants across the Channel is hugely welcome,\u201d Starmer said, calling the U.K. and Germany \u201cthe closest of allies.\u201d",
      "Germany and the U.K. \u2013 Europe\u2019s largest and second-largest economies \u2013 are also expected to announce a series of investment deals.",
      "The treaty builds on a defense pact the U.K. and Germany, two of the biggest European supporters of Ukraine, signed last year pledging closer co-operation against a growing threat from Russia. It includes a promise to come to one another\u2019s aid in case of attack.",
      "The two leaders also are expected to agree Thursday to joint export campaigns for jointly produced equipment such as Boxer armored vehicles and Typhoon jets, and to develop a deep precision strike missile in the next decade.",
      "Starmer has worked to improve relations with Britain\u2019s neighbors, strained by the U.K.\u2019s acrimonious departure from the European Union in 2020. He has sought to rebuild ties strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. He has ruled out rejoining the 27-nation bloc\u2019s single market or customs union, and has been cool to the idea of a youth mobility agreement with the EU, but has sought to reduce trade barriers and to strengthen defense cooperation.",
      "\u201cI make no secret of the fact I very much regret to this day that Britain left the European Union,\u201d Merz told the German parliament last week. \u201cBut if they at least work together with us again in the area of foreign and security policy, then that is a very good sign. Prime Minister Keir Starmer wants that.\u201d",

      "Eight projects are vying for a state license to operate a casino in the lucrative New York City market",
      "NEW YORK -- A Caesars Palace casino in the heart of Times Square. A sprawling gambling hall along Coney Island\u2019s iconic boardwalk. A Hard Rock casino complex next to the home stadium of baseball\u2019s New York Mets.",
      "Eight projects are bidding for a state license to operate a casino in the lucrative New York City market, each dangling the prospect of generational investment in America\u2019s largest metropolitan region.",
      "But one \u2014 a Bally's casino proposed on a Bronx golf course once run by President Donald Trump\u2019s company \u2014 may have already run out of luck, after city lawmakers denied it a key approval this week.",
      "All of the proposed casinos, in application materials submitted in recent days, promise to create thousands of new jobs, flashy new community amenities in the form of hotels, shops, restaurants and entertainment venues and billions of dollars a year in taxable gambling revenues for the state\u2019s coffers.",
      "How realistic those promises are, though, is an open question, given the proliferation of casinos in the northeast and the explosion of online gambling in recent years, casino experts say.",
      "The arrival of full-fledged casino resorts in New York City has been years in the making.",
      "The gambling industry spent mightily to secure approval from New York voters in a referendum authorizing the licensing of up to seven full casinos with live table games back in 2013. But the state initially allowed upstate venues a head start.",
      "The state's Gaming Commission says it hopes to finally award up to three downstate licenses in December. But before then, community advisory committees appointed by lawmakers and local officials will weigh community opinions of each plan.",
      "Nearly all the casino proposals face some degree of local push back.",
      "On Monday, the New York City Council denied Bally's a needed rezoning change following local resident concerns about the environmental impact of its $4 billion proposal, which also calls for a 500-room hotel and a 2,000-seat event center.",
      "Bally\u2019s, which bought the former Trump Links course in 2023, had promised to pay Trump another $115 million if it were to secure a casino license, though that was not among the objections voiced by the Democratic majority on the council nor the Republican lawmaker representing the Bronx district. Spokespersons for Bally\u2019s declined to comment on the future of the project this week.",
      "Not surprisingly, the debate over the proposed Times Square casino has taken center stage, with supporters and opponents recently holding dueling rallies in the Crossroads of the World.",
      "Among the prominent groups opposed to the $5.4 billion plan is the Broadway League, a trade group representing America\u2019s performing arts theaters. It says a casino would draw patrons away from neighborhood businesses and threaten a theater industry still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The project's backers have countered that the plan, which calls for renovating a skyscraper that currently houses the Minskoff Theatre, home of long-running \u201cThe Lion King\u201d musical, will actually boost demand for Broadway tickets.",
      "The developers, which have also enlisted Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation to curate their entertainment offerings, promise $250 million in community projects, including a public safety plan designed by former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and a multimillion-dollar civil rights museum that helped earn an endorsement from the Rev. Al Sharpton.",
      "The two other casinos proposed in Manhattan \u2014 one for its West Side and another on its East Side \u2014 could face similar headwinds, given their proximity to residential neighborhoods, according to casino experts.",
      "But the proposed West Side resort, near the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Lincoln Tunnel to New Jersey, could reel in business travelers and convention attendees, if it can win over locals, said Soojin Ha, a lecturer at Cornell University\u2019s business school.",
      "Meanwhile in Brooklyn, organizers of the quirky Mermaid Parade are among those leading the charge against a Coney Island casino, arguing the plan would remove large chunks of the boardwalk\u2019s iconic amusement rides and block access to the public beach.",
      "Since the 2013 referendum, four full casinos have opened in New York, though all of them are located upstate, miles away from Manhattan. The state also has nine gambling halls offering slot machines and other electronic gambling machines but no live table games.",
      "Some three hours drive north of Manhattan are the Native American tribe-owned Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos in Connecticut. Two hours south are the New Jersey shore casinos of Atlantic City, and less than two hours due west in Pennsylvania is the tribe-owned Wind Creek Casino at the former site of Bethlehem Steel.",
      "Despite the competition from seemingly all corners, New York City\u2019s dense market could sustain three gambling halls, depending on where they\u2019re located, suggests John Holden, a business professor at Indiana University who specializes in gambling law.",
      "\u201cWe typically see fairly rosy revenue projections put out by the gaming industry, but the New York City market is really without comparison,\u201d he said.",
      "The state could hedge its bets by awarding two of the three licenses to proven winners: the racinos -- slot parlors built alongside horse racing tracks \u2014 that have been successfully operating for years in the New York City area, said Alan Woinski, a New Jersey-based gambling consultant.",
      "MGM Resorts is proposing a $2.3 billion expansion of the Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway. Resorts World, owned by Malaysian casino giant Genting, is proposing a $5.5 billion investment to its gaming facility at the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.",
      "Those expansions, Woinski noted, could be rolled out in a matter of months, meaning the state wouldn\u2019t have to wait years for the construction of a wholly new site to start reaping the financial windfall.",

      "TOKYO -- Canadian retail chain Alimentation Couche-Tard is dropping its proposal to acquire Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, citing frustration in ongoing negotiations that showed \u201ca lack of constructive engagement.\u201d",
      "The 7-Eleven parent company rejected an offer last year, but Couche-Tard, which runs the global Circle K chain, was still interested and tried to coax a deal with the Japanese chain known here as \u201cconbini.\u201d",
      "In a letter dated July 16 and sent to the Seven & i board, Couche-Tard stressed it had made a good offer earlier this year in a proposal of 2,600 yen ($17.50) per ordinary share in cash, which it said represented a 47.6% premium to the stock price. The initial offer, made last year, was for 2,200 yen ($14.86) per share in cash.",
      "In the letter, sent to media Thursday and signed by its two top executives, including founder Alain Bouchard, Couche-Tard expressed exasperation at the response it was getting from Seven & i despite repeated attempts at dialogue.",
      "\u201cWe have been very patient and respectful throughout this process, beginning with our meeting on July 23, 2024,\u201d the letter said.",
      "\u201cYou have engaged in a calculated campaign of obfuscation and delay, to the great detriment of 7 & i and its shareholders. We believe this approach reinforces our concerns about your approach to governance. Based on this persistent lack of good faith engagement, we are withdrawing our proposal.\u201d",
      "Couche-Tard, which runs nearly 17,000 stores in more than 30 countries and territories, including the U.S., said the documents it got lacked key information, executives were no-shows at meetings, and the meetings it did have ended up being \u201creadouts\u201d of statements, not frank discussions.",
      "Seven & i acknowledged the dropped offer Thursday and said it considered talks \u201cin good faith and constructively.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain fully committed to our standalone value creation plan, which we have been pursing in parallel, and to unlocking the value of our businesses, including our North American convenience store business. Our plan is concrete and actionable,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "Some analysts say Seven & i management has not fully leveraged the business\u2019 global potential or delivered enough value to shareholders, and could use better marketing, although its bottom line is unlikely to be affected by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies.",
      "The 7-Eleven franchise, which spans more than 85,000 stores in Japan, the U.S. and Europe, has a new chief executive, Stephen Hayes Dacus, the first foreigner tapped to head 7-Eleven. Dacus, an American whose mother is Japanese, has promised a leaner business by focusing on the supply chain and tailoring shop offerings to various regions.",
      "For the first quarter of this fiscal year, Seven & i reported a doubling in profits to 49 billion yen ($330 million), mainly due to previously announced sales of property and equipment at its Ito-Yokado Co. retail chain.",
      "Quarterly sales held up, as a favorable exchange rate helped some overseas earnings, according to the Tokyo-based chain. The seemingly omnipresent 7-Eleven chain speckles the streets of Japan, offering everything from stationery items and rice balls to hot coffee and utility bill payments.",

      "The nation\u2019s largest public utility says it is looking at other sites for a new natural gas power plant after its preferred location in Tennessee drew heavy public scrutiny, including from country musician John Rich",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 The nation's largest public utility says it is looking at other sites for a new natural gas power plant after its preferred location in Tennessee drew heavy public scrutiny, including from country musician John Rich.",
      "The Tennessee Valley Authority announced Tuesday that the Cheatham County site is no longer its preferred one.",
      "Rich, a conservative supporter of President Donald Trump who has Cheatham County roots, has been a key opponent of TVA's 900-megawatt plant in the county. He said he enlisted Trump to team up on the issue. A TVA spokesperson declined to comment about Rich\u2019s comments, including whether Trump was involved. A White House spokesperson also declined to comment.",
      "The community has raised concerns about the potential impact on water quality, air quality, noise pollution, safety, property rights and more, in a rural area that also has homes and schools nearby. Clean energy and environmental groups have also led resistance to the proposal.",
      "Rich said Trump and U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins \u201cjoined forces with me and all the residents of Cheatham County.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey pulled out under threat,\u201d Rich said about TVA in a social media post Tuesday. \"They pulled out because they\u2019re afraid President Trump is going to fire every member on that board.\u201d",
      "Based on feedback, the federal utility says it is considering a site at a nearby industrial park and other Middle Tennessee locations.",
      "Additionally, it floated options such as working with the Trump administration to extend the use of some fossil fuel plants. The utility has been planning to retire the last of its coal-fired plants by 2035. But Trump has signed executive orders aimed at boosting the coal industry.",
      "Power from the proposed Cheatham plant was intended to replace some of the electricity from the second unit of the coal-fired Cumberland Fossil Plant, which had been planned for retirement in 2028 but is now among the coal units being evaluated for potentially longer life.",
      "The site that sparked opposition includes the power plant and a battery storage system on 286 acres in Cheatham County, in addition to a 12-mile natural gas pipeline and up to 45 miles of transmission lines to the project. Rich last week posted a map showing many areas of farmland around the preferred area, saying it \u201cCANNOT happen.\u201d Rollins, the agriculture secretary, replied, \u201cON IT\u201d and \u201cStandby.\u201d",
      "Rich additionally has called for a \u201ccomplete revamping\u201d of TVA, saying, \u201cCheatham County ain't the only place they're doing this.\u201d",
      "Any final decision on the plant would need to await the installation of more TVA board members.",
      "Trump recently announced four nominees for the board, which for months has not had enough members to take many actions because Trump fired some of former President Joe Biden\u2019s picks. TVA provides power to more than 10 million people across seven southern states.",
      "The board normally has nine members and requires five to make a quorum. It currently has three. Trump\u2019s picks would not be seated until the U.S. Senate confirms them.",
      "Clean energy advocates applauded TVA\u2019s decision to back off the Cheatham County location, but said it should instead invest more in clean energy options and heed the concern of communities where similar gas plants are proposed in Cumberland City, Kingston and Memphis.",
      "\u201cInstead of simply shifting those harmful impacts to another area, TVA should scrap its plans for a new gas plant altogether and invest in clean and cost-effective power options, like solar power and battery storage,\u201d said Trey Bussey, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center.",

      "Sandisk, known for making flash drives and memory cards, was looking to break ground on the project in 2025, according to documents provided by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation.",
      "Michigan offered Sandisk $1.925 billion in cash grants, $250 million in workforce development funding and about $3.76 billion in tax breaks, according to documents dated to August 2024.",
      "Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act incentivizing technology development about halfway through former President Joe Biden's term. Even as Trump and Republican lawmakers have since threatened to put an end to the act, the Department of Commerce was collaborating with Sandisk on securing federal incentives through the package.",
      "Whitmer in her statement said that the company is no longer looking to build a semiconductor facility anywhere in the U.S. In a speech in May, Whitmer said she had been advocating with the Trump administration directly to help bring a chip plant to the state.",

      "Pop Mart has struck it rich",
      "Pop Mart has struck it rich. The Chinese company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers said this week that it expects profit for the first six months of this year to jump by at least 350% compared with the prior-year period, largely because of its smash hit plush toy, the Labubu. Pop Mart joins a small list of companies that have tapped into the zeitgeist, drawing in millions of buyers who, for one reason or another, simply must get their hands on a toy or gadget of the moment.",
      "But what makes the Labubu a must-have, or any toy for that matter, is a decades-old question that toy makers have yet to figure out.",
      "Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years.",
      "Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday.",
      "Cabbage Patch Kids, which were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco, were relaunched in 2004, looking to take part in the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.",
      "A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls entered the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2023.",
      "Beanie Babies captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs.",
      "Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, Ty Warner, a billionaire in three years.",
      "In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion.",
      "Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s.",
      "Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies.",
      "In 2013 Tamagotchi was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in May.",
      "Fidget spinners \u2014 the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles \u2014 were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains.",
      "Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media.",
      "While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid but became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction.",
      "The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.",
      "In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn\u2019t until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out.",
      "Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart\u2019s plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company\u2019s annual report.",

      "U.S. wholesale inflation cooled last month, despite worries that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs would push prices higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. wholesale inflation cooled last month, despite worries that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs would push prices higher for goods before they reach consumers.",
      "The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its producer price index was unchanged last month from May after rising 0.3% the previous month. June wholesale prices rose 2.3% from a year earlier, the smallest year-over-year gain since September. Both measures came in below what economists had expected.",
      "Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so called core producer prices were also unchanged from May and up 2.6% from June 2024.",
      "The report on wholesale inflation arrived a day after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices last month rose 2.7% from June 2024, the biggest year-over-year gain since February, as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs pushed up the cost of everything from groceries to appliances.",
      "Consumer prices and producers prices do not always move in tandem, however.",
      "Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, saw some signs of the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs in a 0.3% increase in core wholesale goods prices. Furniture prices rose 1% from May and home electronics 0.8%, he noted. Both of those types of goods are heavily imported.",
      "But producer prices at steel mills fell 5.5% despite Trump\u2019s hefty 50% tax on imported steel.",
      "Some companies bought products before Trump rolled out his tariffs and have relied on those inventories to keep a lid on prices. But Saunders warned that those inventories are running low and that Trump plans to impose stiff tariffs (such as 25% levies on Japanese and South Korean imports) starting Aug. 1.",
      "\u201cWe are not out of the woods yet,\u2019\u2019 Saunders wrote in a commentary.",
      "The producer price report showed that auto retailers' profit margins dropped 5.4%, suggesting that car dealers were eating the cost of Trump's 25% tariff on some imported cars and auto parts. That might explain why new vehicle prices fell last month in the consumer price report Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe doubt that auto retailers will continue to absorb the tariffs indefinitely,'' wrote Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, \u201dbut they have room to fall a good deal further after they surged during the spike in sales as people sought to get ahead of tariffs on imported vehicles.''",
      "Wholesale prices can offer an early look at where consumer inflation might be headed. Economists also monitor the report closely because some of its components, notably measures of health care and financial services, flow into the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge \u2014 the personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, index.",
      "Inflation began to flare up for the first time in decades in 2021, as the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns. That prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs helped bring inflation down from the peaks it reached in 2022, and last year the Fed felt comfortable enough with the progress to cut rates three times.",
      "But it has turned cautious this year while it waits to see the inflationary impact of Trump\u2019s trade policies. Trump has aggressively stepped up pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which has been seen as a threat to the central bank\u2019s independence.",

      "UK inflation has risen to a near 18-month high in June as food prices surged for the third month running",
      "LONDON -- UK inflation rose to a near 18-month high in June as food prices surged for the third month running, official figures showed Wednesday. Economists said the unexpected increase could prompt the Bank of England to lower interest rates slower than currently anticipated.",
      "The Office for National Statistics said consumer prices rose by an annual rate of 3.6% in June, up from 3.4% in May. That was the highest rate since January 2024.",
      "The statistics agency said higher food prices was largely behind the increase. Fuel and transport costs also contributed.",
      "Though inflation remains way above the Bank of England's target rate of 2%, most economists think the central bank will opt to cut interest rates again at its next meeting on Aug. 7 as sluggish economic growth is anticipated to weigh on prices over the coming year or two.",
      "Since its first quarter-point rate cut last August from the 16-year high of 5.25%, the Bank of England has played it steady, reducing interest rates every three months to the current 4.25%.",
      "However, some economists believe the higher inflation rate may cause some jitters among rate-setters, which could see the bank delay further reductions.",
      "\u201cWhile June\u2019s hot inflation won\u2019t deter policymakers from sanctioning an August policy loosening, given mounting worries over economic conditions, these figures may increase caution over the pace of future rate cuts,\u201d said Suren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.",

    "story": [
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid and Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two strong choices for those willing to sacrifice some interior space, especially in the third row, for exceptional fuel economy and a lower price",
      "The 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid and 2025 Toyota Highlander Hybrid are two three-row SUVs with compelling attributes if you\u2019re shopping for a family-oriented vehicle. First, they\u2019re both hybrids and get excellent fuel economy. They\u2019re also smaller and less expensive than many other three-row SUVs, such as the Kia Telluride and Toyota Grand Highlander. Not everyone needs a giant vehicle with a third-row seat that can fit full-size adults \u2014 something for occasional use by bigger kids or teens can easily suffice.",
      "If any or all of that sounds like what you\u2019re looking for, the Sorento and Highlander hybrids should fit the bill. But which one should you buy? Edmunds\u2019 car experts have tested both to find out.",
      "We\u2019ve already indicated that the Sorento and Highlander have less third-row legroom than bigger three-row SUVs. They also have less cargo space when you raise their third-row seats. Of these two vehicles, the Highlander is bigger on the outside, although that doesn\u2019t entirely translate to a bigger interior. It\u2019s wider and comes standard with seating for six people. You can get a Highlander Hybrid with an optional second-row bench seat that increases capacity to seven.",
      "The Sorento Hybrid only comes with second-row captain\u2019s chairs and, as a result, it has a maximum six-passenger capacity. The Highlander can also fit slightly more stuff behind its third row \u2014 think an extra duffel or big grocery bag \u2014 and its advantage increases with each row lowered.",
      "On the other hand, the Sorento has slightly more third-row legroom and headroom. That\u2019s relative since only small people can fit in the way back of each. Indeed, the Highlander\u2019s advantage isn\u2019t that significant, and the Sorento\u2019s smaller exterior size is a benefit in terms of parking and maneuverability \u2014 two reasons one can contemplate this smaller three-row subset to begin with.",
      "Advantage: Toyota Highlander Hybrid",
      "The Sorento Hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 36 mpg in combined city/highway driving in its standard front-wheel-drive configuration. Opting for all-wheel drive drops that slightly to 34 mpg combined. Every Highlander Hybrid has all-wheel drive and gets an EPA-estimated 35 mpg combined. You can pretty much consider this a tie.",
      "Performance differs, however. At the Edmunds test track, an all-wheel-drive Sorento Hybrid accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, which is a respectable time for a three-row hybrid SUV. It feels quick, too, thanks to the ample torque provided by the turbocharged engine and electric motor. It also has a six-speed automatic transmission that shifts quickly and smoothly. Having front-wheel drive standard is also nice as it lowers the cost of entry for those who don\u2019t need the winter-ready traction of all-wheel drive.",
      "The Highlander Hybrid went from zero to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds, which is slower than non-hybrid SUVs by about a second. Power is readily available and smoothly delivered, but Toyota\u2019s more typical hybrid powertrain features a continuously variable automatic transmission that makes the engine drone under hard acceleration. That engine is also not turbocharged.",
      "Advantage: Kia Sorento Hybrid",
      "The Kia Sorento Hybrid starts at $40,105, or about $8,000 less than the $48,315 Highlander Hybrid \u2014 adding all-wheel drive to the Kia only reduces the gap by $1,800. The Highlander does come with a few extra standard features to partially offset its higher price, but we don\u2019t think they fully justify the price premium. Moreover, the Highlander continues to be similarly more expensive when you compare each vehicle\u2019s more well-equipped trim levels.",
      "The Sorento also has a better infotainment system as standard, with a 10.25-inch touchscreen packing integrated navigation. The Highlander\u2019s standard unit is only 8 inches and lacks navigation. You can, however, add the 12.3-inch touchscreen that\u2019s standard on upper trims to the base trim as a stand-alone option. Feature content within the infotainment systems is comparable, but the Kia has multiple USB ports in each row whereas the Highlander has none in the third row. In terms of functionality, we score both the Toyota and Kia tech interfaces similarly strong in terms of usability.",
      "Safety technology content is similarly robust in both SUVs, but the Sorento\u2019s are superior in terms of performance, especially the adaptive cruise control system.",
      "Advantage: Kia",
      "The Sorento and Highlander hybrids are similar in concept, but our testing team ultimately scores the Kia higher. Moreover, the Toyota is so much more expensive regardless of trim level that it makes the Kia look like that much stronger of a choice.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he has finally found a way to achieve his goal of removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion renovation project.",
      "The push comes after a monthslong campaign by Trump to try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker, who has resisted the Republican president's calls to slash interest rates out of concerns about the administration's tariffs sparking higher levels of inflation.",
      "Trump indicated Tuesday that Powell\u2019s handling of an extensive renovation project on two Fed buildings in Washington could be grounds to take the unprecedented and possibly legally dubious step of firing him. \u201cI think it sort of is,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cWhen you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it\u2019s really disgraceful,\u201d Trump said, adding that he never saw the Fed chair as someone who needed a \u201cpalace.\u201d",
      "The project has been underway for years, going back to Trump\u2019s first term. But it only recently caught the White House\u2019s attention. Trump maintains Fed rate cuts would lower the costs of government borrowing, while Powell has warned a premature rate cut could worsen inflation and ultimately raise those borrowing costs.",
      "The risk of the Fed losing its political independence could undermine America\u2019s financial markets, possibly leading to a meltdown in stocks and investors charging a premium to lend to the U.S. economy.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "The Fed chair has been an obstacle in Trump's efforts to gain total control over the executive branch.",
      "Powell and his board have the dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable, a task that can require them to make politically unpopular moves such as raising interest rates to hold inflation in check. The general theory is that keeping the Fed free from the influence of the White House \u2014 other than for nominations of Fed officials \u2014 allows it to fulfill its mission based on what the economy needs, instead of what a politician wants.",
      "An attempt to remove Powell from his job before his term ends in May 2026 would undercut the Fed\u2019s long-standing independence from day-to-day politics and could lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and a weaker economy.",
      "The Supreme Court recently signaled that Trump can\u2019t fire Powell simply because the president disagrees with him on interest rates. But legally he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or dereliction of duty.",
      "Trump's workaround appears to be that Powell misrepresented the renovation project in congressional testimony and that the cost is excessive, thus meriting his dismissal.",
      "The Fed says its main headquarters, known as the Marriner S. Eccles building, was in dire need of an upgrade because its electrical, plumbing and HVAC systems, among others, are nearly obsolete and some date back to the building's construction in the 1930s.",
      "The renovation will also remove asbestos, lead and other hazardous elements and update the building with modern electrical and communications systems. The H-shaped building, named after a former Fed chair in the 1930s and '40s, is located near some of Washington\u2019s highest-profile monuments and has references to classical architecture and marble in the facades and stonework. The central bank is also renovating a building next door that it acquired in 2018.",
      "The Fed says there has been periodic maintenance to the structures but adds this is the first \u201ccomprehensive renovation.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials have criticized the Fed over the project's expense, which has reached $2.5 billion, about $600 million more than was originally budgeted.",
      "Like a beleaguered homeowner facing spiraling costs for a remodeling project, the Fed cites many reasons for the greater expense. Construction costs, including for materials and labor, rose sharply during the inflation spike in 2021 and 2022. More asbestos needed to be removed than expected. Washington's local restrictions on building heights forced it to build underground, which is pricier.",
      "In 2024, the Fed's board canceled its planned renovations of a third building because of rising costs.",
      "The Fed says the renovations will reduce costs \u201cover time\u201d because it will be able to consolidate its roughly 3,000 Washington-based employees into fewer buildings and will no longer need to rent as much extra space as it does now.",
      "Russ Vought, the administration's top budget adviser, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d about the Fed's \u201costentatious overhaul\u201d of its facilities.",
      "The Fed's renovation plans call for \u201crooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more,\" Vought said in last week's letter.",
      "Powell has disputed the claims, which were given wide circulation in a paper issued by the Mercatus Center, a think tank at George Mason University, in March 2025. The paper was written by Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College and former Fed staffer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no VIP dining room,\" Powell said last month during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. \u201cThere\u2019s no new marble. ... There are no special elevators. There are no new water features. ... And there's no roof terrace gardens.\u201d",
      "Some of those elements were removed from initial building plans submitted in 2021, the Fed says.",
      "The Fed's changes to its building plans have opened it up to another line of attack: White House officials suggest the Fed violated the terms of the approval it received from a local planning commission by changing its plans.",

      "The three countries' ambassadors to the United Nations met Tuesday at Germany\u2019s U.N. Mission to discuss a possible Iranian deal and reimposing the sanctions. The matter also came up in a phone call Monday between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the foreign ministers of the three countries, according to two U.S. officials.",

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said Tuesday that the three European countries would be justified in reapplying sanctions.",
      "\"With regard to Iran, the minister reiterated the priority of resuming negotiations to establish a long-term framework for Iran\u2019s nuclear program,'' the French Foreign Ministry said in a statement after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. \u2018\u2019Without a verifiable commitment from Iran by the end of August at the latest, France, Germany and the U.K. will be justified in reapplying the UN sanctions (snapbacks) that were lifted 10 years ago.''",
      "The diplomats did not provide details of the deal being sought. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in recent days that Tehran would accept a resumption of nuclear talks with the U.S. if there were assurances of no more attacks, following Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities.",
      "He said there should be \u201ca firm guarantee that such actions will not be repeated, stressing that \u201cthe attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities has made it more difficult and complicated to achieve a solution.\"",

Without mentioning her by name, but referring to the meeting at the National Assembly committee where Feit\u00f3 participated, D\u00edaz-Canel said on his X account: \u201cthe lack of sensitivity in addressing vulnerability is highly questionable. The revolution cannot leave anyone behind; that is our motto, our militant responsibility.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Tuesday advanced President Donald Trump's request to cancel some $9 billion in previously approved spending, overcoming concerns from some lawmakers about what the rescissions could mean for impoverished people around the globe and for public radio and television stations in their home states.",
      "The Senate vote was 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.",
      "A final vote in the Senate could occur as early as Wednesday. The bill would then return to the House for another vote before it would go to Trump's desk for his signature before a Friday deadline.",
      "Republicans winnowed down the president's request by taking out his proposed $400 million cut to a program known as PEPFAR. That change increased the prospects for the bill's passage. The politically popular program is credited with saving millions of lives since its creation under then-President George W. Bush to combat HIV/AIDS.",
      "The president is also looking to claw back money for foreign aid programs targeted by his Department of Government Efficiency and for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a $36 trillion debt, we have to do something to get spending under control,\" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Republicans met with Russ Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, during their weekly conference luncheon as the White House worked to address their concerns. He fielded about 20 questions from senators.",
      "The White House campaign to win over potential holdouts had some success. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., tweeted that he would vote to support the measure after working with the administration to \u201cfind Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.\u201d",
      "Some senators worried that the cuts to public media could decimate many of the 1,500 local radio and television stations around the country that rely on some federal funding to operate. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes more than 70% of its funding to those stations.",
      "Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the Republican chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she was particularly concerned about a lack of specifics from the White House.",
      "\u201cThe rescissions package has a big problem \u2014 nobody really knows what program reductions are in it,\" Collins said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t because we haven\u2019t had time to review the bill. Instead, the problem is that OMB has never provided the details that would normally be part of this process.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said she didn't want the Senate to be going through numerous rounds of rescissions.",
      "\u201cWe are lawmakers. We should be legislating,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cWhat we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told: 'This is the priority and we want you to execute on it. We'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Collins and Murkowski joined with Democrats in voting against the Senate taking up the measure.",

      "\u201cThey would like a blank check is what they would like. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate,\" McConnell said.",
      "But the large majority of Republicans were supportive of Trump's request.",
      "\u201cThis bill is a first step in a long but necessary fight to put our nation\u2019s fiscal house in order,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo.",
      "Democrats warned that it\u2019s absurd to expect them to work with Republicans on bipartisan spending measures if Republicans turn around a few months later and use their majority to cut the parts they don\u2019t like.",
      "\u201cIt shreds the appropriations process,\u201d said Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats. \u201cThe Appropriations Committee, and indeed this body, becomes a rubber stamp for whatever the administration wants.\u201d",
      "Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said that tens of millions of Americans rely on local public radio and television stations for local news, weather alerts and educational programs. He warned that many could lose access to that information because of the rescissions.",
      "\u201cAnd these cuts couldn't come at a worse time,\u201d Schumer said. \"The floods in Texas remind us that speedy alerts and up-to-the-minute forecasts can mean the difference between life and death.\u201d",
      "Democrats also scoffed at the GOP's stated motivation for taking up the bill. The amount of savings pales compared to the $3.4 trillion in projected deficits over the next decade that Republicans put in motion in passing Trump's big tax and spending cut bill two weeks ago.",
      "\u201cNow, Republicans are pretending they are concerned about the debt,\" said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. \u201cSo concerned that they need to shut down local radio stations, so concerned they are going to cut off \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 ... The idea that that is about balancing the debt is laughable.\u201d",
      "With Republicans providing enough votes to take up the bill, it sets up the potential for 10 hours of debate plus votes on scores of potentially thorny amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama. The House has already shown its support for the president\u2019s request with a mostly party line 214-212 vote, but since the Senate is amending the bill, it will have to go back to the House for another vote.",
      "Republicans who vote against the measure also face the prospect of incurring Trump's wrath. He has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the rescissions package. He said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cAny Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,\u201d he said.",

That works out to a profit of $1.60 per share, beating the $1.41 analysts expected and the $1.33 from the same quarter a year ago.",

      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says he raised concerns with Chinese President Xi Jinping about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise near Australia",
      "BEIJING -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he complained to China's President Xi Jinping during a meeting on Tuesday about a Chinese naval live-fire exercise off the Australian coast that forced commercial aircraft to change course.",
      "The exercise, held in February, saw a Chinese flotilla partially circumnavigate Australia in international waters beneath a busy commercial flight path in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand.",
      "The mission was widely regarded as a display of Chinese military strength and was among several issues raised in what Albanese described as a \u201cvery constructive meeting.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Xi said that China engaged in exercises, just as Australia engages in exercises,\u201d Albanese told reporters, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea.",
      "\u201cThere was no breach of international law by China, but that we were concerned about the notice and the way that it happened, including the live-fire exercises,\u201d Albanese added.",
      "Albanese said the Chinese leader did not mention U.S. pressure on allies to declare positions on a potential war over Taiwan.",
      "\u201cI reaffirmed on Taiwan Australia's position of support for the status quo,\u201d Albanese said. Australia has a one-China policy that recognizes the People\u2019s Republic of China as the sole legal government of China and considers Taiwan a part of China.",
      "With the 10th anniversary of Australia's free trade deal with China falling this year, both governments have agreed to review the pact with an aim to improve economic relations.",
      "Following the meeting with Xi, Albanese met Premier Li Qiang and Chairman Zhao Leji of the National People\u2019s Congress.",
      "At the outset of the leaders' meeting, Xi told Albanese that seeking common ground while setting aside differences is in line with \"the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples.\u201d",
      "Albanese concurred with Xi's remark, saying \u201cThat approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.\u201d",
      "There had been speculation that Xi would use the meeting to raise Albanese\u2019s plan to end a Chinese company\u2019s 99-year-lease on the strategically important Port of Darwin, which the United States is concerned could be used to spy on its military forces.",
      "Landbridge Industry Australia, a subsidiary of Rizhao-based Shandong Landbridge Group, signed the lease with the debt-laden Northern Territory government in 2015. That was three years after U.S. Marines began annual rotations through Darwin as part of the U.S. pivot to Asia.",
      "Chinese social media influencer Lu Wenxing had posted that China could retaliate against ending the lease with \u201ccountermeasures, such as restricting Australian companies\u2019 market access in China or tightening imports of key resources such as iron ore.\u201d",
      "But Albanese said Xi didn\u2019t raise the lease, nor did he discuss the broader issue of Australia\u2019s foreign investment rules that prevent Chinese ownership of critical infrastructure.",
      "Reporters questioned Albanese about Chinese security officials' treatment of Australian journalists who traveled to China with him.",
      "Reporter Stephen Dziedzic said he was with a camera crew on Tuesday recording a piece to camera for Australian TV news in front of a Beijing landmark when they were interrupted by security guards. The guard told them police would be called and the Australians weren't permitted to leave.",
      "Another reporter, Anna Henderson, said guards told journalists to delete their footage. Australian diplomats intervened and TV crews were permitted to leave.",
      "\u201cChina has a different system, obviously, with the media,\u201d Albanese said.",

      "Collier County, Florida, uses one of the most advanced 911 systems in the U.S., allowing callers to send texts and videos",
      "NAPLES, Fla. -- When an emergency happens in Collier County, Florida, the 911 calls go to one of the most high-tech communications centers in the U.S., where callers can send text and video from the scene to dispatchers.",
      "Moving to what's known as an NG911 \u2014 or Next Generation 911 \u2014 system is a journey Sheriff Kevin Rambosk and Bob Finney, the county's director of communication, have been on for much of the past decade.",
      "It's a long way from Feb. 16, 1968, when Alabama's then-House Speaker Rankin Fite made the nation's very first 911 call in Haleyville, Alabama, on a bright red, rotary-style landline telephone. That ceremonial call came just 35 days after AT&T announced plans to use 911 as a nationwide emergency number.",
      "Today, most calls to 911 originate with cellphones, with dispatchers in upgraded centers using geo tracking to get accurate geographic locations from callers.",
      "But the response time in an emergency depends on the type of technology being used at any of the 6,000 emergency communications centers in the U.S. that receive 911 calls. There is no uniform emergency system in the U.S., so individual cities, counties, states or geographic regions are responsible for operating their own 911 call centers.",
      "While some states have fully updated to NG911 systems, others are still using legacy 911 systems that rely on antiquated equipment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just reminded in these last two weeks, with the flooding in Texas, just how important the work of 911 is,\u201d said Michael Martin, CEO of RapidSOS, which provides infrastructure that passes critical data to emergency centers across the United States.",
      "The Collier County Sheriff's Office covers 911 calls from an area of about 2,030 square miles (5,258 square kilometers) that stretches from sandy beaches at the southernmost tip of the Gulf Coast on Florida's peninsula inland to the Everglades.",
      "It's a region that has been ravaged by hurricanes this century, including Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricanes Ian and Milton most recently.",
      "That's why Sheriff Rambosk wanted a high-tech emergency operations center.",
      "\u201cWe just believe that when we can reduce the response time using technology, it will improve safety and survivability of those calling in,\u201d said Rambosk, who has been sheriff since 2009. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what we\u2019re all about, keeping people safe and rescuing them when they need it.\u201d",
      "Today 61 full-time employees and three part-timers staff two emergency operations centers around the clock.",
      "They rely on data that RapidSOS collects from connected buildings, devices, vehicles and even smart watches to send first responders to emergency scenes. The baseline data is provide free of charge to all 911 centers, Martin said.",
      "As Hurricane Helene was tracking toward north Florida last September, forecasters were predicting it could hit Tallahassee as a major Category 3 storm. Officials in Leon County, which serves the state's Capitol and nearby counties on legacy 911 equipment, reached out to Collier County, some 430 miles (692 kilometers) to the southeast, to see if they could take over emergency calls if the storm knocked their center out.",
      "Helene moved to the east of Tallahassee, but Collier County was prepared to help if needed.",
      "\"Because of the partnership with Rapid SOS, they were able to create a map to where not only did we see our own calls, but we could see exactly where the calls were coming in Tallahassee,\u201d Finney said.",
      "Collier County has also partnered with Charleston, South Carolina, as a backup 911 center. Each region is fully prepared to take on 911 calls for the other in case their emergency system goes down for any reason.",
      "It's a similar story in North Carolina, where legislation in 2017 helped establish funding for a next generation 911 system, said Pokey Harris, who serves as president of the National Association of State 911 Administrators and executive director of the North Carolina 911 Board.",
      "Harris said Hurricane Helene provided validation for the upgraded system by being able to direct 911 calls from areas that were devastated by the storm to other parts of North Carolina that were not affected.",
      "\u201cDuring Helene, if a citizen could reach a dial tone, even though their local 911 center may have been impacted because of infrastructure devastation, another center somewhere in the state could answer their call,\u201d Harris said.",
      "Next Generation 911 systems aren't cheap.",
      "\u201cThere has been no federal funding for 911,\u201d Martin, of RapidSOS said. \u201cIt has been in various draft formats as long as I\u2019ve been doing this and it\u2019s never gotten through Congress.\u201d",
      "There is also no federal oversight of 911, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really quite remarkable how well 911 works despite those challenges,\" Martin said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a testament to the people of 911, not the technology.\u201d",

The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.",

      "Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast",
      "WASHINGTON -- Inflation likely accelerated in June as sweeping tariffs on nearly all imports may have pushed up prices for electronics, appliances, and other goods, economists forecast.",
      "Consumer prices probably rose 2.6% last month from a year ago, up from an annual increase of 2.4% in May, according to data provider FactSet. The Labor Department will issue its inflation report at 8:30 a.m. eastern. On a monthly basis, prices likely rose 0.3% from May to June, the largest increase since January, economists project.",
      "Worsening inflation could pose a political challenge for President Donald Trump, who promised during last year's presidential campaign to immediately lower costs. The sharp inflation spike of 2022-2023 was the worst in four decades and soured most Americans on former president Joe Biden's handling of the economy.",
      "Faster price increases would also likely underscore the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut its short-term interest rate, as Trump is loudly demanding.",
      "Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, inflation is forecast to have risen 3% in June from a year earlier, up from a 2.8% rise in May. On a monthly basis, it is also expected to have picked up 0.3% from May to June, according to FactSet. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better sense of where inflation is headed.",
      "Trump has imposed sweeping duties of 10% on all imports, plus 50% levies on steel and aluminum, 30% on goods from China, and 25% on imported cars. Just last week the president threatened to hit the European Union with a new 30% tariff starting Aug. 1.",
      "So far, the tariffs haven't noticeably pushed up inflation, which has been mild for the past four months. Core inflation has fallen from 3.3% in January to 2.8% in May, though that is still above the Fed's 2% target. If inflation in June is much weaker than economists forecast, Trump will likely renew his demands that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell immediately reduce borrowing costs.",
      "Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized that they want to see how the economy evolves as the tariffs take effect before cutting their key short-term rate. The Fed chair has said that the duties could both push up prices and slow the economy, a tricky combination for the central bank since higher costs would typically lead the Fed to hike rates while a weaker economy often spurs it to reduce them.",
      "Trump on Monday said that Powell has been \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s doing.\u201d The president added that the economy was doing well despite Powell\u2019s refusal to reduce rates, but it would be \u201cnice\u201d if there were rate cuts \u201cbecause people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.\u201d",
      "Last week, White House officials also attacked Powell for cost overruns on the years-long renovation of two Fed buildings, which are now slated to cost $2.5 billion, roughly one-third more than originally budgeted. While Trump legally can't fire Powell just because he disagrees with his interest rate decisions, the Supreme Court has signaled, he may be able to do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d such as misconduct or mismanagement.",
      "While inflation was mild in May, there were already signs in last month's report that tariffs were starting to have some impact. The cost of furniture, appliances, toys, and tools rose, though those increases were offset by falling prices for airfares, hotels, and muted rises in rental costs.",
      "Some companies have said they have or plan to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, including Walmart, the world's largest retailer. Automaker Mitsubishi said last month that it was lifting prices by an average of 2.1% in response to the duties, and Nike has said it would implement \u201csurgical\u201d price hikes to offset tariff costs.",
      "But many companies have been able to postpone or avoid price increases, after building up their stockpiles of goods this spring to get ahead of the duties. Other companies may have refrained from lifting prices while they wait to see whether the U.S. is able to reach trade deals with other countries that lower the duties.",

He\u2019s getting everybody fired up. You don\u2019t see that from Sunday through Friday, just Saturday.\u201d",
      "Lebby has nowhere to go but up after a winless conference season and a 2-10 overall record in 2024. Part of Mississippi State\u2019s struggles last season spiraled from Shapen\u2019s injury. The Baylor transfer fractured his right scapula in week four and the Bulldogs went 1-7 in his absence.",
      "\u201cI am 100% healthy,\u201d Shapen said. \u201cObviously it was tough not playing last year, but I\u2019m back now and I feel better than ever.\u201d",
      "Shapen threw eight touchdowns and only one interception with 974 passing yards in his limited sample size, creating some belief his return combined with an extra year of experience in Lebby\u2019s offense can help the Bulldogs in 2025.",
      "\u201cInside our walls right now we have great belief,\u201d Lebby said. \u201cOur guys are incredibly intent on getting better and changing the outcome this fall.\u201d",

      "Kalen DeBoer is looking to restore Alabama as one of the nation's top college football teams",
      "ATLANTA -- Four years without a national championship feels like a severe drought for veteran Alabama players.",
      "Similarly, one year of missing the College Football Playoff has second-year coach Kalen DeBoer feeling the pressure to restore the Crimson Tide's status as one of the nation's top teams in 2025.",
      "When asked Wednesday at the Southeastern Conference media days if a 9-4 finish in his 2024 debut season met the Alabama standard, DeBoer said: \u201cI mean, if you internally ask us, no. We fell short of making the playoffs. It\u2019s as simple as that, right? Giving yourself a chance to go compete for a championship.\u201d",
      "DeBoer's task is especially difficult because he's the coach who followed Nick Saban, who led Alabama to its last national championship in 2020. It was Alabama's sixth championship under Saban since 2009.",
      "Junior offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor said Wednesday the Crimson Tide players have endured a painful wait to reach the standard set by Saban.",
      "\u201cFor the whole team honestly we obviously know that we haven\u2019t won a championship in a long time,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s everybody\u2019s goal at the end of the season.\u201d",
      "Included in Alabama's 9-4 season under DeBoer was a 5-3 SEC mark that included road losses at Vanderbilt, Tennessee and Oklahoma. Alabama was No. 17 in the final AP Top 25 following a 19-13 loss to Michigan in the ReliaQuest Bowl in Tampa, Florida.",
      "DeBoer, who coached the 2023 Washington team to the national championship game, says added familiarity and continuity on his staff are reasons to expect improvement.",
      "Defensive lineman Tim Keenan said another reason the Crimson Tide will be better is players believe in DeBoer. Keenan hinted the shadow of Saban followed DeBoer in 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed,\" Keenan said. \u201cYou definitely see guys definitely bought in. If they\u2019re not here, no knock to them, but everyone who is here now, they believe in the system. They believe in Coach DeBoer.\u201d",
      "Ryan Grubb, who worked on DeBoer's staff at Washington, was hired as Alabama's offensive coordinator after one season with the Seattle Seahawks.",
      "Keenan said he respects DeBoer for having the confidence to follow Saban.",
      "\u201cI know a lot of people say they want to do that, but they ain\u2019t got the courage enough to do it,\u201d Keenan said. \"So I\u2019m gonna go hard for my coach, always.",
      "\u201cJust, you know it\u2019s Coach Saban, like the greatest coach of all time. The GOAT. You know, greatest of all time. So to take that responsibility, saying. \u2018I\u2019m going to take over for him now.\u2019 ... I believe in him. And also, I know that God was going to put the right person in the right place at the right time, and he\u2019s in the right place at the right time.\u201d",
      "DeBoer said Alabama \u201cfell short\u201d last season.",
      "\u201cWe've got to be better in the big moments,\u201d DeBoer said. \"We lost some close games last year. We had chances maybe not even in the fourth quarter, but early in the game to separate ourselves or make a play here or there. Whether it was the belief or whether it was the confidence, a lot of that just comes through repetitions. We really had a great offseason understanding where we fell short, why we fell short. Not just the what and the how but the why.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited about our guys taking those next steps, understanding when we get in those moments this year, those critical times, how to come through and make the play that\u2019s necessary to go win football games.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The oldest championship in golf always brings out something new",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- The crowds following Rory McIlroy for three days at Royal Portrush have been enormous, a reminder of the expectations. On banners and flags and buntings of grandstands there are images of the claret jug, a reminder of what's at stake at the British Open.",
      "But add this to the list of what makes golf's oldest championship so distinct from the other majors: Every year it feels like a new experience.",
      "Justin Thomas contemplated that Wednesday when he finished up his third day playing the course, a practice schedule that is never this full at any other major.",
      "\u201cI came to the realization the last couple of years that playing is better, because your ball goes into weird places,\u201d he said. \"I can go out and chip all day, and get used to the turf and the speed of the greens. But the more you play, the more shots you're hitting in places where you never would in practice.",
      "\u201cYou get out here in a different wind and it can be, \u2018Wow, I didn\u2019t think I'd be here.'\u201d",
      "There is another element to this major that stands out from the U.S. Open and PGA Championship. Amid the nerves and the pressure of a major is the true joy of playing links golf.",
      "\u201cI feel like I'm learning more and more each time I come over here,\u201d said Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player who is in his fifth British Open. \"Each golf course is different, too. Irish links so far is quite a bit different than Scottish links. It's a bit greener over here. You have to play more shots in the air. ... There's a lot of different shots you have to play.",
      "\u201cIt's an interesting course,\" he said. \"And from what I've seen, it seems to be really fun to play and very fair.\u201d",
      "Fair is a loose word in these parts, with all of the humps and crazy bounces, with pot bunkers to be avoided on so many shots, with a hole like the par-3 16th known as \u201cCalamity Corner\u201d that lives up to the name by looks alone.",
      "McIlroy isn't sure he got a fair deal in 2019 when his opening tee shot went left, normally not a big deal except at Royal Portrush there is internal out of bounds, and McIlroy went just beyond the stakes, which sent him into a downward spiral \u2014 a quadruple bogey, a 79 and a short week.",
      "He did not return to the Portrush links in his native Northern Ireland until Monday morning, and then he was out playing all three days of practice.",
      "\u201cI have a real appreciation for how well bunkered it is off the tee,\u201d McIlroy said. \"It's like, \u2018OK, I can't hit 2-iron off the tee, but that brings this bunker into play. But then if I hit driver, it\u2019ll bring in this bunker.' So you have to take on the shot.",
      "\u201cSome courses that we go to in the Open rota, you can just take the bunkers out of play,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, there's always one bunker or another bunker in play. So I think off the tee, it provides a very, very good test.\u201d",
      "McIlroy was among those who felt refreshed when he finished the meat of the PGA Tour season \u2014 five signature events, The Players Championship, three majors, all in a span of three months \u2014 and arrived in the United Kingdom. The scenery, the temperature, the brand of golf, all of it felt so new, almost like he was starting a new season.",
      "Thomas felt the same way. There is a buzz in the heavy, seaside air off the North Atlantic, no matter how stiff the challenge and how much the weather changes.",
      "The forecast? It's generally been referred to as \u201cmixed,\u201d which in these parts tends to mean it changes without notice. The final day of practice was sunshine and breezy.",
      "Thomas was playing the 16th while his father showed video of them watching in the final round in 2019, wind and rain ripping so hard that umbrellas were useless.",
      "Thomas remembers standing on the 17th tee and calling over a rules official to ask if they were meant to be playing. He wanted to hit 3-wood off the tee, but it was 209 yards to the fairway and the wind was so strong he didn't think he could get there. So he went with driver, hit some 75 yards off line and made triple bogey.",
      "On his final day of practice, with sunshine and a helping wind, he hit a mini-driver that would have stopped near the front of the green on the 409-yard hole if it hadn't found a bunker.",
      "This is what he loves about links golf.",
      "\u201cNot only do the holes change, how easy or hard they are, your lines off the tee can change,\u201d he said \u201cYou have elevation. You're never writing \u2018uphill\u2019 or \u2018downhill\u2019 in the yardage book like you are at an Open Championship. You have a game plan, but you really can't until you're out there and whatever the weather is giving you.\"",
      "Thomas looked back on the 18th green before going to sign autographs for a group of children.",
      "\u201cIf I could only play one course the rest of my life it would be links,\u201d Thomas said. \"Because you could play the same course every day for a month and get something different.",
      "\u201cI love The Open. Every time I've played it, I love the tournament more and more,\u201d he said. \u201cI really want to have a chance to win the tournament and walk up the 18th hole. Seems like it would be the coolest thing in the world.\u201d",

      "Atletico Madrid has signed American midfielder Johnny Cardoso from Real Betis on a five-year contract",
      "MADRID -- Atletico Madrid continues to boost its squad for next season, signing young American midfielder Johnny Cardoso from Real Betis.",
      "The 23-year-old Cardoso arrived on a five-year contract, Atletico said Wednesday.",
      "Cardoso was born in the United States but is of Brazilian descent and has an Italian passport, meaning he doesn't occupy a non-European Union slot in Diego Simeone's squad.",
      "The holding midfielder played in Brazil until moving to Betis in the 2023-24 season, where he became an important player for Manuel Pellegrini's team.",
      "Cardoso made his senior debut for the United States in a match against Wales in 2020. He has 22 caps, winning the CONCACAF Nations League in 2023 and 2024.",
      "Cardoso had to withdraw from Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s CONCACAF Nations League squad in March due to a muscle injury.",
      "Atletico on Tuesday reached an agreement to sign 24-year-old Argentina international Thiago Almada from Brazilian club Botafogo.",
      "It previously had boosted its squad by signing midfielder \u00c1lex Baena from Villarreal and 22-year-old Italian left back Matteo Ruggeri from Atalanta.",
      "Simeone\u2019s team finished third in the Spanish league last season, behind Real Madrid and champion Barcelona. It was eliminated in the group stage of the Club World Cup.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Indiana Fever might be without star guard Caitlin Clark again for a bit after she injured her groin Tuesday night late in a win over the Connecticut Sun.",
      "It will be a busy week for the league's young star if she can play. Clark and the Fever visit New York on Wednesday night in the second half of a back-to-back and Indiana hosts the All-Star Game this weekend. Clark is set to compete in a loaded 3-point contest Friday night and is captain of one of the All-Star teams.",
      "\u201cNo update. Just felt a little something in her groin,\u201d Fever coach Stephanie White said after an 85-77 victory over the Sun in Boston. \u201cWe\u2019ll get it evaluated and see what happens from there.\u201d",
      "Clark got hurt with under a minute left when she walked downcourt holding her right groin after assisting on the Fever\u2019s final basket. As teammate Aliyah Boston tried to console her, Clark walked to the basket stanchion and banged her head against it before heading to the bench. During the timeout, she covered her head with a towel and appeared to be holding back tears.",
      "Clark had been durable throughout college and her first season in the WNBA, never missing a game. Now she's had four different muscle injuries so far this year.",
      "She missed the preseason opener with tightness in her quad but played the next day in an exhibition game at her alma mater, Iowa. She suffered a quad strain against New York on May 24 that kept her out for five games. Clark returned on June 14 and played in five games before suffering another injury to her left groin that kept her out for four contests and the Commissioner's Cup final.",
      "The Fever canceled shootaround Wednesday morning in New York, a common practice when a team is playing back-to-back games.",
      "\u201cI think we just take it one step at a time. We\u2019ll get some food, get on the plane and start talking about New York,\" White said. \"She\u2019s being evaluated, we\u2019ll see where we are with that, and certainly we\u2019ll have another evaluation, probably in conversation in the morning, and see where we are. But, you know, this group has played without her, we\u2019ve at least got experience in that. We know that we have a tough opponent in New York, and we know it\u2019s going to be a challenge no matter what.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's links course at Turnberry has not been taken off the British Open rotation",
      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- President Donald Trump is not getting a British Open to the Turnberry course he owns in the near future, an issue the R&A's new chief executive said Wednesday was more about transportation than politics.",
      "Turnberry is regarded as the most beautiful of the links on the Open rotation, set along the Ayrshire coast in Scotland across from the Ailsa Craig. It last hosted the Open in 2009, before Trump bought the resort.",
      "Mark Darbon, who took over at the R&A this year from Martin Slumbers, said Turnberry had not been taken off the list of potential British Open sites, but transportation and other issues had to be addressed.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve been extremely clear on our position in respect of Turnberry. We love the golf course but we\u2019ve got some big logistical challenges there,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see the scale of their setup here and we\u2019ve got some work to do on the road, rail and accommodation infrastructure around Turnberry.\u201d",
      "Darbon said the R&A met with Eric Trump and other leaders of Trump Golf a few months ago and the talks had been constructive.",
      "\u201cI think they understand clearly where we\u2019re coming from. We talked through some of the challenges that we have so we\u2019ve got a good dialogue with them,\u201d he said.",
      "Slumbers had previously said the R&A would not be going to Turnberry until it was comfortable the topic would be about golf and not the owner.",
      "Turnberry has only hosted the British Open four times, first in 1977 with the famous \u201cDuel in the Sun\u201d when Tom Watson beat Jack Nicklaus. But the Open is getting bigger, and the roads are limited getting to Turnberry.",
      "There has been speculation Trump, whose golf courses have never hosted a men's major, might ask the British government to intercede in getting the Open back to Turnberry.",
      "\u201cWe have an ongoing dialogue with the UK government given that we\u2019re a major event that creates significant value into the UK economy,\u201d Darbon said. \"We've spoken to them specifically about Turnberry and I think they\u2019ve made it clear that the decision around where we take our championship rests with us.",
      "\u201cI would find it difficult to predict whether there will be any discussion on The Open if the President is making a visit here.\u201d",
      "Turnberry is not the only Scottish links being ignored by the R&A. Muirfield, located along the Firth of Forth east of Edinburgh, is reputed to be the purest of links courses. Its first Open was in 1892, and there have been 15 others, most recently in 2013 won by Phil Mickelson.",
      "Only St. Andrews has hosted more Opens than Muirfield.",
      "But it has not been back there since 2013 as the R&A has been geared toward taking golf's oldest championship to courses that can hold big crowds. It is expected 278,000 spectators will be at Royal Portrush this week, the second-largest behind St. Andrews. The last Open at Muirfield had 142,000 spectators.",
      "The Open will be at Royal Birkdale next year, and then St. Andrews in 2027. The site for 2028 has not been announced. Muirfield has never gone more than 11 years \u2014 except for interruptions from World War I and World War II \u2014 between Opens.",
      "\u201cWe love the golf course at Muirfield. We\u2019re in a discussion with the venue right now,\u201d Darbon said. \"There\u2019s some things that we need to evolve at Muirfield \u2014 the practice ground in particular is a challenge for us with a modern Open and there\u2019s some work we need to do with the venue to facilitate some of the infrastructure that we require.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s a good dialogue and we\u2019d love to be back there in the future.\u201d",

      "USA Bobsled and Skeleton has entered into a multi-year endorsement deal with American Honda, one that will give the sliding sports federation financial and technical support going into both next winter's Milan-Cortina Olympics and the 2030 Games in the French Alps.",
      "The deal, announced Wednesday, has been in the works for some time. Honda \u2014 which becomes the official premier technology partner of the teams \u2014 will give USABS, among other things, access to its wind tunnel in Ohio for research and development purposes.",
      "Such access is crucial when determining optimal sled positioning and other aerodynamic factors in sports where one-hundredth of a second can be the difference between winning and losing. Eventually, the partnership will evolve into sled design as well.",
      "\u201cLong term, they\u2019ll be playing a role in helping us design bobsleds,\" USABS CEO Aron McGuire told The Associated Press. \"We'll be looking at building four-man sleds initially. They will be providing the aerodynamic expertise and providing us insights, recommendations, into how we can best design a sled as it relates to other factors, like safety of the athletes sitting in the sled and the performance side of the design.\u201d",
      "The teams will also have Acura logos on their sleds for all competitions through the 2030 Games.",
      "\u201cIn sports where sleds can reach speeds of over 90 miles per hour and the difference between first and last can be measured in fractions of a second, our Honda engineers are eager to apply their engineering skills and racing background to the USABS programs,\" said Larry Geise, the executive vice president of Honda Development & Manufacturing of America.",
      "Financial specifics were not disclosed, but the deal is one of the more significant in USABS history.",
      "\u201cIt's at the top of the cash partners that we've had,\u201d McGuire said.",
      "The news comes at a key time for the programs, with the next Olympics just seven months away. The U.S. has legitimate medal hopes in bobsled and skeleton going into Milan-Cortina; Kaysha Love is the reigning women's monobob champion, women's pilots Kaillie Humphries Armbruster and Elana Meyers Taylor are the two most decorated female drivers in Olympic history, and the American duo of Austin Florian and Mystique Ro won a gold medal in the new mixed team skeleton discipline at the world championships earlier this year.",

      "OAKMONT, Pa. -- Former U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark won't be allowed back at Oakmont Country Club until he pays to fix the locker he damaged and gets counseling for his anger.",
      "Golf Digest obtained a letter that club president John Lynch sent to Oakmont members this week about the incident during last month's U.S. Open, when Clark smashed up his locker out of frustration. Media were not allowed in the locker room, but a photo was leaked and went viral.",
      "\u201cFollowing multiple discussions with the USGA and the OCC Board, a decision has been made that Mr. Clark will no longer be permitted on OCC property,\u201d Lynch said in the letter.",
      "\u201cReinstatement would be contingent upon Mr. Clark fulfilling a number of specific conditions, including full repayment for damages, a meaningful contribution to a charity of the Board\u2019s choosing, and the successful completion of counseling and/or anger management sessions.\u201d",
      "Clark received a 10-year exemption for winning the U.S. Open at Los Angeles Country Club in 2023. The exemption ends in 2033, the next time Oakmont is to host the U.S. Open. The storied club has held the U.S. Open nine times, the most of any U.S. Open site.",

      "Clark, who reached as high as No. 3 in the world last year, has only one top 10 on the PGA Tour in the 2025 season. He has dropped to No. 28 in the world, No. 22 in the Ryder Cup standings and at No. 78 in the FedEx Cup is in danger of missing the postseason.",

      "Soccer faces growing challenges from extreme heat, as seen during the FIFA Club World Cup in the U.S. this summer",
      "GENEVA -- Soccer had a fierce reckoning with heat at the recently concluded FIFA Club World Cup in the United States \u2014 a sweltering preview of what players and fans may face when the U.S. co-hosts the World Cup with Mexico and Canada next summer.",
      "With temperatures rising worldwide, scientists warn that staging the World Cup and other soccer tournaments in the Northern Hemisphere summer is getting increasingly dangerous for both players and spectators. Some suggest that FIFA may have to consider adjusting the soccer calendar to reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe deeper we go in the decade, the greater the risk without considering more dramatic measures, such as playing in the winter months and/or cooler latitudes,\u201d said Prof. Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures in Leeds, England. \u201cI\u2019m getting increasingly worried that we are only one heatwave away from a sporting tragedy and I would like to see governing bodies lean into the climate and health science.\u201d",
      "Tournament soccer in June and July is a tradition going back to the first World Cup in 1930.",
      "Since then, the three-month period of June, July and August globally has warmed by 1.05 degrees Celsius (1.89 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Meanwhile, European summer temperatures have increased by 1.81 degrees C. The rate of warming has accelerated since the 1990's.",
      "Climate scientists say that\u2019s a factor that needs to be considered when playing high-intensity outdoor sports like soccer.",
      "\u201cIf you want to play football for 10 hours a day, they\u2019ll have to be the hours of the early morning and late evening,\u201d climatologist Friederike Otto from Imperial College, London, told The Associated Press in an email, \u201cif you don\u2019t want to have players and fans die from heatstroke or get severely ill with heat exhaustion.\u201d",
      "Extreme heat and thunderstorms made an impact on FIFA's newly expanded tournament for club teams. The Club World Cup was held in 11 American cities from June 14 to July 13.",
      "FIFA adapted by tweaking its extreme heat protocol to include extra breaks in play, more field-side water, and cooling the team benches with air fans and more shade.",
      "Still, Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez said the heat made him dizzy and urged FIFA to avoid afternoon kickoffs at the World Cup next year.",
      "The global soccer players union, FIFPRO, has warned that six of the 16 World Cup cities next year are at \u201cextremely high risk\u201d for heat stress.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino addressed the heat concerns on Saturday, saying the handful of World Cup stadiums that are covered would be used for day-time games next year.",
      "Extreme heat could become an even bigger challenge at the following World Cup in 2030, which will be co-hosted by Spain, Portugal and Morocco. Games are scheduled to be played in afternoons and early evenings from mid-June to mid-July. All three countries have already seen temperatures rise above 40 degrees C (well above 100 Fahrenheit) this summer.",
      "FIFA downplayed the heat risk in its in-house evaluation of the 2030 World Cup bid, saying \u201cweather conditions are difficult to predict with the current development in global and local climate, but are unlikely to affect the health of players or other participants.\u201d",
      "The physical effects of playing 90 minutes of soccer in direct sunshine during the hottest part of the day can be severe and potentially result in hyperthermia \u2013 abnormally high body temperatures.",
      "\u201cWhen players experience hyperthermia, they also experience an increase in cardiovascular strain,\u201d said Julien P\u00e9riard of the University of Canberra.",
      "\u201cIf core temperature increases excessively, exertional heat illness can occur,\u201d leading to muscle cramping, heat exhaustion, and even life-threatening heat stroke, he said.",
      "Many sports events held in the summer adjust their start times to early morning or late night to minimize the risk heat-related illness, including marathons at the Olympics  or track world championships. Morning kickoffs, however, are rare in soccer, where World Cup match schedules are often set with European TV audiences in mind.",
      "It would be hard for FIFA to avoid day-time World Cup kickoffs given the packed match schedule as the number of participating teams increases from 32 to 48 in 2026.",
      "Heat mainly becomes an issue when the World Cup is held in the Northern Hemisphere, because June and July are winter months in the Southern Hemisphere.",
      "FIFA has stuck to its traditional June-July schedule for the men\u2019s World Cup except in 2022 when it moved the tournament to November-December to avoid the summer heat in Qatar. Something similar is expected when neighboring Saudi Arabia hosts the tournament in 2034.",
      "However, moving the World Cup to another part of the year is complicated because it means Europe\u2019s powerful soccer leagues must interrupt their season, affecting both domestic leagues and the Champions League.",
      "FIFA didn\u2019t respond to questions from AP about whether alternate dates for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups were being considered.",
      "When and where to schedule the World Cup and other outdoor sports events is likely to become more pressing as the world continues to warm.",
      "Athletes and even everyday people doing basic physical activities are now exposed to 28% more of moderate or higher heat risk in 2023 than they were in the 1990s, said Ollie Jay, a professor at the University of Sydney who has helped shape policy for the Australian Open in tennis.",
      "\u201cThis is symbolic of something bigger,\u201d said Michael Mann, a University of Pennsylvania climate scientist. \u201cNot just the danger and inconvenience to fans and players, but the fundamentally disruptive nature of climate change when it comes our current way of life.\u201d",

      "The NBA may finally be one step closer on the long road to expansion",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The NBA may finally be one step closer on the long road to expansion.",
      "Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that the league has been tasked by team owners to study the issue more formally as part of in-depth analysis, which would be the first official move in a long process toward adding franchises.",
      "There's no timetable about how long the process will take, nor have any decisions been made on what the expansion fee will be, when the new teams will start play \u2014 or even if expansion is going to actually happen.",
      "The league isn't creating a new committee to study expansion; the duties, for now, will fall primarily to a pair of existing groups, with the advisory finance committee leading and the audit and strategy committee also involved.",
      "\u201cA lot of analysis still needs to be done and nothing has been predetermined,\u201d Silver said.",
      "The decision to take a harder look at expansion wasn\u2019t totally unexpected, since the notion of adding clubs has been a talking point for several years. Cities like Las Vegas and Seattle \u2014 long perceived to be the front-runners should the NBA decide to expand past its current 30-team footprint \u2014 will surely continue to push to be the eventual picks. And Silver himself has said previously that he expects expansion will happen at some point.",
      "\u201cI think there is a significant step now in that we are now engaging in this in-depth analysis, something we weren\u2019t prepared to do before,\" Silver said. \"But beyond that, it\u2019s really Day 1 of that in-depth analysis. And so, in terms of price, potential timing, it\u2019s too early to say. ... It is truly a complicated issue.\u201d",
      "The next board of governors meeting will likely take place sometime in September.",
      "Expansion has long been a difficult issue, since it\u2019ll mean, among other things, that the current owners will have decided to sell equity in a league that is on a financial roll right now.",
      "\u201cFor every team you add, you're diluting the economics of the current league,\u201d Silver said.",
      "A new series of media rights deals worth $76 billion kicks in for this coming season, franchise values across the league have soared and the two most title-laden franchises in the NBA, the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, clubs that have combined for about half of the titles handed out in league history, are in the process of being sold with a combined valuation of at least $16.1 billion.",
      "The Celtics are being sold to private equity mogul Bill Chisholm with a valuation of at least $6.1 billion, which was a record until the Buss family agreed to sell the Lakers to businessman Mark Walter \u2014 also the owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers \u2014 with a valuation of $10 billion.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that those purchase prices have an impact on any economic analysis of teams, so it doesn\u2019t necessarily complicate it more, but it certainly is an indication of value,\" Silver said. \u201cAnd one other factor we have to look at: we\u2019re trying to think what is the value of expansion, what does it mean to dilute the existing equity, and how additive is this potentially to the league by adding an additional team.\u201d",
      "The league has added seven franchises since 1988, but none since 2004. There has been several instances of rebranding and relocating since \u2014 most notably, the Seattle SuperSonics moving to Oklahoma City in 2008 and becoming the Thunder \u2014 but the league has been at 30 teams for the past two decades.",

      "The Fire and the Thorns will share a new joint-training facility in the first such partnership between the two women's leagues.",
      "The Fire have already sold more than 11,000 season tickets, surpassing the WNBA's previous best. The team will play at the Moda Center, where the original Fire averaged some 8,000 fans a game.",

      "The Toronto Tempo, meanwhile, announced a team name back in December and have already hired a general manager.",
      "Hamill, a former Nike executive, took over for Son until a permanent president can be found. She said the launch of the team name and logo is just a slice of what the team is activating on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe're pointing everybody to the launch and the pace at which we're moving, and just giving everyone confidence that we have our arms around it,\u201d Hamill said. \u201cWe're moving fast, and you're going to hear from us a lot.\"",

      "Fauja Singh, known as the Turbaned Torpedo and believed to be the world\u2019s oldest marathon runner, has died at 114 after being hit by a car in India",
      "LONDON -- Fauja Singh, an Indian-born runner nicknamed the Turbaned Torpedo who was believed to be the world\u2019s oldest marathon runner, has died after being hit by a car. He was 114.",
      "Local media in India reported that Singh sustained severe head injuries in a hit-and-run accident on Monday while he was crossing the road at his native village near Jalandhar in Punjab. He was taken to the hospital where he later died. His London-based running club and charity, Sikhs In The City, confirmed his death.",
      "India\u2019s Prime minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh, saying he was \u201cextraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness.\u201d",
      "Singh became the oldest man to run a full marathon in 2011 at the age of 100 in Toronto. His accomplishment was not recognized by Guinness World Records because he did not have a birth certificate to prove his age. Singh had a British passport that showed his date of birth as April 1, 1911, while a letter from Indian government officials stated that birth records were not kept in 1911.",
      "A torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics, Singh took up running at the age of 89 as a way to get over depression after his wife and son died in quick succession in India. The death in 1994 of his son took a particularly hard toll on him because of its grisly nature.",
      "Singh and his son, Kuldip, both farmers, were checking on their fields in the middle of a storm when a piece of corrugated metal blown by the wind decapitated Kuldip in front of his father\u2019s eyes.",
      "Singh, whose five other children had emigrated, was left all alone.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t think his life was worth living without his son\u201d following the traumatic incident, his coach Harmander Singh said.",
      "He went to live with his youngest son in London. That\u2019s where sports enthusiast Singh attended tournaments organized by the Sikh community and took part in sprints. He met some Sikh marathon runners who encouraged him to take up long-distance running. One day he saw a marathon on television for the first time and decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do.",
      "At the age of 89 in 2000 he ran the London Marathon, his first, and went on to do eight more. His best time was 5 hours and 40 minutes at the 2003 Toronto Marathon.",
      "\u201cFrom a tragedy has come a lot of success and happiness,\u201d Singh said.",
      "Singh ran his last competitive race in 2013 at the age of 101, finishing the Hong Kong Marathon\u2019s 10-kilometer (6.25-mile) race in 1 hour, 32 minutes, 28 seconds.",
      "Following his retirement from racing, he said he hoped \u201cpeople will remember me and not forget me.\u201d He also wanted people to continue to invite him to events \u201crather than forget me altogether just because I don\u2019t run anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was an exceptional athlete with incredible determination,\u201d Modi said. \u201cPained by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and countless admirers around the world.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires.",
      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

      "The new College Sports Commission sent a letter to athletic directors last week saying it was rejecting deals in which players were receiving money from collectives that were created solely to pay them and don't provide goods or services to the general public for profit.",
      "A lead attorney for the players responded by saying those instructions went against settlement terms and asking the CSC to rescind the guidance.",
      "\u201cThis process is undermined when the CSC goes off the reservation and issues directions to the schools that are not consistent with the Settlement Agreement terms,\u201d attorney Jeffrey Kessler wrote to NCAA outside counsel Rakesh Kilaru in a letter obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Yahoo Sports first reported details of the letter, in which Kessler threatens to take the issue to a judge assigned with resolving disputes involved in the settlement.",
      "Kessler told the AP that his firm was not commenting on the contents of the letter, and Kilaru did not immediately respond to the AP's request for comment.",
      "Yahoo quoted a CSC spokesman as saying the parties are working to resolve differences and that \"the guidance issued by the College Sports Commission ... is entirely consistent with the House settlement and the rules that have been agreed upon with class counsel.\u201d",
      "When NIL payments became allowed in 2021, boosters formed so-called collectives that were closely tied to universities to work out contracts with the players, who still weren't allowed to be paid directly by the schools.",
      "Terms of the House settlement allow schools to make the payments now but keep the idea of outside payments from collectives, which have to be approved by the CSC if they are worth $600 or more.",
      "The CSC, in its letter last week, explained that if a collective reaches a deal, for instance, for an athlete to appear on behalf of the collective, which charges an admission fee, that collective does not have a \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d because the purpose of the event is to raise money to pay athletes, not to provide goods or services available to the general public for profit.",
      "Another example of a disallowed deal was one an athlete makes to sell merchandise to raise money to pay that player because, the CSC guidance said, the purpose of \u201cselling merchandise is to raise money to pay that student-athlete and potentially other student-athletes at a particular school or schools, which is not a valid business purpose.\"",
      "Kessler's letter notes that the \u201cvalid business purpose\u201d rule was designed to ensure athletes were not simply being paid to play, and did not prohibit NIL collectives from paying athletes for the type of deals described above.",
      "To prevent those payments \u201cwould be to create a new prohibition on payments by a NIL collective that is not provided for or contemplated by the Settlement Agreement, causing injury to the class members who should be free to receive those payments,\" Kessler wrote.",

      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",
      "\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,\u201d he said.",
      "For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.",
      "If there are more stubborn spots \u2014 like food stains or sneezy spatters \u2014 dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar.",
      "Computer maker Lenovo says the \u201cgentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.\u201d Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.",
      "A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup.",
      "If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth.",
      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",
      "Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water \u2014 typically used as a facial cleanser.",
      "Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours.",
      "To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them.",
      "Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup.",
      "They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with.",
      "Both companies say it\u2019s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide.",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says export controls on advanced chips require companies to adapt",
      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
      "Hunting with a sponge on their face interferes with bottlenose dolphins\u2019 finely tuned sense of echolocation, of emitting sounds and listening for echoes to navigate.",
      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",
      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",

      "The first astronauts in more than 40 years from India, Poland and Hungary are back on Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private spaceflight featuring the first astronauts in more than 40 years from India, Poland and Hungary came to a close Tuesday with a Pacific splashdown.",
      "Their SpaceX capsule undocked from the I nternational Space Station on Monday and parachuted into the ocean off the Southern California coast, less than 24 hours later.",
      "The crew of four launched nearly three weeks ago on a flight chartered by the Houston company Axiom Space.",
      "Axiom's Peggy Whitson, the most experienced U.S. astronaut, served as commander. Joining her were India's Shubhanshu Shukla, Poland's Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski and Hungary's Tibor Kapu, whose countries paid more than $65 million apiece for the mission.",
      "\u201cThanks for the great ride and safe trip,\u201d Whitson radioed moments after splashdown. Her record now stands at 695 days in space over five missions, longer than any other American or woman.",
      "The visiting astronauts conducted dozens of experiments in orbit while celebrating their heritage. The last time India, Poland and Hungary put anyone in space was during the late 1970s and 1980s, launching with the Soviets. They waved and smiled as they emerged from the capsule, one by one, into the early morning darkness.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth mission to the orbiting outpost since 2022, part of NASA\u2019s ongoing effort to open up space to more businesses and people. The company is one of several developing their own space stations to replace the current one. NASA plans to abandon the outpost in 2030, after more than 30 years of operation.",

      "The news came in a company blog post late Monday and Huang also spoke about the coup on China\u2019s state-run CGTN television network in remarks shown on X.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. government has assured Nvidia that licenses will be granted, and Nvidia hopes to start deliveries soon,\u201d the post said.",
      "\u201cToday, I'm announcing that the U.S. government has approved for us filing licenses to start shipping H20s,\u201d Huang told reporters in Beijing. He noted that half of the world's AI researchers are in China.",
      "\u201cIt's so innovative and dynamic here in China that it's really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market here in China,\u201d he said.",

      "Nvidia has profited enormously from rapid adoption of AI, becoming the first company to have its market value surpass $4 trillion last week. However, the trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the industry.",
      "Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.",
      "In January, before Trump began his second term in office, the administration of President Joe Biden launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.",
      "The White House announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying President Donald Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world\u2019s largest markets for technology.",
      "They've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",

      "Major League Baseball is testing automated ball-strike systems in the All-Star Game for the first time",
      "ATLANTA -- Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires.",
      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect",
      "NEW YORK -- A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.",
      "The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.",
      "Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule.",
      "\u201cNo subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,\" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.",
      "Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges \u2014 including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.",
      "\u201cCompanies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. \u201cPeople should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.",
      "Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free \u2014 or for a fee \u2014 and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.",
      "For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.",
      "The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon\u2019s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.",
      "Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate \u2014 half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.",
      "Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.",
      "The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer\u2019s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.",
      "The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule\u2019s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC\u2019s proposal as part of its \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.",

      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright, former West Virginia U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, and Wyoming's congressional delegation are on the VIP list for a groundbreaking ceremony Friday at the Ramaco Resources, Inc., Brook Mine outside Ranchester in far northern Wyoming.",
      "Rare earth elements are a family of 17 metallic elements with unusual properties that make them useful for specific applications. Neodymium and dysprosium are used in the permanent magnets of wind turbines, lanthanum in electric and hybrid car batteries.",
      "Yttrium and terbium have critical military uses, including in targeting devices.",
      "China supplies almost 90% of the world's rare earths. Concern about continued access to the substances has been a focus of recent negotiations between China and the U.S., and led the Trump administration to try to encourage more production domestically.",
      "Rare earths aren't especially rare but so scattered they are difficult to bring together in useful quantities. Currently the only U.S. rare earths mine is at Mountain Pass in California.",
      "Analysis by U.S. national laboratories show the Brook Mine coal contains valuable quantities of the rare earths neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, as well as the critical minerals gallium, scandium and germanium, according to a Ramaco letter to shareholders on July 1.",
      "\u201cWe would intend to mine it here in Wyoming, process it here in Wyoming and sell it to domestic customers including the government,\u201d Ramaco CEO Randall Atkins said Thursday.",
      "Manchin, who left office in January after not seeking re-election, joined the Ramaco board in April.",
      "No new Wyoming coal mine has opened in 50 years. Wyoming's coal industry instead has shrunk substantially since its peak over a decade ago, troubled as utilities switch to renewable energy and power plants fueled by cheaper natural gas.",
      "The Brook Mine, stalled in part by landowners worried about groundwater depletion, has been in the works for over a decade. Atkins originally envisioned it as a source of subbituminous power plant fuel, much like Wyoming's massive open-pit mines that supply about 40% of the nation's coal.",
      "A public company with metallurgical coal mines in Appalachia, Ramaco in recent years received Department of Energy grants to develop coal into carbon-based products such as carbon fiber. This year, it got a $6.1 million grant from Wyoming to build a rare earth and critical minerals processing plant.",
      "A consultant report released this week found that fully developing the mine and processing plant would cost around $500 million, a sum that could be recovered in five years if the rare earths can be extracted and sold. Ramaco also would sell the processed coal as fuel, Atkins said.",

      "A dinosaur fossil has been found in an unlikely place, a hole drilled under the parking lot of a Colorado museum where dinosaur skeletons are on display",
      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone discovery closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",
      "This latest find is not so visually impressive. Even so, the odds of finding the hockey-puck-shaped fossil sample were impressively small.",
      "With a bore only a couple of inches (5 centimeters) wide, museum officials struggled to describe just how unlikely it was to hit a dinosaur, even in a region with a fair number of such fossils.",
      "\u201cFinding a dinosaur bone in a core is like hitting a hole in one from the moon. It\u2019s like winning the Willy Wonka factory. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s super rare,\u201d said James Hagadorn, the museum\u2019s curator of geology.",
      "Only two similar finds have been noted in bore hole samples anywhere in the world, not to mention on the grounds of a dinosaur museum, according to museum officials.",
      "A vertebra of a smallish, plant-eating dinosaur is believed to be the source. It lived in the late Cretaceous period around 67.5 million years ago. An asteroid impact brought the long era of dinosaurs to an end around 66 million years ago, according to scientists.",
      "Fossilized vegetation also was found in the bore hole near the bone.",
      "\u201cThis animal was living in what was probably a swampy environment that would have been heavily vegetated at the time,\u201d said Patrick O'Connor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "Dinosaur discoveries in the area over the years include portions of Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops-type fossils. This one is Denver's deepest and oldest yet, O'Connor said.",
      "Other experts in the field vouched for the find's legitimacy but with mixed reactions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, I guess. Scientifically it\u2019s not that exciting,\u201d said Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque.",
      "There was no way to tell exactly what species of dinosaur it was, Williamson noted.",
      "The find is \"absolutely legit and VERY COOL!\u201d Erin LaCount, director of education programs at the Dinosaur Ridge track site just west of Denver, said by email.",
      "The fossil's shape suggests it was a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, a smaller but somewhat similar species, LaCount noted.",
      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Only about one-quarter of U.S. adults say that President Donald Trump's policies have helped them since he took office, according to a new poll that finds underwhelming marks for him on key issues, including the economy, immigration, government spending and health care.",
      "In fact, the Republican president fails to earn majority approval on any of the issues included in the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. He's even slipped slightly since earlier this year on immigration, which has consistently been a strength for him in his second term.",
      "And while a majority of Americans do see Trump as at least \u201csomewhat\u201d capable of getting things done following the passage of his sprawling budget bill, fewer believe he understands the problems facing people like them.",

About 2 in 10 say his policies have \u201cnot made a difference\u201d in their lives, with about one-quarter saying his policies have \"done more to help\u201d them.",
      "The vast majority of Democrats and about half of independents say Trump\u2019s policies have had a negative impact, while even many Republicans say they haven't seen positive effects.",
      "\u201cAs it sits today, I don\u2019t know his policies have made much of a difference in my day-to-day life,\u201d said Landon Lindemer, a 29-year-old logistics manager from suburban Atlanta who voted for Trump three times.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m not sold it\u2019s really going to help,\" he said.",
      "The mixed reviews on Trump's policies come as he struggles to follow through on key campaign promises, including lowering costs for working-class Americans, preserving popular social welfare programs like Medicaid, ending foreign wars and lowering government spending.",
      "Inflation rose last month to its highest level since February as Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs push up the cost of everything from groceries and clothes to furniture and appliances. Separately, Trump\u2019s budget bill included Medicaid cuts that will lead to 11.8 million more Americans becoming uninsured and add $3.3 trillion to the national debt, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.",
      "At the same time, violent conflicts still rage in Israel and Ukraine.",
      "Overall, the new poll finds that about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump's job performance, a figure that's in line with his June approval but historically weak compared with recent presidents. Closer to half of U.S. adults approved of President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama at roughly the same point in their Democratic presidencies, according to polls from AP-NORC and Gallup, although Biden's approval rating declined in the second half of his first year and remained low for the rest of his time in office.",

      "\u201cIn terms of my day-to-day life, I really haven\u2019t seen a change, except for the general fear and anxiety I feel at a core level,\u201d Neill said.",
      "Trump earned less than 50% approval on every issue included in the new AP-NORC poll, including the economy, government spending, trade, taxes, immigration, health care and his handling of the conflict in the Middle East.",
      "Only 43% of U.S. adults said they approved of his handling of immigration, down slightly from the 49% who supported his work on the issue back in March.",
      "Trump also appears to have lost some support for his spending decisions. About 4 in 10 Americans approve of Trump's handling of government spending, down from 46% in March.",
      "On the economy overall, roughly 4 in 10 adults approve of Trump's performance, which hasn't changed measurably in the last few months.",
      "Timothy Dwyer, of Dyersburg, Tennessee, a 26-year-old self-described independent who works in retail sales and leans Republican, said Trump's work on the economy, especially his tariffs, has \u201creally sucked.\u201d",

      "Most Americans, 56%, say \u201cunderstands the problems facing people like you\u201d is a phrase that describes Trump \u201cnot very well\u201d or \u201cnot well at all.\u201d His numbers on the question are relatively weak even among those in his party: Just about half of Republicans say he understands the problems facing people like them \u201cextremely\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d well.",

      "Cats, dogs and other house pets are easier to keep cool, but pet owners still have to remain vigilant during the summer, Palm Beach County Animal Care and Control spokeswoman Arielle Weinberger said. Just like horses, any cats and dogs kept outside need shade and water.",
      "Officials are especially concerned about pet owners leaving dogs and cats inside vehicles. Local laws might vary throughout the state, but it's illegal to leave animals unattended in vehicles for any amount of time in Palm Beach County, Weinberger said. During hot weather, she said the temperature inside a vehicle can increase 20 degrees in just 10 minutes.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure that no animals are left unattended, and that includes even if the window is cracked, even if the A/C is on,\u201d Weinberger said. \u201cAnimals cannot be unattended in a vehicle, it is for their safety.\u201d",
      "Dog owners especially need to check pavement, Weinberger said. Concrete and asphalt can reach temperatures of up to 125 degrees (52 degrees) during the summer months, so finding grass or dirt for pets to walk on is ideal. If that's not practical, pet owners might need to invest in booties or paw wax.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too hot for you to touch with a bare foot or a bare hand, it\u2019s too hot for your pets, as well,\u201d Weinberger said.",
      "People who don't actually own pets can also help to keep animals safe, whether it's community cats or local wildlife, by leaving water outside, Weinberger said. Animal control officers will respond to pets and livestock suffering from signs of dehydration or heat stroke, but Weinberger said residents should call local wildlife rescue facilities if they see a raccoon or other wild animal in bad shape.",
      "If an animal seems overheated, it can be cooled down with water on their head, stomach and feet. But if they start to experience symptoms like diarrhea, lethargy, dizziness and vomiting, it's time to seek medical attention, Weinberger said.",
      "\u201cWe want to take them to the vet as soon as possible, because heat stroke can lead to organ failure, and we want to make sure that it doesn\u2019t get to that,\u201d Weinberger said.",
      "Matthew Puodziukaitis, 19, of Wellington, regularly brings his mini goldendoodle, Hazel, to the Okeeheelee Park dog area. He said he always brings a bottle of cold water and a bowl for Hazel and any other dogs who might need it.",
      "\"The last thing you want is a dog passing out or something bad happening to them out here,\" Puodziukaitis said. \u201cThey\u2019re basically like a little kid. You want to make sure they\u2019re okay.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A spokesman for Camp Mystic, the Texas enclave devastated by a July 4 flash flood, is raising concerns about communication failures during the disaster",
      "The leader of Camp Mystic had been tracking the weather before the deadly Texas floods, but it is now unclear whether he saw an urgent warning from the National Weather Service that had triggered an emergency alert to phones in the area, a spokesman for camp\u2019s operators said Wednesday.",
      "Richard \u201cDick\u201d Eastland, the owner of Camp Mystic, began taking action after more than 2 inches of rain had fallen in the area along the Guadalupe River, said Jeff Carr, a spokesman for the family and the camp. He said Eastland had a \u201chome weather station\u201d and was monitoring the rain on July 4.",
      "But after initially portraying to the media this week that Eastland got the weather alerts about a flash flood, Carr told The Associated Press that critical moment in the timeline of the tragedy isn\u2019t as clear as the family and staff first thought. No one in the family or camp staff, Carr said, could now say whether Eastland got the alert at 1:14 a.m.",
      "\u201cIt was assumed that just because he had a cellphone on and shortly after that alert, he was calling his family on the walkie-talkies saying, \u2018Hey, we got two inches in the last hour. We need to get the canoes up. We got things to do,' \u201d Carr said.",
      "The new account by the family comes as Camp Mystic staff has come under scrutiny of their actions, what preventive measures were taken and the camp's emergency plan leading up to a during the catastrophic flood that has killed at least 132 people.",
      "The flash-flood warning that the National Weather Service issued at 1:14 a.m. on July 4 for Kerr County triggered an emergency alerts to broadcast outlets, weather radios and mobile phones. It warned of \u201ca dangerous and life-threatening situation.\u201d The weather service extended the warning at 3:35 a.m. and escalated it to flash-flood emergency at 4:03 a.m.",
      "Eastland died while trying to rescue girls and was found in his Tahoe that was swept away by the floodwaters, Carr said.",
      "Even without a storm, the cellphone coverage at Camp Mystic is spotty at best, so campers and staff turn on their Wi-Fi, Carr said. He called ridiculous criticism that Eastland waited too long before beginning to evacuate the campers, which he said appears to have begun sometime between 2 a.m. and 2:30 a.m.",
      "\u201cCommunication was a huge deficiency,\u201d Carr said. \"This community was hamstrung, nobody could communicate. The first responder, the first rescue personnel that showed up was a game warden.\u201d",
      "According to Carr, Eastland and others started evacuating girls from cabins nearest the overflowing river and moved them to the camp's two-story recreation hall. Of the 10 cabins closest to the river, the recreation hall is the furthest at 865 feet (264 meters) with the closest cabin about 315 feet (96 meters), according to an Associated Press analysis of aerial imagery.",
      "To reach Senior Hill, which was on higher ground , they would have had to cross an overflowing creek, Carr said. At times the young campers were climbing hills in bare feet, he said.",
      "Some of the camp\u2019s buildings \u2014 which flooded \u2014 were in what the Federal Emergency Management Agency considered a 100-year flood plain. But in response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county\u2019s flood map to remove 15 of the camp\u2019s buildings from the hazard area. Carr said there were \u201clegitimate\u201d reasons for filing appeals and suggested that the maps may not always be accurate.",
      "Just before daybreak on the Fourth of July, destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe River, washing away homes and vehicles. Crews in helicopters, boats and drones have been searching for victims.",
      "Officials say 97 people in the Kerrville area may still be missing.",

Comey was fired in 2017, two years before Epstein\u2019s arrest, and has not returned to the government since. Obama was long gone from the White House by the time of Epstein\u2019s death.

In February, the Justice Department released some government documents regarding the case, but there were no new revelations. Then, earlier this month, it acknowledged that a months-long review of additional evidence in the government\u2019s possession had not revealed a list of clients and said no more files related to the case \u2014 other than a video meant to prove that Epstein killed himself \u2014 would be made public. The announcement led to outcry from Trump supporters.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi appeared to intimate in a Fox News interview in February that a client list was \u201csitting on my desk\u201d to be reviewed for release. She said last week that she was referring to the Epstein case file generally, as opposed to an actual client list. Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino then had a contentious conversation at the White House as backlash grew to the Justice Department\u2019s decision to withhold records.",
      "Trump, members of his administration and conservative influencers have spread unsubstantiated claims surrounding Epstein for years. Conspiracy theories about Epstein\u2019s death are a popular trope in right-wing spheres, playing on Trump\u2019s repeated promises to reveal and dismantle the \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2014 a supposed secret network of powerful people manipulating government decisions behind the scenes.",
      "Trump\u2019s rivals have recently taken advantage of right-wing fissures over Epstein. Several Democratic lawmakers are calling for the release of all Epstein files and suggesting Trump could be resisting because he or someone close to him is featured in them. ___",

      "There were 40 aftershocks detected within the first three hours, the center said.",
      "\u201cWe have seen other earthquakes in the area that have not generated significant tsunami waves, but we\u2019re treating it seriously and going through our procedures, making sure communities are notified so they can activate their evacuation procedures,\u201d said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson for Alaska's emergency management division.",
      "The quake was felt as far away as Anchorage, almost 600 miles (966 km) to the northeast.",
      "The National Tsunami Warning Center issued a warning for an area stretching from about 40 miles (64.4 km) southwest of Homer to Unimak Pass, a distance of about 700 miles (1,126 kilometers). Among the larger communities in the area was Kodiak, with a population of about 5,200. The warning was downgraded to an advisory about an hour later, and canceled just before 2:45 p.m.",
      "The highest water level generated by the earthquake in Sand Point was not quite 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) above the tide, the center said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no damage at the airport, doesn\u2019t appear to be any damage at the harbor, no damage to speak of, really,\u201d Sand Point Police Chief Benjamin Allen said.",
      "There was some damage \u2014 in the form of broken bottles \u2014 at the Alaska Commercial general store in town. Manager Vickey McDonald said about half of the store's alcohol aisle had crashed and shattered.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got liquid smoke and barbecue sauce and pickles ... broken on the floor,\u201d McDonald said. \"It smells horrendous in here.\u201d",
      "In Unalaska, a fishing community of about 4,100, officials urged people in possible inundation zones to move at least 50 feet above sea level or 1 mile (1.6 km) inland. In King Cove, which has about 870 residents on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula, officials sent an alert calling on those in the coastal area to move to higher ground.",
      "Tourists Jodie Stevens and her husband, Aaron Park, were looking at the puffins at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward when they heard someone yelling that there had been an earthquake and they needed to evacuate. They walked a few blocks uphill in the rain, with a woman from the center yelling to those they passed to get to higher ground.",
      "They were about halfway to the official high ground spot when they heard a siren signal that all was clear, she said.",
      "The National Weather Service said in posts on social media that there was no tsunami threat for other U.S. and Canadian Pacific coasts in North America, including Washington, Oregon and California.",
      "Alaska's southern coast is earthquake-prone, and Wednesday's was the fifth in roughly the same area since 2020 exceeding magnitude 7, state seismologist Michael West said.",
      "\u201cSomething\u2019s moving in this area,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years.\u201d",
      "That has the attention of seismologists, he said.",
      "\u201cThis area has been and remains capable of larger earthquakes and earthquakes capable of significant tsunami damage,\u201d he said.",

      "A federal appeals court has ruled that Arkansas can enforce its ban on critical race theory in classrooms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A federal appeals court ruled Wednesday that Arkansas can enforce its ban on critical race theory in classrooms, ruling the First Amendment doesn't give students the right to compel the state to offer its instruction in public schools.",
      "A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a preliminary injunction issued against the ban, one of several changes adopted under an education overhaul that Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed in 2023.",
      "The prohibition is being challenged by two teachers and two students at Little Rock Central High School, site of the 1957 desegregation crisis. A federal judge had granted the injunction to the students but not the teachers.",
      "\u201cJust as ordinary citizens cannot require the government to express a certain viewpoint or maintain a prior message, students cannot oblige the government to maintain a particular curriculum or offer certain materials in that curriculum based on the Free Speech Clause,\u201d the judges ruled.",
      "Attorneys for the teachers and students said they were disappointed in the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt gives us pause and concern about a steady erosion of individual rights and protections in this great country,\u201d attorney Mike Laux said in a statement. \"Nonetheless, major aspects of this lawsuit remain viable, and they will proceed in due course.\u201d",
      "Critical race theory is an academic framework dating to the 1970s that centers on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation\u2019s institution. The theory is not a fixture of K-12 education, and Arkansas\u2019 ban does not define what constitutes critical race theory.",
      "Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin praised the court's ruling.",
      "\u201cWith its ruling today, the 8th Circuit continues to ensure that the responsibility of setting curriculum is in the hands of democratically elected officials who, by nature, are responsive to voters,\u201d Griffin said in a statement.",
      "Arkansas is among several Republican-led states that have placed restrictions on how race is taught in the classroom, including prohibitions on critical race theory. President Donald Trump in February ordered federal money for K-12 schools cannot be used on the \u201cindoctrination\u201d of children, including \u201cradical gender ideology and critical race theory.\u201d",
      "\u201cBig win for common sense, education freedom \u2014 and parents who just want our schools to teach kids how to think, not what to think,\u201d Sanders, who served as Trump\u2019s press secretary during his first term, posted on X after Wednesday\u2019s ruling.",
      "The judges said they weren't minimizing the students' concerns \u201cwhether in this case or in the abstract \u2014 about a government that decides to exercise its discretion over the public school curriculum by prioritizing ideological interests over educational ones.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the Constitution does not give courts the power to block government action based on mere policy disagreements,\u201d the court said.",

      "Illinois has one of the nation\u2019s worst problems with child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers",
      "CHICAGO -- Illinois has one of the nation\u2019s worst problems with child sex abuse at juvenile detention centers, attorneys representing more than 900 survivors who have filed lawsuits said Wednesday.",
      "Dozens of complaints, including several filed this week in Chicago, allege decades of systemic abuse of children by the employees of detention facilities. Similar lawsuits have popped up in states including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, but Illinois stands out for the volume of cases that began piling up last year and the lackluster response from state leaders, according to attorneys.",
      "\u201cThe scale and the magnitude and the severity of these cases are some of the worst we\u2019ve seen all over the United States,\u201d Jerome Block, an attorney who has filed lawsuits nationwide, said at a news conference.",
      "The latest Illinois complaints, filed Tuesday, represent 107 people who experienced abuse as children at 10 centers statewide. Some have since closed. The lawsuits allege abuse from the mid-1990s to 2018, including rape, forced masturbation and beatings by chaplains, counselors, officers and kitchen supervisors.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly, as some who have filed lawsuits have done. Most plaintiffs are identified by initials in the lawsuits.",
      "Survivor Kate-Lynn, who appeared at a Chicago news conference, said she only felt comfortable speaking publicly using her first name. The Illinois woman, now 26, said she was held in solitary confinement at a suburban Chicago facility for a year when she was 14. She said she was sexually and physically abused by at least five staff members who came into her cell and stripped her naked.",
      "As she spoke, a fellow survivor who also planned to speak became overcome with emotion and left the room. He didn't return.",
      "Kate-Lynn said she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.",
      "\u201cGoing to public places is very hard for me,\u201d she said, wiping tears at times. \u201cI feel like I 'm going to be attacked when dealing with authority figures.\"",
      "The lawsuits, first filed in May 2024, and they are slowly making their way through the courts.",
      "Two lawsuits against the state \u2014 representing 83 people \u2014 were filed in the Illinois Court of Claims and seek damages of roughly $2 million per plaintiff, the most allowed under law. Separate lawsuits representing 24 people held as children at a Chicago center, were filed in Cook County and seek more than $100,000 per plaintiff.",
      "Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, who represents the state, has tried to dismiss the cases in court.",
      "Raoul, whose office has investigated church sex abuse cases, declined to comment Wednesday as did officials with the Department of Juvenile Justice and Cook County. The lawsuits also name the state of Illinois and the Department of Corrections. Officials for the governor's office and Corrections did not return messages Wednesday.",
      "While the number of lawsuits grows, few cases have gone to trial or resulted in settlements. Arrests are infrequent.",
      "Many alleged offenders are not named in the lawsuits, represented by initials or physical descriptions as the plaintiffs remembered them. There are several alleged repeat offenders, including a corrections officer who currently serves as a small-town Illinois mayor and was accused separately by 15 people. He has denied the allegations.",
      "Attorneys have called for legislative hearings, outside monitors, victim input and criminal charges by local authorities. Block has also harshly criticized Illinois leaders, including Raoul, saying there is a double standard for the abuse victims juvenile detention centers versus church abuse victims.",
      "\u201cWhen it's the state who perpetrated the abuse, when it's state employees who perpetrated the abuse rather than Catholic priests, the attorney general doesn't want to support the survivors,\u201d he said.",
      "Horrific accounts are detailed in the hundreds of pages of complaints. Many plaintiffs said their abusers threatened them with violence, solitary confinement and longer sentences if they reported the abuse. Others were given fast food, candy, cigarettes or the chance to play videos games if they kept quiet.",
      "Another survivor, a 40-year-old Texas man identified in the lawsuit by the initials J.B. 2, said he was abused when he was 14 years old and staying a facility in St. Charles, which is outside Chicago. He issued a statement through attorneys.",
      "\u201cI want to let my fellow survivors know that we are not alone in this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSpeaking your truth, no matter how gruesome it is, it can help to set you free from yourself and all the hurt that's been bottled up.\u201d",

      "Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says Democrats can win back disaffected voters by focusing on their everyday concerns to counter the anticipated fallout from President Donald Trump\u2019s budget-and-policy package",
      "Democrats can win back disaffected voters by addressing their everyday concerns to counter the anticipated fallout from President Donald Trump's budget-and-policy package, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Wednesday as he began a tour of South Carolina.",
      "Offering blunt advice to fellow Democrats in the traditionally early primary state, Beshear said the national party should take its message directly to places where voters shifted to the Republican Party in 2024, when the GOP won the White House and Congress. The potential 2028 presidential candidate said that message should concentrate on core issues such as jobs, health care, education, transportation and public safety, and how Democrats can make Americans' lives better.",
      "Beshear introduced himself to South Carolina voters as someone with an established record of winning in a deeply Republican state. He is the son of a two-term Kentucky governor, and is now in his second and final term after serving as the state attorney general.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s won three straight races in deep-red Kentucky,\u201d Beshear said at an organized labor conference in Greenville. \u201cI\u2019m the guy that\u2019s beaten Mitch McConnell\u2019s handpicked candidates. I\u2019m the guy that\u2019s beaten Donald Trump\u2019s handpicked candidates.\u201d McConnell is a veteran Kentucky lawmaker who was the longtime Republican leader in the Senate.",
      "Beshear said Trump\u2019s tax and spending cut bill, which passed without any Democratic support, was an attack on rural America and on \"Southerners like us,\u201d but also gives his party a political opening heading into election in 2026 and beyond.",
      "\u201cDemocrats can win again by winning back that middle, and it\u2019s there for the taking,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much discourse right now about the messaging and how Democrats get out of the wilderness. We do it by showing up. We do it by getting dirt on our boots. And we do it by governing well.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Beshear stressed his pro-union credentials, his Southern kinship with the audience and how his Christian faith shapes how he governs. He said health care is a basic human right and he played up Kentucky's record pace of job growth and private-sector investment, saying it shows \u201cyou can be pro-jobs, pro-business and pro-worker all at the same time.\u201d",
      "The governor said Americans have experienced \u201cchaos, incompetence and cruelty\" since Trump returned to the White House, and that the new tax and spending cuts will hurt people on Medicaid and receiving food assistance, in particular. The fallout from Medicaid cuts will threaten many rural hospitals that are major employers, he said.",
      "Republicans say they have delivered broad tax cuts, invested heavily in immigration enforcement and put new restraints on social safety net programs. Democrats say it rolls back health insurance access and raises costs for middle-class Americans while cutting taxes mostly for the rich.",
      "For Beshear, going on the offense against Trump is not enough for Democrats. The party needs to communicate better, he said.",
      "\u201cWe put out major policy papers and then talk about the nuance on it,\" he said. \u201cBut when we explain our why, that\u2019s when people see how bought in we are, how much we care and how hard we\u2019ll work.\u201d",
      "Though the first presidential primary votes are more than two years away, several possible contenders have traveled to South Carolina, New Hampshire and Iowa, states that usually have an early and oversize role in the nomination.",
      "Looking to connect with his South Carolina audience, Beshear punctuated his speech by referring to the group as \u201cy'all.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a Southern governor, this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve said \u2018y\u2019all,\u2019\" he said. \"I also know when you say \u2018bless your heart,\u2019 that ain\u2019t good.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Travelers giddy about being able to keep their shoes on while walking through TSA checkpoints at the airport again may have something else to look forward to: changes to how much liquid they can carry.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday during a conference hosted by \u201cThe Hill\u201d that she is questioning \u201ceverything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\u201d",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Under the Transportation and Security Administration's current guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag. Those containers must be placed in a one-quart resealable plastic bag. Bigger containers must go in checked baggage, though there are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "Noem announced on July 8 that travelers were no longer required to take their shoes off while going through screening after a pilot program showed TSA had the equipment needed to keep airports and aircraft safe while allowing people to keep their shoes on.",
      "That policy had been in place since 2006, several years after \u201cshoe bomber\u201d Richard Reid\u2019s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001.",
      "The limits on liquids were triggered by a 2006 incident where authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\u201d Noem said. \u201cIt takes you one minute.\u201d",

      "The petition filed last month by Littrell's company in a Florida Panhandle county touches on a perennial tug-of-war between usually-wealthy oceanfront property owners and beach-loving members of the public, especially in Florida, which has 825 miles of sandy beaches.",
      "Under Florida law, any sand on a beach below the high tide water mark is public. Many homeowners own the sand down to the average high-water line, though some counties over the decades have passed local ordinances that let the public use otherwise private beaches for sunbathing, fishing and walking if people have historically had access for those purposes.",

      "In the petition, Littrell\u2019s company said that chairs, umbrellas and small tables had been put out on the beach, as well as \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, to mark it as private property.

      "Twenty Democratic-led states have filed a lawsuit against the Federal Emergency Management Agency over the cancellation of a disaster mitigation grant program",
      "Twenty Democratic-led states filed suit Wednesday against the Federal Emergency Management Agency, challenging the elimination of a long-running grant program that helps communities guard against damage from natural disasters.",
      "The lawsuit contends President Donald Trump's administration acted illegally when it announced in April that it was ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program. FEMA canceled some projects already in the works and refused to approve new ones despite funding from Congress.",
      "\u201cIn the wake of devastating flooding in Texas and other states, it\u2019s clear just how critical federal resources are in helping states prepare for and respond to natural disasters,\u201d said Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts, where the federal lawsuit was filed. \"By abruptly and unlawfully shutting down the BRIC program, this administration is abandoning states and local communities that rely on federal funding to protect their residents and, in the event of disaster, save lives.\u201d",
      "FEMA did not immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment. It said in April that the program was \u201cwasteful and ineffective\u201d and \u201cmore concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.\u201d",
      "The program, established by a 2000 law, provides grants for a variety of disaster mitigation efforts, including levees to protect against floods, safe rooms to provide shelter from tornadoes, vegetation management to reduce damage from fires and seismic retrofitting to fortify buildings for earthquakes.",
      "During his first term, Trump signed a law shoring up funding for disaster risk reduction efforts. The program then got a $1 billion boost from an infrastructure law signed by former President Joe Biden. That law requires FEMA to make available at least $200 million annually for disaster mitigation grants for the 2022-2026 fiscal years, the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit contends the Trump administration violated the constitutional separation of powers because Congress had not authorized the program\u2019s demise. It also alleges the program's termination was illegal because the decision was made while FEMA was under the leadership of an acting administrator who had not met the requirements to be in charge of the agency.",
      "The lawsuit says communities in every state have benefited from federal disaster mitigation grants, which saved lives and spared homes, businesses, hospitals and schools from costly damage.",
      "Some communities have already been affected by the decision to end the program.",
      "Hillsborough, North Carolina, had been awarded nearly $7 million to relocate a wastewater pumping station out of a flood plain and make other water and sewer system improvements. But that hadn't happened yet when the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal damaged the pumping station and forced it offline last week.",
      "In rural Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, town officials had hoped to use more than $4 million from the BRIC program to improve stormwater drainage and safeguard a vulnerable electric system, thus protecting investments in a historic theater and other businesses. While the community largely supports Trump, assistant town manager Erin Burris said people were blindsided by the lost funding they had spent years pursuing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had downtown property owners saying, \u2018What do we do?\u2019\u201d Burris said. \u201cI\u2019ve got engineering plans ready to go and I don\u2019t have the money to do it.\u201d",

      "Nebraska has filed a lawsuit against Colorado over how much water its neighbor draws from the South Platte River",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska is suing Colorado over the amount of water it draws from the South Platte River, the latest in a long history of water rights disputes between the states that have been left increasingly dry by climate change.",
      "Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and state Attorney General Mike Hilgers held a news conference Wednesday to announce the lawsuit, which was filed with the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear. Colorado has been holding water back from Nebraska for almost 100 years and getting more and more egregious every single day,\u201d Pillen said, pointing to Colorado's rapidly expanding population over the past decade.",
      "\u201cSo today it\u2019s really, really simple: We\u2019re here to put our gloves on,\" Pillen said. \"We\u2019re going to fight like heck. We\u2019re going to get every drop of water.\u201d",
      "Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called the lawsuit \u201cunfortunate\u201d in a written statement and said Nebraska officials failed \u201cto look for reasonable solutions.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit accuses Colorado of depriving Nebraska of as much as 1.3 million acre-feet (about 160,350 hectare-meters) of water from the river over several years that Nebraska is entitled to under a 1923 compact between the states. The suit also accuses Colorado officials of blocking Nebraska's effort to construct a massive canal \u2014 often called the Perkins County Canal \u2014 and reservoir project that would see Nebraska seize land in Colorado to divert water into Nebraska, which is also allowed under the compact.",
      "Nebraska needs the water not only for agriculture production in its southwestern region \u2014 which climate experts predict will grow hotter and drier in the coming decades \u2014 but also to feed water supplies in the eastern part of the state, officials said. Nebraska's capital, Lincoln, is expected to get 12% of its water from the proposed canal, Pillen said.",
      "The compact entitles Nebraska to 120 cubic feet (3.4 cubic meters) per second from the river during the irrigation season between April 1 and Oct. 15 each year, and 500 cubic feet (about 14 cubic meters) per second during the non-irrigation fall and winter months. Hilgers said Colorado has been shortchanging Nebraska during the irrigation season, allowing only about 75 cubic feet (about 2 cubic meters) per second of water daily into Nebraska this summer.",
      "\u201cI think this may be the most consequential lawsuit that this office will be a part of in my generation,\u201d Hilgers said. \u201cIt is almost impossible to overstate the importance of the South Platte River to the future of the state of Nebraska.\u201d",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a statement calling the lawsuit meritless and denied that Colorado had violated the compact.",
      "The South Platte, which flows through northeastern Colorado into southwestern Nebraska, has been at the center of a tempest brewing between the two states going back to 2022, when Nebraska announced it would build the canal.",
      "Since then, officials from the two states have been haggling over how to carry out both the terms of the compact and land acquisition to build the canal.",
      "Hilgers said the two states are at an impasse. Weiser countered that Nebraska officials should have remained at the negotiating table.",
      "\u201cNebraska\u2019s actions will force Colorado water users to build additional new projects to lessen the impact of the proposed Perkins County Canal,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the dust finally settles, likely over a billion dollars will have been spent \u2014 tens of millions of that on litigation alone \u2014 and no one in Nebraska or Colorado will be better off.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed directly with the Supreme Court because it handles disputes between states, Hilgers said. The process \u201cisn't fast,\u201d he warned.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll probably have a special master appointed within the next 12 months, and under normal litigation timelines, that\u2019s maybe 3 to 5 years before we get a result,\u201d he said.",
      "That does not mean work on the canal will stop, he said, as he expects work on permitting and design of the canal to continue.",
      "Nebraska has been at the center of interstate water disputes for decades. In 2002, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas reached a settlement over Republican River water allocation after years of legal wrangling. But disputes continued, and new agreements were reached among the states again in 2014.",
      "Water disputes could become more common as climate change worsens shortages, said Dr. Carly Phillips, a research scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists \u2014 a nonprofit that advocates for climate change solutions.",
      "Warmer temperatures affect multiple parts of the hydrological cycle, Phillips said. It is decreasing the snowpack, which is the main way water is stored in the western U.S. Higher temperatures also mean the snow melts earlier each year, changing the availability of stream flow. And states like Nebraska might see increased irrigation demand when it\u2019s hotter.",
      "\u201cThese patterns are all in the same direction across the board,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe trends are really consistent when it comes to snowpack, stream flow, evaporation and irrigation demand.\u201d",

      "Two Republican lawmakers in California have launched a campaign to require voter ID and proof of citizenship at the polls",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Two California Republican state lawmakers launched a campaign Wednesday to place a measure on the 2026 ballot that would require voter identification and proof of citizenship at the polls.",
      "The proposal would require the state to verify proof of citizenship when a person registers to vote, and voters would have to provide identifications at the polls. Those who vote through mail-in ballots would have to give the last four digits of a government-issued ID such as a Social Security number.",
      "\u201cWe do not want to make it harder to vote. In fact, our initiative makes it easier to vote because it streamlines the process to verify someone\u2019s identity,\u201d Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, who's leading the effort, said at a Wednesday news conference.",
      "The Republican lawmakers said the measure would help restore trust in elections where they said people have complained about outdated voter rolls and an inadequate signature review process, with some also casting doubt on election results. The effort was not new. DeMaio unsuccessfully attempted to place a similar measure requiring voter identification on the ballot the last election.",
      "While voting by noncitizens has occurred, research and reviews of state cases have shown it to be rare and typically a mistake rather than an intentional effort to sway an election. Voter fraud is also rare.",
      "California is among 14 states and the District of Columbia that do not require voters to show some form of identification at the polls or to register to vote.",
      "The California campaign came as congressional Republicans were working to advance their own legislation to overhaul the nation's voting procedures at the urging of President Donald Trump. Across the country, lawmakers in 17 states have introduced legislation this year to require proof of citizenship for voters, according to National Conference of State legislatures.",
      "Opponents argued that such requirements make it more difficult for people to vote, especially the elderly, those with disabilities and those without driver\u2019s licenses. Democrats in the California Legislature, who hold supermajorities in both chambers, in April rejected a bill by DeMaio aiming to enact similar voting rule changes.",
      "The statewide proposal also came as the state continued to challenge a local measure passed by voters in the city of Huntington Beach to require voter identification at the polls. The state last year sued the city over the new rule, and Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law to prohibit local governments in California from establishing and enforcing laws that require residents provide identification to vote in elections.",
      "Sen. Tony Strickland, who helped pass the Huntington Beach measure as a city councilmember last year, said he expects a similar fight from state Democrats over the issue.",
      "\u201cThe courts would be on our side because we carefully drafted this initiative. It's constitutional,\u201d he said.",

      "American companies in China are reporting record-low investment plans and declining confidence in profits this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- American companies in China are reporting record-low new investment plans for this year and declining confidence in their profitability, with uncertainty in U.S.-China relations and President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs their top concerns, according to a survey released Wednesday.",
      "The companies are also challenged by China's slowing economy, where weak domestic demand and overcapacity in local industries are eroding profitability for the Americans.",
      "\u201cBusinesses in China are less profitable now than they were years ago, but risks, including reputational risk, regulatory risk, and political risk, are increasing,\u201d said Sean Stein, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council, a Washington-based group that represents American companies doing business in China, including major multinationals.",
      "The survey, conducted between March and May and drawing from 130 member companies, came as the two countries clash over tariffs and non-tariff measures, including export controls on critical products such as rare-earth magnets and advanced computer chips. Following high-level talks in Geneva and London, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to pull back from sky-high tariffs and restrictions on exports, but uncertainty persists as the two sides are yet to hammer out a more permanent trade deal.",
      "Kyle Sullivan, vice president of business advisory services at the USCBC, said more than half of the companies in the survey indicated they do not have new investment plans in China \u201cat all\u201d this year.",
      "\"That\u2019s a record high,\u201d Sullivan said, noting that it is \u201c\u201da new development that we have not observed in previous surveys.\u201d",
      "Around 40% of companies reported negative effects from U.S. export control measures, with many experiencing lost sales, severed customer relationships, and reputational damage from being unreliable suppliers, according to the survey. Citing national security, the U.S. government has banned exports to China of high-tech products, such as the most advanced chips, which could help boost China's military capabilities.",
      "Stein argued that export controls must be very carefully targeted, because businesses from Europe or Japan, or local businesses in China would immediately fill the void left by American companies.",
      "Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia won approval from the Trump administration to resume sales to China of its advanced H20 chips used to develop artificial intelligence, its CEO Jensen Huang announced on Monday, though the company's most powerful chips remain under U.S. export control rules.",
      "While 82% of U.S. companies reported profits in 2024, fewer than half are optimistic about the future in China, reflecting concerns over tariffs, deflation, and policy uncertainty, according to the survey.",
      "Also, a record high number of American businesses plan to relocate their business operations outside of China, Sullivan said, as 27% of the members indicated so, up from 19% the year before.",
      "In a departure from past surveys, concerns over China's regulatory environment, including risks of intellectual property misuse and lack of market access, didn\u2019t make it to the top five concerns this year. That's likely a first, and not for a good reason, Stein said.",
      "\u201cIt is not because things got dramatically better on the Chinese side, but the new challenges, often coming from the U.S., are now posing as much of a challenge,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Almost all the American companies said they cannot remain globally competitive without their Chinese operations.",
      "A survey from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in May found that European companies were cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices.",

But governments, health experts and people with HIV around the world are alarmed by the effects of other U.S. aid cuts and chaos that are already disrupting the crucial supply of HIV drugs \u2014 which are meant to be taken daily.",
      "Here's a look at PEPFAR and how it affects millions of people globally.",
      "Today, many babies are born infection-free to mothers with HIV \u2014 the U.S. State Department says PEPFAR has been responsible for 5.5 million such births \u2014 and most people around the world no longer see an infection as a death sentence.",
      "Governments in Africa and elsewhere had even begun to worry about complacency as people, especially youths, took the widespread availability of HIV drugs for granted. In another significant step forward, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved for use the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV.",
      "But the abrupt U.S. aid cuts have health officials in developing countries warning of a return to the early days of the AIDS pandemic, when drugs were nonexistent or severely limited and clinics were filled with the dying. PEPFAR was launched in 2004 in response to those grim scenes.",
      "Also known as the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the program has partnered with nonprofit groups to provide HIV medication \u2014 including the preventative PrEP \u2014 to millions around the world. It has strengthened national health care systems, cared for children orphaned by AIDS and provided job training for people at risk. It has played an important role in testing for and tracking HIV infections.",
      "HIV/AIDS has no cure, and it has killed over 40 million people globally over the years. Now the U.N. agency on AIDS is warning that analysis suggests 4 million additional AIDS-related deaths between now and 2029, including 300,000 additional children\u2019s deaths, if programs permanently lose PEPFAR's support.",
      "Since PEPFAR's creation by Congress and Republican President George W. Bush, the program has largely enjoyed support across the political spectrum \u2014 and gratitude from countries whose health systems have been poorly equipped to care for millions with HIV.",
      "But misinformation has crept in. The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative Washington think tank, accused the Biden administration of using PEPFAR \u201cto promote its domestic radical social agenda overseas.\u201d Conservatives claimed there were efforts to integrate abortion with HIV/AIDS prevention, a claim the Biden administration denied. Similar claims linger under the Trump administration.",
      "Trump and his officials also claim widespread waste and fraud as they seek to dismantle U.S. foreign aid. But PEPFAR has been repeatedly scrutinized. Last year, the government said the State Department's Office of Inspector General had conducted 80 audits, inspections, and special reviews that included oversight of PEPFAR programs, \u201cincluding 21 thematic reviews and audits specifically focused on PEPFAR.\u201d",
      "The $400 million proposed cut to PEPFAR still could be restored, in part or in full, as the bill on spending cuts faces a final vote in the Senate, a vote in the House of Representatives and Trump's signature before a Friday deadline.",
      "\u201cWe must stay vigilant,\u201d International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement Wednesday after PEPFAR appeared to be spared.",
      "No matter what, countries and health experts say it will be impossible to fill the funding gap left by the overall U.S. withdrawal of billions of dollars in aid for the global HIV response, including via PEPFAR.",
      "Last month, a UNAIDS report said the abrupt cuts have \u201cdestabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities.\u201d",
      "South Africa, where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world, has said 12 specialized HIV clinics that were funded by the U.S. have had to close down and over 8,000 health workers in its national HIV program are out of work.",
      "Now health workers there and elsewhere are trying to track down an unknown number of people who have lost access to HIV medication. The stakes are deadly. Stopping the drugs allows the virus to start multiplying again. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. The virus could even become drug-resistant.",
      "\u201cIt has really been hectic for us,\u201d said Mbonisiwe Hlongwane, manager of the HIV program at the Bertha Gxowa public hospital in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. And the uncertainty only continues.",

      "Trump made his comment about being \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to dismiss Powell \u2014 \u201dunless he has to leave for fraud\u201d \u2014 during an Oval Office meeting with Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, the crown prince of Bahrain.",
      "In recent days, White House and administration officials have accused Powell of mismanaging a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed, adding to months of efforts by Trump try to rid himself of the politically independent central banker.",
      "U.S. stocks were shaky as Trump spoke about Powell on Wednesday. The S&P 500's modest gain in the morning became a drop of 0.7% after initial reports that the president may fire the Fed chair. Stocks then trimmed their losses after Trump's later comment.",
      "Treasury yields also swiveled in the bond market but remained mostly calm.",
      "Those at the White House meeting were among the more far-right lawmakers, including members of the House Freedom Cause whose views are not always shared by other Republicans. In the Senate, Republicans have taken a more guarded approach. Some have backed Powell\u2019s performance at the Fed as they await an inspector general's review of the construction project.",
      "In a speech Wednesday, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said if Powell is dismissed, \u201cyou are going to see a pretty immediate response\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anybody thinks it would be a good idea for the Fed to become another agency in the government subject to the president, they\u2019re making a huge mistake,\" said Tillis, who has announced that he is not running for reelection.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said this week that Powell \u201chas done a decent job.\u201d",
      "\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s been perfect,\u201d he said, adding that there have been times they disagreed, but \u201cI do believe that the chairman is calling them like he sees them.\u201d",
      "Republicans on the House Financial Services Committee had been scheduled to meet with Powell on Wednesday evening in a gathering set months ago, but it was abruptly canceled due to votes in the House, according to a committee aide granted anonymity to discuss a private meeting.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A Minnesota man plans to plead not guilty to charges he killed the top Democratic leader in the state House and her husband after wounding another lawmaker and his wife, his attorney said.",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is due in federal court for his arraignment on Sept. 12 under an order issued late Tuesday, hours after a grand jury indicted him on six counts of murder, stalking and firearms violations. The murder charges could carry the federal death penalty.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, prosecutors released a rambling handwritten letter they say Boelter wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel in which he confessed to the June 14 shootings of Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark. However, the letter doesn't make clear why he targeted the couples.",
      "Boelter's federal defender, Manny Atwal, said in an email that the weighty charges do not come as a surprise.",
      "\u201cThe indictment starts the process of receiving discovery which will allow me to evaluate the case,\u201d Atwal said Tuesday. She did not immediately comment Wednesday on any possible defense strategies.",
      "At his last court appearance, Boelter said he was \u201clooking forward to the facts about the 14th coming out.\u201d",
      "While the scheduling order set a trial date of Nov. 3, Atwal said it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to happen so soon.",
      "Investigators have already gathered a huge amount of evidence that both sides will need time to evaluate. The scheduling order acknowledges that both sides may find grounds for seeking extensions. And the potential for a death sentence adds yet another level of complexity.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joe Thompson, reiterated Tuesday that they consider the former House speaker's death a \u201cpolitical assassination\u201d and the wounding of Sen. John Hoffman an \u201cattempted assassination.\u201d",
      "But Thompson told reporters a decision on whether to seek the death penalty \u201cwill not come for several months.\u201d He said it will ultimately be up to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, with input from the capital case unit at the Department of Justice, local prosecutors and the victims.",
      "Minnesota abolished its state death penalty in 1911, but the Trump administration says it intends to be aggressive in seeking capital punishment for eligible federal crimes.",
      "Boelter's motivations remain murky. Friends have described him as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views who had been struggling to find work. Boelter allegedly made lists of politicians in Minnesota and other states \u2014 all or mostly Democrats \u2014 and attorneys at national law firms. In an interview published by the New York Post on Saturday, Boelter insisted the shootings had nothing to do with his opposition to abortion or his support for President Donald Trump, but he declined to elaborate on that point.",
      "\u201cThere is little evidence showing why he turned to political violence and extremism,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Prosecutors say Boelter was disguised as a police officer and driving a fake squad car early June 14 when he went to the Hoffmans' home in the Minneapolis suburb of Champlin. He allegedly shot the senator nine times, and his wife, Yvette, eight times, but they survived.",
      "Boelter later allegedly went to the Hortmans\u2019 home in nearby Brooklyn Park and killed both of them. Their dog was so gravely injured that he had to be euthanized.",
      "Investigators found Boelter's letter to the FBI director in the car he abandoned near his rural home in Green Isle, west of Minneapolis. He surrendered the night after the shootings following what authorities have called the largest search for a suspect in Minnesota history.",

      "HOUSTON -- A judge on Wednesday set a new execution date for Robert Roberson, a Texas man who won a last-minute reprieve last year and could become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death for a murder conviction tied to a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "State district Judge Austin Reeve Jackson set an Oct. 16 execution date for Roberson during a court hearing.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office had requested that the execution date be scheduled. Roberson\u2019s lawyers had objected, arguing Roberson still has an appeal pending before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that his legal team says contains \u201cpowerful new evidence of his innocence.\u201d",
      "Roberson received a last-minute stay last October after a flurry of legal challenges that were prompted by an unprecedented maneuver from a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers who say he is innocent and was sent to death row based on flawed science.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of the 2002 killing of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the East Texas city of Palestine. Prosecutors argued he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what\u2019s called shaken baby syndrome. His lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia.",
      "In its latest appeal filed in February, Roberson\u2019s legal team said that based on new evidence \u201cno rational juror would find Roberson guilty of capital murder; and unreliable and outdated scientific and medical evidence was material to his conviction.\u201d The new evidence includes statements from pathologists that state the girl\u2019s death was not a homicide and who question the reliability of conclusions by the medical examiner on the cause of death.",
      "Roberson was in a holding cell on Oct. 17, 2024, a few feet away from America\u2019s busiest death chamber in Huntsville, waiting to receive a lethal injection when he was granted an execution stay after a group of Texas lawmakers issued a subpoena for him to testify before a House committee several days after he was scheduled to die.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it could not be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",
      "Roberson never testified before the House committee as Paxton\u2019s office blocked efforts to have him speak to lawmakers.",
      "Court documents show the Anderson County District Attorney\u2019s Office, which had prosecuted Roberson, has agreed to let Paxton's office take over the case.",

      "\"Then the movie is released and you're like, 'is the public gonna like it? Are the critics gonna like it? And is it gonna make money?' Fortunately with this one, it went well on all three of those,\" Gunn told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The movie depicts Superman, while still powerful, as more human. An initial image shows him bloodied in the snow. Actor David Corenswet plays Superman in the film.",
      "\"As a child, the reason I liked Batman better than Superman was because Superman was just too strong at times,\" Gunn explained. \"I think that this is, we're building a whole universe of characters and I didn't want to have one guy who was so much stronger than anybody else that, you know, a guy with a bow and arrow didn't matter.\"",
      "Gunn also dove into Superman's relationship with Lois Lane, played by Rachel Brosnahan, saying Lane was more cynical and less idealistic than Superman.",
      "\"Lois is a journalist to her core and \u2026 what's her high key value? It's truth. What's Superman's key value? It's life. \u2026 Those are two really important things, but they aren't always, you know, they don't always go together so well,\" he said.",

      "He wrote spy novels, westerns and speculative fiction under a variety of pseudonyms and, at the behest of his agent, added Cruz to his name when his 1977 thriller \"Nightwing\" was published. He became an international name with 1981's \"Gorky Park,\" the story of a triple murder in Moscow, and the Russian detective, Arkady Renko, who risks his life to solve it. Rich in mood and gripping in narrative, the book starred a protagonist who stood at odds with his mother country and the political apparatus consuming it.",

    "story": [
      "A mosaic panel on travertine slabs, depicting an erotic theme from the Roman era, was returned to the archaeological park of Pompeii on Tuesday, after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II.",
      "The mosaic depicts a pair of lovers in a state of undress. A male figure is lounging on a bed or couch, while a female figure is standing, facing away from the viewer.",
      "The artwork was repatriated from Germany through diplomatic channels, arranged by the Italian Consulate in Stuttgart, Germany, after having been returned from the heirs of the last owner, a deceased German citizen.",
      "The owner had received the mosaic as a gift from a Wehrmacht captain, assigned to the military supply chain in Italy during the war.",
      "The mosaic \u2014 dating between mid- to last century B.C. and the first century \u2014 is considered a work of \"extraordinary cultural interest,\" experts said. It may have decorated the floor of a bedroom, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii said in a news release.",
      "\"It is the moment when the theme of domestic love becomes an artistic subject,\" said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii and co-author of an essay dedicated to the returned work. \"While the Hellenistic period, from the fourth to the first century B.C., exulted the passion of mythological and heroic figures, now we see a new theme.\"",
      "The heirs of the mosaic's last owner in Germany contacted the Carabinieri unit in Rome that's dedicated to protecting cultural heritage, which was in charge of the investigation, asking for information on how to return the mosaic to the Italian state. Authorities carried out the necessary checks to establish its authenticity and provenance, and then worked to repatriate the mosaic in September 2023.",
      "The collaboration with the Archaeological Park of Pompeii was also key, as it made it possible to trace it to near the Mount Vesuvius volcano, despite the scarcity of data on the original context of its discovery, the Carabinieri said.",
      "The panel was then assigned to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii where, suitably catalogued, it will be protected and available for educational and research purposes. Photos show the tile on display, behind a glass cover. A small crowd gathered to look at and photograph the piece.",
      "\"Today's return is like healing an open wound,\" Zuchtriegel said, adding that the mosaic allows to reconstruct the story of that period, the first century A.D., before Pompeii was destroyed by the Vesuvius eruption in A.D. 79.",
      "The park's director also highlighted how the return by the heirs of its owner signals an important change in \"mentality,\" as \"the sense of possession (of stolen art) becomes a heavy burden.\"",
      "\"We see that often in the many letters we receive from people who may have stolen just a stone, to bring home a piece of Pompeii,\" Zuchtriegel said.",
      "Photos posted on social media by the Archaeological Park of Pompeii show the mosaic being handed over by police and later being put on display.",
      "Zuchtriegel recalled the so-called \"Pompeii curse,\" which according to a popular superstition hits whoever steals artifacts in Pompeii.",
      "The world-known legend suggests that those who steal finds from the ancient city of Pompeii will experience bad luck or misfortune. That has been fueled over the years by several tourists who return stolen items, claiming they brought them bad luck and caused tragic events.",

      "Actor Nick Offerman brings his signature deadpan delivery to the animated world as Ken, Papa Smurf's brother, in the upcoming \"Smurfs\" movie hitting theaters Friday.",
      "The \"Parks and Recreation\" star said he developed his distinctive comedic timing from an early age.",
      "\"When I was a kid in the Catholic church, they had we do the readings of the gospel,\" Offerman said. \"I learned then that if I gave it some gravitas, the congregation would be moved. But if I turned it up just a little bit, my cousins would laugh ... that was where I discovered deadpan.\"",
      "Offerman recorded his voice work separately from co-star John Goodman, who voices Papa Smurf, due to modern animation practices that became more common after COVID-19.",
      "\"I was shooting a show in Budapest last year, and so I recorded a bunch of my sessions from a studio in Budapest,\" he said. \"John was recording his from London and New Orleans. Eventually, you hear each other when you start to get all the recordings together.\"",
      "The actor found deeper meaning in the film's central message about community and belonging.",
      "\"The thing I love the most about it is no-name smurf is on this quest to find out what his place is, trying to find himself,\" Offerman explained. \"The message is that everybody, you know, that we require diversity to make a strong community or family or village of smurfs.\"",
      "He said that self-discovery comes through connection with others rather than isolation.",
      "\"You don't learn what your special talent is looking at your phone, or looking in the mirror,\" Offerman said. \"You learn from your community. They will tell you what they need from you, and that's how you discover what your power is.\"",
      "\"Smurfs\" is distributed by Paramount Pictures, which is part of CBS' parent company, Paramount Global. \"Smurfs\" hits theaters on July 18.",

    "summary": "President Trump and Rosie O'Donnell have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Mr. Trump's involvement in politics.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he is considering \"taking away\" the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O'Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\"Because of the fact that Rosie O'Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \"if they want her.\"",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Mr. Trump's involvement in politics. In recent days, O'Donnell on social media denounced Mr. Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "Responding to Mr. Trump Saturday, O'Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and to \"add me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\"",
      "O'Donnell wrote that Mr. Trump \"has always hated the fact that i see him for who he is \u2014 a criminal con man sexual abusing liar out to harm our nation to serve himself \u2014 this is why i moved to ireland.\"",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Mr. Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Mr. Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk. But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa.",
      "O'Donnell was born in the U.S. and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. It cannot be revoked by the president. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2014 but only if the act is performed voluntarily and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Since taking office again in January, Mr. Trump has sought to limit paths to citizenship and access to green cards. On Thursday, a federal judge issued a nationwide block against Mr. Trump's executive order\u00a0ending birthright citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\"The president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \"In short, we are a nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\"",

    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",

      "The National Institutes of Health's toxicology program in 2024\u00a0determined\u00a0\"with moderate confidence\" that there is a link between high levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQs in children. That conclusion was based on studies involving fluoride levels of about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",

      "While not a permanent fix, the updated software will \"allow for the detection of a cracked fuel injector and invokes a strategy to disable the high-pressure fuel pump, derate engine power output and reduce temperatures of possible ignition sources in the engine compartment,\" Ford stated in previous recall documents relating to the problem.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",

      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",
      "Retailers focus on sales",
      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",
      "Walmart on Tuesday\u00a0announced\u00a0lower prices on 14 of the most popular back-to-school supplies compared with last year. A survey by the retail giant found that 70% of its customers said they planned to spend more time this year searching for discounts.",
      "\"Regardless of income, families want to ensure their students are set up for success,\" said Phil Rist, executive vice president of strategy at analytics firm Prosper, said in a statement. \"They are cutting back in other areas, using buy now, pay later or buying used or refurbished items to have everything they need for the school year.\"",

      "The Consumer Price Index in June rose 2.7% on an annual basis, a sign inflation around the U.S. is creeping up after declining earlier this year.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was forecast to rise 2.7% last month, higher than last month's rate of 2.4%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. June's reading is the highest since February, when the CPI rose 2.8% on an annual basis.",

      "Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge, said in a report that certain categories exposed to tariffs \u2014 ranging from apparel, home furnishings and appliances to footwear and toys \u2014 saw some upward pricing pressure. But other products vulnerable to higher levies, such as vehicles, remained stable.",
      "EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco estimates that roughly a third of the June rise in the CPI is attributable to higher tariffs.",
      "The muted CPI data from previous months indicates that companies have taken steps to offset the costs of tariffs, largely shielding consumers from price shocks. However, that could change.",
      "\"Strategies used by companies to avoid passing on cost increases to consumers are not eternal,\" Daco noted in a report.",

    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "summary": "The latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development.",
    "story": [
      "Aaron J. Snoswell is a senior research fellow in AI Accountability at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embedded in X (formerly Twitter) and built by Elon Musk's company xAI, is back in the headlines after\u00a0calling itself \"MechaHitler\" and producing pro-Nazi remarks.",
      "The developers have\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the \"inappropriate posts\" and \"taken action to ban hate speech\" from Grok's posts on X. Debates about AI bias have been revived, too.",
      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAIMusk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAI",
      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "More than a dozen countries from Asia to the Middle East and South America are potentially in President Trump's crosshairs if he goes ahead with his threat to impose 100% tariffs on goods exported to the United States over their economic ties with Russia.",
      "\"We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\" Mr. Trump said Monday at the White House, laying out a new ultimatum and deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire to end its war in Ukraine.",
      "The levies, he said, would be applied as \"secondary tariffs\" \u2014 not targeting Russia directly, but designed to increase Moscow's economic pain by pressuring its trade partners to stop buying or selling products in the energy, agriculture and weapons sectors with Russia.",
      "China and India became the world's first and second biggest importers of Russian oil in 2023 after Western sanctions were imposed against Moscow in response to its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The top post had previously been held by the 27-nation European Union.",
      "China and India, Asia's two biggest economies, now collectively import an estimated 85% to 90% of the seaborne crude oil sold by Russia's state-managed energy companies, which make up the bulk of its total exports.",
      "After launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022, the Kremlin renegotiated prices with its trade partners, offering steep discounts on Russian oil compared to U.S. and European crude. NATO member Turkey is another major importer of Russian oil and natural gas.",
      "In the Middle East, the United Arab Emirates \u2014   while not a major energy importer itself \u2014   serves as a financial hub for the international trade in Russian oil. Dubai is also a safe haven for Russian capital and oligarchs.",
      "In South America, agricultural powerhouse Brazil is the biggest purchaser of Russian fertilizer products, crucial to supporting its soybean, sugar and coffee exports.",
      "Vietnam and Thailand, both of which try to maintain diplomatic non-alignment in the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014   leaving them stuck in a delicate balancing act between their Eastern and Western trade partners \u2014  do have oil, natural gas, defense and tourism interests with Russia.",
      "Senior Russian officials were quick to downplay the threat of secondary sanctions against its trading partners, and to reject Mr. Trump's ultimatum as \"unacceptable.\"",
      "The president's remarks didn't cause any immediately apparent unease for Russian investors, either, possibly as Mr. Trump left a window of 50 days for some new agreement to take shape, and as he has a recent history of stepping back from previous tariff threats.",

      "The Trump administration has defended its aggressive use of tariffs as a way to ensure fair trade for U.S. businesses; boost key domestic sectors; generate federal revenue; and advance other policy priorities, such as curbing fentanyl trafficking and authorized immigration from Canada and Mexico.",
      "According to\u00a0Reuters, customs duties in June surpassed $100 billion for the first time in a single fiscal year, a sign the stepped-up tariff regime is contributing more revenue.",
      "\"High uncertainty\"",

    "summary": "Fresh tomatoes from Mexico \u2014 which supplies about 70% of the U.S. tomato market \u2014 will face a 17.09% duty.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is imposing a 17% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes, the federal government said Monday, ending a yearslong agreement with the U.S.' southern neighbor over trade practices.",
      "The move comes amid a separate push by President Trump to increase tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, including Mexico, which was told over the weekend to\u00a0expect 30% tariffs starting in August. Critics argue the president's tariff strategy could push up consumer prices. But Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement Monday that the decision on tomatoes is \"in line with President Trump's trade policies and approach with Mexico.\"",
      "\"Mexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes. That ends today,\" Lutnick said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "The U.S. gets around 70% of its tomatoes from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. Roughly $3 billion worth of tomatoes are exported from Mexico to the U.S. every year, an almost threefold jump over the last 15 years, federal data shows.",
      "Supporters argue the tariffs could give a boost to the domestic tomato industry, which the Florida Tomato Exchange says has been \"decimated by an influx of cheap Mexican tomatoes.\" But others warn the move could lead to higher prices and harm U.S. companies that rely on imported tomatoes.",
      "The tariffs follow a complicated,\u00a0nearly three-decade-long dispute over allegations that Mexican tomato producers were illegally selling tomatoes to the U.S. at unfairly low prices, harming U.S. growers. The federal government\u00a0struck a deal\u00a0in 2019 \u2014 during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 that averted \"anti-dumping\" duties on tomatoes in exchange for Mexican producers agreeing to a minimum sale price.",
      "In April, the Commerce Department announced the U.S. would exit that deal in 90 days, saying it \"has failed to protect U.S. tomato growers from unfairly priced Mexican imports.\" The Commerce Department said it would impose 20.91% tariffs \u2014 slightly higher than the 17.09% levies announced Monday.",
      "The Florida Tomato Exchange praised the move in a statement Monday. The group's executive vice president, Robert Guenther, called it \"an enormous victory for American tomato farmers and American agriculture.\"",
      "A group of lawmakers in Florida \u2014 which is one of the U.S.' largest tomato-producing states \u2014\u00a0praised the planned duties\u00a0in a letter to Lutnick last month. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, called the move \"a major victory for American growers and producers.\"",
      "But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Lutnick not to exit the deal on Friday, arguing the Trump administration should try to cut a new deal with Mexico instead. The group said \"the import and sale of Mexican tomatoes generate an estimated $8.3 billion in economic benefits,\" and warned withdrawing from the deal could trigger retaliation from Mexico.",
      "\"Terminating the Agreement would likely have widespread repercussions on the U.S. economy, affecting agriculture, warehousing, logistics, grocery, and restaurant industries,\" the group said in a letter to Lutnick.",
      "The lead-up to Monday's decision also drew criticism from some Democrats.",
      "\"ARIZONA, BUY YOUR TOMATOES NOW!!\" Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, wrote on X last week. \"Groceries are already too expensive. [Mr. Trump] needs to reverse this decision now.\"",
      "\"Salsa will be pricier, shelves emptier, and groceries more expensive. Tens of thousands of jobs, including 30,000 Texans, will be at risk,\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas Democrat,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Mexico's agriculture and economy ministries criticized the move in a statement Monday, saying it was \"unfair and against the interests not only of Mexican producers but also of the U.S. industry.\" They also said the massive growth in tomato exports to the U.S. \"stems from the quality of the product, not from any unfair practices.\" The Mexican government said it expected to find a solution to the dispute.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent letters to dozens of U.S. trading partners over the last week threatening higher tariffs starting August 1, partially reinstating some of the steep country-by-country levies that were rolled out by the Trump administration in April, but quickly delayed for 90 days. The president argues the tariffs are necessary to protect domestic jobs and correct unfair trade practices, but many economists argue tariffs can lead to sluggish economic growth and higher prices.",
      "Food prices grew 2.9% in the 12-month period ending in May \u2014 higher than the country's overall 2.4% inflation rate, but well below mid-2022, when food prices were growing upwards of 10% year-over-year, according to federal data. The price of tomatoes fell 6.8% from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told lawmakers last month he expects tariffs to have some impact on prices. But he added: \"We really don't know how much of that's going to be passed through the consumer. We have to wait and see.\"",

    "summary": "Tesla faces questions over the alleged involvement of its Autopilot system in a 2019 crash that killed Florida college student Naibel Benavides Leon",
    "story": [
      "Tesla heads to federal court in Miami on Monday to defend its Autopilot system in a wrongful death case involving the death of a 22-year-old college student.",
      "The lawsuit, originally filed in April 23, 2021, in the 11th Judicial Court of Florida in Miami-Dade County, builds on previous cases involving Tesla's Autopilot system. The plaintiffs, Dillon Angulo, and the family of Naibel Benavides Leon, who was killed in the accident, are requesting punitive damages and compensation for medical costs and other expenses.",
      "The fatal crash took place in April 2019 when a Model S Tesla equipped with the Autopilot technology struck a parked vehicle in Key Largo, Florida, killing Leon and gravely injuring Angulo.",
      "The trial will be a major test for the EV maker, which has had to contend with slumping sales and a hit to its stock price after CEO Elon Musk spearheaded the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He. has since stepped back from leading DOGE.",
      "The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the case did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Autopilot's reputation at stake",
      "According to recent court filings connected to the case, Tesla owner George McGee had the Autopilot function of his 2019 Tesla Model S activated as he was driving on a two-lane rural road in Key Largo on April 25, 2019. McGee dropped his phone as he was approaching an intersection, and lost sight of the road as he bent down to pick it up, court documents state.",
      "In that moment, McGee's car allegedly plowed through the T-shaped intersection at over 60 miles per hour, failing to brake before crashing into the side of a Chevrolet Tahoe truck parked on the side of the road. The accident killed Naibel Benavides Leon, 22, and seriously injured her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, who were standing by the truck, which he owned.",
      "At issue is whether the car's Autopilot system was defective and contributed to the death of Benavides. In a court filing, Todd Poses, one of the plaintiff's lawyer, claims that design defects in the car's Autopilot system failed to detect obstacles, such as the Chevy Tahoe, resulting in Benavides' death.",
      "Tesla's argument",
      "In its motion for summary judgment, filed on June 26, Tesla argues that the Autopilot feature \"did not make the car 'self-driving'\" and that McGee was aware \"that it was still [his] responsibility to operate the vehicle safely even with Autopilot activate.\"",
      "Said Tesla in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch:",
      "\"The evidence clearly shows that this crash had nothing to do with Tesla's Autopilot technology. Instead, like so many unfortunate accidents since cell phones were invented, this was caused by a distracted driver. To his credit, he took responsibility for his actions because he was searching for his dropped cell phone while also pressing the accelerator, speeding and overriding the car's system at the time of the crash. In 2019 when this occurred, no crash avoidance technology existed that could have prevented this tragic accident.\"",
      "Mary Cummings, a professor of engineering at George Mason University and an expert on advanced driver-assistance systems, is likely to testify at the trial, documents from the lawsuit's docket indicate. McGee, the driver of the car, is also expected to testify.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/auto-loan-interest-deduction-big-beautiful-bill-how-it-works-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

      "The Pentagon has signed on to use Grok, the AI chatbot built by Elon Musk's company xAI, as part of a new $200 million agreement that opens the door for its deployment across the federal government, the company announced Monday.",
      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",
      "The move aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence across the government. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has championed AI as a pillar of national security and innovation.",
      "Musk himself briefly served in the Trump administration earlier this year, overseeing the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before stepping down in May amid a public break with Mr. Trump over his sweeping tax and spending bill. Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",
      "Despite the rift, xAI has continued to expand its government work. The new offering includes custom national security tools, AI-powered science and health applications, and cleared engineering support for classified environments.",
      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",
      "The posts were later deleted and xAI said it \"quickly\" patched the issue. One day later, xAI launched an upgraded version of Grok it described as a major leap forward. Musk also announced that Grok would be used in Teslas.",
      "But the latest version was not without kinks, too: Grok checked with Musk's views before answering a question, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Grok was introduced in late 2023 as a more unfiltered alternative to other chatbots like ChatGPT, and is already integrated into Musk's social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\"America is the world leader in AI,\" xAI said in Monday's post announcing the Pentagon deal. \"We're excited to contribute back to the country that made xAI uniquely possible here.\"",

    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",

      "Although people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, \"there are early warning signs\" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced\u00a0 workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,\" he said.",
      "As of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time,\u00a0according\u00a0to the New York Federal Reserve.",

      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious.

      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",
      "In June, the White House asked Congress to cancel $9.4 billion in appropriations that had previously been approved. The request, known as the rescissions package, passed in the House in mid-June and would cut roughly $8 billion from international assistance, including organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The Senate added an amendment to exempt $400 million in global health funding for PEPFAR, a program started during the Bush administration to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries.",
      "The revised package passed by a vote of 51-48, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in voting against it.",
      "\"My obligation is to my constituents and to the Constitution,\" Murkowski told reporters after voting against an earlier procedural vote Tuesday.. \"So I look at the Constitution and say that it is \u2026 the legislative branch that has the power of the purse. I take that charge personally, and so I'm going to execute on it.\"",
      "In addition to the foreign assistance cuts, the package includes $1.1 billion in reductions for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "The legislation follows an executive order by President Trump in May directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Board to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, alleging partisan bias.",
      "\"Neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens,\" the order stated.",
      "Maher previously testified before a House subcommittee in March alongside PBS CEO Paula Kerger, where they defended their organizations from the accusations of bias. In her interview this week, Maher reiterated that NPR prioritizes stories that \"directly speak to Americans' political interests and changing beliefs.\"",
      "\"I take all criticism seriously, as I think any news organization should,\" Maher said. \"And if there's a perception that we are not serving the full range of American political life, well we need to, we need to respond to that.\"",
      "Ahead of a Friday deadline, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to support the clawbacks or risk losing his support.",
      "\"It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post this month, using a nickname designed to mock MSNBC. \"Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican senators have voiced concerns about cuts to public broadcasting, especially for those serving rural and Native communities. During Wednesday's vote-a-rama, Sen. Maria Cantwell warned that eliminating funding for CPB could endanger those who rely on radio for emergency information.",
      "\"We're not just putting PBS at risk here, we're putting millions of Americans who depend on local media for life-saving information [at risk],\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in a floor speech. \"And what's in this rescission request is really making sure that public broadcasters don't have that ability, at least in 20 states where they have emergency plans.\"",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a GOP holdout who initially expressed skepticism about the rescissions package, said this week he intends to support it after working with the White House to reallocate unused funding through the Department of the Interior to tribal stations.",
      "\"It will keep them in operation. It will be for one year at a time,\" Rounds said.",
      "The rescissions package comes on the heels of the devastating July 4 floods on Texas' Guadalupe River, which left more than 130 dead and search efforts are still ongoing for more than 100 still unaccounted for.",
      "Since the tragedy, there have been questions about the efficiency of emergency alert systems \u2014 many of which, Maher said, rely on public broadcasting.",
      "Maher said communities in rural areas like that would feel the largest impacts of the funding cuts. She said some NPR stations receive \"more than 50% of their budget\" from federal funds and could face tough decisions, from staffing layoffs to potential station closures.",

    "summary": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday will consider the nomination of Emil Bove, a top Justice Department official, to serve as a federal circuit judge.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday will consider the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer and a top Justice Department official, to serve a lifetime appointment as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.",
      "If Bove clears the GOP-led panel, he will surmount a key hurdle amid staunch opposition from a host of former federal prosecutors and judges, as well as allegations of unethical conduct by a Justice Department whistleblower.",
      "Bove's path to winning approval from the Judiciary Committee became easier earlier this week, when Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters that he was inclined to back his nomination. But it's less clear whether he will be confirmed by the full Senate. Republicans hold 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning the nomination would fail if Bove loses the support of four GOP senators.",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May that he had selected Bove to fill a vacancy on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Bove was part of the legal team that represented the president in his criminal cases, including the New York hush-money trial and the two federal cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "After Mr. Trump won a second term, he selected Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove also worked as the acting deputy attorney general while Todd Blanche, the current deputy, awaited confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Bove has been embroiled in controversy since joining the Justice Department. He was accused of pushing a quid pro quo in which the Justice Department would drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for commitments on immigration. Several prosecutors resigned in the wake of the move regarding Adams' case.",
      "Bove defended the decision to drop the charges against Adams, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that it was \"well within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.\" He also argued that Adams' submissions to the court \"refute false public allegations by third parties regarding some sort of improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a former Justice Department attorney who handled immigration cases filed a whistleblower claim with the Senate that accused Bove of suggesting that the administration ignore court orders. The lawyer, Erez Reuveni, worked for more than a decade at the Justice Department and was most recently the acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation.",
      "He was fired in April after he told a federal judge that the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador had been an administrative error. A top immigration official with the administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Reuveni wrote in his report that during one meeting about Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act, Bove said that the Justice Department would need to consider telling the courts \"f**k you\" if a judicial order blocked removals under the law.",
      "Emails and text messages shared with the Senate by the whistleblower include exchanges between Reuveni and a colleague at the Justice Department in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding court orders.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Bove and sought to paint Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Blanche said the claims about Bove and other top Justice Department officials are \"utterly false.\"",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields has also praised Bove as an \"incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in June, Bove denied Reuveni's allegations that he urged department attorneys to violate a court order.",
      "But Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, said that the text messages, email exchanges and other documents show that the Justice Department misled a federal court and disregarded a court order.",
      "\"Mr. Bove spearheaded this effort, which demanded attorneys violate their ethical duty of candor to the court,\" Durbin said.",

    "story": [
      "The sweeping layoffs that hit the State Department last week have triggered confusion and disruption at the agency, gutting some offices unexpectedly and forcing staff to scramble, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "The significant reductions and wholesale elimination of several key offices have heightened meaningful risks to U.S. national security, current and former officials said.",
      "\"It is frustrating that someone who does not know the worth of what they're breaking, breaks it,\" a U.S. official who was laid off Friday told CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration cut 1,353 domestic State Department staffers on Friday, part of a long-planned effort to reorganize the agency and slash its U.S.-based staff by around 15%. The administration says the layoffs \u2014 along with thousands of voluntary departures \u2014 were necessary to streamline a department it argues had become bloated and bureaucratic.",
      "\"We took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters last week.",
      "Multiple State Department employees who spoke to CBS argued the cuts were arbitrary and poorly executed, and could damage U.S. foreign relations while also weakening the country's diplomatic corps. And sources described last week's layoffs as chaotic, with some of the department's bureaus and offices \u2014 including staffers who work on passport fraud \u2014 facing cuts despite earlier indications to Congress that they would be left alone.",
      "Many foreign service officers have stories of sacrifice that Americans may associate more with the military than with the diplomatic corps. Those include stories of being deployed abroad when their parents died, separation from their families while on long tours to places deemed too dangerous, or uprooting families from schools and homes every few years to work on behalf of the United States.",
      "\"I always felt it was worth it even when it was hard and difficult,\" the official said of the sacrifices made during more than a decade of service as a foreign service officer. \"It is a calling.\"",
      "\"If this were the military, people would be up in arms,\" the official told CBS News. \"I just want people to know that we're also the people who help keep you safe. We get you passports for travel, evacuate you when stuck abroad, and get your family members home when they die abroad.\"",
      "Unexpected layoffs rattle diplomatic ranks",
      "Laid-off staffers received their reduction-in-force (or RIF) notices on Friday, and their emails and badges were deactivated at 5 p.m. But some managers of those departments weren't sent lists telling them who was laid off, leaving bosses to piece together who is and isn't still on their teams, according to two current State Department employees and one U.S. official.",
      "Some employees received their layoff notices and were cut off from their government emails while on official travel, a department employee and a U.S. official said. In some cases, laid-off staffers had to use social media to get in touch with foreign counterparts to cancel meetings, and scrambled to book their own return tickets to the United States.",
      "The entire staff of the Office of Casualty Assistance, which assists the families of State Department employees who die overseas, was fired, said a U.S. official and two department employees. Last week, the U.S. Consulate in Monterrey, Mexico, confirmed an American diplomat had been killed in a car accident. Department staff who were working to repatriate the employee's remains had to stop after being laid off Friday, a State Department employee said.",
      "Asked about the Office of Casualty Assistance by Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Wednesday, the department's top official for management Michael Rigas said he \"was aware that function is being folded into another office.\"",
      "The new head of the Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs was laid off, according to a U.S. official, a congressional aide and a State Department employee. The official had come to the office in June, but because the State Department selected May 29 as the cut-off date for reductions-in-force, they were dismissed based on their previous position. The layoff came on the same day that a Palestinian-American was killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and as the administration presses Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.",
      "At least six analysts from the Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, known as INR, were also laid off, three sources familiar with the matter said. The office, which employs roughly 250 analysts and is part of the broader 18-agency U.S. intelligence community, provides diplomats and policymakers with assessments to guide American foreign policy. Ellen McCarthy, who led INR from 2019 to 2021, said in a post on LinkedIn that the cuts were \"short-sighted.\"",
      "\"This isn't just about jobs, it's about weakening a critical capability at exactly the wrong time,\" she wrote. \"We need strong, steady intelligence to inform foreign policy decisions.\"",
      "Some offices hit by surprise cuts",
      "Some of the layoffs were expected. The Trump administration notified Congress earlier this year of its intent to eliminate or merge hundreds of State Department offices, with those focused on humanitarian issues, migration and foreign aid slated for the deepest cuts. A report to Congress took particular aim at human rights-focused offices, which it said were beset by \"radicalism.\"",
      "But when the layoff notices came out on Friday, they included several surprises and did not fully match the cuts that were listed out in the State Department's notification to Congress, according to four sources, including department staffers and a congressional aide.",
      "Some of the reductions-in-force hit offices that weren't slated to be closed down, and other staffers who expected to get pink slips were spared, sources said.",
      "The administration told Congress the reorganization \"will not impact personnel within Consular Affairs' passport or visa operations.\" But on Friday, the staff who work on passport fraud investigations faced deep cuts, according to a U.S. official, a department employee and a congressional aide. The move came as a surprise because the department's Consular Affairs section is largely funded through passport and visa fees, and isn't reliant on taxpayer money.",
      "Rigas told lawmakers Wednesday that staff who process passports were \"not touched,\" but the State Department did consolidate \"other functions which have sort of a management remit and can be combined into other offices.\"",
      "The cuts hit virtually all civil service officers in the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration's office of admissions, which handles refugee resettlement efforts, CBS News had previously reported. Plans to Congress called for that office to be \"rescoped,\" and Friday's layoffs were a surprise, two State Department employees said.",
      "Meanwhile, foreign service officers in the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration's Europe and Near East office weren't laid off, even though the administration's notice to Congress called for the office's elimination, according to a State Department employee.",
      "Asked at a press briefing whether Rubio planned to address the workforce directly about the cuts, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Wednesday, \"The secretary is \u2026 very vocal and likes people and engages with them as often as he can. He cares very much about this department and to the point where \u2013 look, he undertook something that others had talked about or wished could be done but just didn't.\"",
      "In an internal town hall on Tuesday, a video of which was obtained by CBS News, one State Department staffer asked whether any more RIFs were expected for State's overall workforce, to which Under Secretary for Management Jos\u00e9 Cunningham replied, \"I know of no RIFs that are being planned, for domestically, or overseas\".",
      "In response to another staffer in the town hall who had pointed out that the website careers.state.gov is still encouraging people to apply, the head of the department's Global Talent Management bureau Lew Olowski plugged the department's new branding.",
      "\"I do encourage everybody to visit the recruiting page. It's been intentionally redesigned to focus on one of the new themes of the Secretary's vision for recruiting in the Foreign Service, which is patriotism,\" he said. \"A lot of us know patriotism because that's what motivated us to join the workforce. But you might be surprised to know that that actually was not previously an intentional theme of the Department of State in encouraging patriots to come join us in this mission.\"",
      "TV screens seen at the State Department Wednesday advertised a new \"America First Branding Policy\" with instructions on how to access guidelines on \"visually aligning Department activities with the U.S. flag\" at the website brand.america.gov.",
      "The layoffs are part of a broader gambit by the Trump administration to trim the size of the federal government through a combination of layoffs and voluntary buyouts.",
      "The layoffs have drawn lawsuits. But last week, the Supreme Court let the administration move forward with its reduction-in-force plans while those legal battles play out, allowing the State Department to start laying off domestic staff.",
      "In Wednesday's Senate hearing, Rigas said the Trump administration's goal is to make the department\u00a0 \"better able to advance the core interests of the American people and accountable to the American taxpayers.\"",
      "\"We want to empower our ambassadors and diplomats in the field and our regional bureaus in Washington to push forward the president's America First foreign policy agenda and deliver results for the American people,\" Rigas said.",
      "Margaret Brennan is moderator of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on CBS.

      "President Trump campaigned on a vow to round up the \"worst of the worst\" offenders among the criminals who were living illegally inside the United States. But CBS News has obtained deportation data that indicates the Trump administration's deportation push has ensnared many undocumented immigrants without violent criminal records.",
      "Of the estimated 100,000 people who were deported between January 1 and June 24 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 70,583 were convicted criminals, according to an ICE document obtained by CBS News. However, the data also shows that most of the documented infractions were traffic or immigration offenses.",
      "The ICE document listed out raw data that was broken down by conviction, not by deportee.",
      "Some 2,355 of the convictions had to do with sex offenses, making up 1.8% of the total number of criminals who were deported. Another 1,628, or 1.2%, were for sexual assault. The number of homicide convictions totaled 729, or 0.58% of criminal deportees, and the number of convicted kidnappers was 536, or 0.42%.",
      "About 10,738 convictions were for assault, or 15.2% of criminal deportees, the data showed.",
      "ICE's public messaging about its deportation push has focused on undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records, highlighting deportees who were convicted of murder, sex offenses and other violent crimes.",
      "Another stated goal of the Trump administration was to remove those with ties to criminal organizations. The CBS News-obtained document shows that 3,256 of the more than 100,000 people removed, or 3.26%, were known or suspected gang members or terrorists.",
      "In response to a CBS News inquiry, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said ICE has now deported about 140,000 undocumented immigrants since Mr. Trump took office. She also added that 70% of those arrested by ICE were of \"illegal aliens with criminal convictions or have pending criminal charges.\" McLaughlin declined to detail the nature of the convictions or criminal charges, or offer further specifics.",
      "Back on June 11, six Republican lawmakers who are members of the Congressional Hispanic Conference wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons to urge the Trump administration to prioritize the detention of violent offenders, convicted criminals and national security threats.

      "The Republicans who signed the letter include the conference's chair, Rep. Tony Gonzalez of Texas, along with Reps. Monica De La Cruz of Texas, Nicole Malliotakis of New York, David Valadao of California, Maria Elvira Salazar of Florida and Gabe Evans of Colorado.",
      "ICE arrests have soared since Mr. Trump took office, averaging 1,200 per day in the first three weeks of June, according to internal figures previously reported by CBS News. White House adviser Stephen Miller has pushed the agency to aim for 3,000 arrests per day, a more-than-twofold increase that has led to pressure on ICE leadership.",
      "An increasingly large share of people held in ICE deteintion do not have criminal records, CBS News has previously reported. Around 40% of the agency's detainees since Mr. Trump took office had criminal convictions of some kind with 8% of them convicted of violent crimes.",
      "Mr. Trump and top administration officials have said their focus is on arresting and deporting people with serious criminal records.",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority now,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters last month.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan says the administration's primary focus is on the \"worst\" offenders, but he has long said any undocumented immigrant could be subject to arrest.",
      "\"If you're in the country illegally, you are not off the table,\" Homan said at an event in Texas this week. \"We prioritize the worst, first. That makes sense. But it doesn't mean you prioritize this group and everybody else is good to go.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Internal friction with the Justice Department team that fights monopolies has led to private conversations in the Trump administration about whether to push out some staff in the antitrust division or to work to smooth out the issues, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.",
      "Gail Slater, who in March took charge of lawsuits against Capital One, Apple, Google and other major companies as head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, still has support from some top officials in the administration, but she and some on her team have been a target of criticism from colleagues and business leaders, sources inside and outside the administration told CBS News.",
      "Slater was asked to come to a meeting at the White House on Thursday with other high-level administration officials, two of the sources said. The gathering, expected to focus on mergers policy, will include the Office of Budget and Management, the National Economic Council and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "There has been friction over the handling of investigations into T-Mobile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others, sources said. The antitrust division is one of two agencies that protects competition in markets by enforcing the antitrust laws that regulate mergers and business practices that harm consumers.",
      "Slater, who entered her role in high regard in both MAGA circles and among left-leaning watchdogs, hasn't adopted a block-every-merger approach. But some Trump officials have vented that it has taken a substantial amount of internal push-and-pull to land on decisions to reach deals that resolve merger issues, three of the sources said.",
      "Questions have risen inside the NEC, FTC, Federal Communications Commission and in other corners of the administration about whether President Trump's policies are Slater's priority, or whether she's forging her own policy agenda, the sources said.",
      "Slater has also told companies not to try to engage with the administration via Trump-aligned lobbyists and consultants, several sources said. Frustration with that tack led business leaders to reach out to White House officials wondering why they were being told who they can hire, two sources said.",
      "Sources said in one meeting between antitrust officials, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a software company it was seeking to acquire, Juniper Networks, Slater told the business parties they should only work directly with Justice Department officials, not through outside consultants. HPE's consultants included Trump allies Mike Davis and Arthur Schwartz, who weren't in the room.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and her deputies are aware of some administration officials' tension with the antitrust division, sources said.",
      "The Justice Department sued to stop Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying Juniper in January, and the two sides settled the lawsuit in June, paving the way for the acquisition to close.",
      "But multiple sources said Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, had to overrule Slater to accept a Hewlett Packard/Juniper offer, which DOJ officials were confident was a better deal than what the government could've gotten at trial.",
      "Some administration officials defended Slater as deeply principled and laudably untrusting of well-connected Trump allies who want to influence the outcome of confidential legal matters.",
      "One source said Slater has repeatedly noted that she was confirmed by the Senate with 78 votes, more than almost any other Trump official other than Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u2014 a validation that she's well qualified for the role.",
      "\"Gail is a long-time friend and fellow seasoned antitrust lawyer,\" FTC Commissioner Mark Meador told CBS News in a statement. \"She's been a fantastic partner as FTC and DOJ work together to fulfill our shared mission.\"",
      "Some of Slater's supporters noted that unlike the Biden administration, which used as much time as it could statutorily to conduct investigations, Slater and her team have voluntarily closed investigations in a shorter window dozens of times.",
      "And she has diverged from the Biden antitrust team's approach in other ways, another source said. The Biden team, for example, was going to recommend blocking a merger of Capital One and Discover, and Slater allowed it to go through.",

      "There are over 100 partnerships with about 115 countries around the world, according to the National Guard, and the one with the Czech Republic was one of the first after the initiative began in 1991.",
      "The Czechs providing support in the wake of floods in Texas follows assistance the Texas National Guard gave last year when the Czech Republic experienced severe flooding.",
      "When a flood hit Ostrava in the Czech Republic in September 2024, a Texas Air National Guard unit training in Europe diverted an MQ-9 Reaper drone to Ostrava to provide aerial assessments for recovery efforts.",
      "In Texas, about 230 members of the Texas National Guard are currently supporting response efforts. According to the Texas National Guard, members of the guard rescued over 500 people in the initial 24 hours after the flooding began. About 360 of those were evacuated using UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.",
      "During a Black Hawk flight over the Guadalupe River Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pointed out to Nordhaus flood-impacted areas, explaining where the water rose at a terrifying speed \u2014 prompting urgent evacuations \u2014 and emphasizing how intensive the search will remain for the roughly 100 people still unaccounted for.",
      "After the flight, both Abbott and Nordhaus spoke to members of the Guard who have assisted in rescue and recovery efforts since the floods began on July 4.",
      "One of the air rescues came on July 4 when two Guard helicopters evacuated 130 children from Camp Mystic, a summer camp severely impacted by floods that led to the deaths of at least 27 campers and counselors.",
      "The 130 rescued the day of the flood by the guard were evacuated from Camp Mystic and taken to higher ground, according to Captain Connor Garrison, who led one of the aircraft and recounted the mission to Nordhaus and Abbott.",
      "\"I appreciate you, I couldn't be prouder,\" Abbott told Garrison and other members of the Guard.",
      "The Texas National Guard is receiving support from other states like Arkansas, Arizona and North Dakota, which are providing additional personnel or equipment. For instance, North Dakota has sent down one of its own MQ-9 Reaper drones to help survey debris scattered along the still swollen Guadalupe River.",

      "Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an \"ostentatious\" yearslong office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\"",
      "Sources inside the administration told CBS News the president has been socializing the possibility of a for-cause firing in public and private remarks, but the White House has not yet formally built a legal predicate.",
      "The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters \u2014 an allegation Powell has pushed back on.",

      "In a post on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, the president compared the uproar over the Justice Department's handling of the so-called Epstein files to past controversies, like the investigation into his 2016 campaign's possible ties to Russia and Hunter Biden's laptop.",
      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue.

Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "In a meeting at the White House later in the morning, the president reiterated his statement, telling reporters \"they're wasting their time with a guy who obviously had some very serious problems, who died three, four years ago.\"",
      "\"I'd rather talk about the success we have with the economy, the best we've ever had, and all of the things we've done, including the Middle East. I mean, you see it. Instead, they want to talk about the Epstein hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And the sad part is it's people that are really doing the Democrats' work. They're stupid people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's statements highlighted the deep divisions in his party over the handling of the Epstein case, including among some of his strongest supporters.",
      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",
      "Other Republicans have called on Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on charges related to sex trafficking, to testify before Congress. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said that senators \"ought to call her in the Judiciary Committee, put it under oath and have her testify.\"",
      "The president has tried to tamp down the controversy within his party since last week, saying on Tuesday that the Epstein case is \"pretty boring stuff.\"",
      "\"I don't understand it, why they would be so interested. He's [been] dead for a long time, he was never a big factor in terms of life. I don't understand what the interest or what the fascination is,\" he told reporters. \"I really don't, and the credible information has been given.\"",

    "story": [
      "A group of 20 states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday seeking to block what they say was an illegal termination of a program that provided federal funding for natural disaster mitigation projects.",
      "\"By unilaterally shutting down FEMA's flagship pre-disaster mitigation program, Defendants have acted unlawfully and violated core separation of power principles,\" the lawsuit alleges, arguing that the executive branch doesn't have the authority to shut down the program funded by Congress.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, targets Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator David Richardson for their role in shutting down FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, also known as BRIC, program earlier this year. The lawsuit argues the power to make such a decision falls to Congress.",
      "Before it was halted in April, the BRIC program helped fund local infrastructure projects like stormwater control systems and relocating or elevating buildings in flood-prone areas.",
      "\"Projects that have been in development for years, and in which communities have invested millions of dollars for planning, permitting, and environmental review are now threatened,\" the lawsuit states. \"And in the meantime, Americans across the country face a higher risk of harm from natural disasters.\"",
      "A CBS News investigation last month revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election. Two-thirds of the counties losing funding voted for Mr. Trump. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast, the CBS News data analysis found.",
      "The lawsuit calls the impact of the BRIC program's shutdown \"devastating\" and says it will force communities across the country to delay, scale back or cancel hundreds of mitigation projects because of their inability to access their already-approved federal dollars.",
      "Alongside the lawsuit, the states also filed a request for a preliminary injunction asking the court to temporarily block the federal government from reallocating FEMA funds designated for disaster preparedness, arguing states will suffer irreversible damage if the funds are spent before the court rules.",
      "In an April press release announcing the cuts, which has since been removed from the FEMA website, the disaster response agency said the BRIC program was \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\"",
      "The multibillion-dollar BRIC program was established in 2018 under the first Trump administration.",
      "FEMA and DHS did not immediately return a request for comment about the lawsuit.",
      "The states suing are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Most have Democratic state leadership and have filed other lawsuits challenging Trump administration actions. North Carolina was ravaged by mudslides and flash flooding last fall after Hurricane Helene made landfall in late September.",
      "The lawsuit comes as FEMA in recent weeks has faced scrutiny about its response to floods in Texas that killed more than 130 people, including at least 37 children.

    "summary": "President Trump has decried what he calls the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax\" and has blamed Democrats and \"some stupid Republicans\" for doing their work.",
    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday called on the Trump administration to release all records related to Jeffrey Epstein's prosecution and alleged co-conspirators, saying \"the time has come\" for transparency while emphasizing that the names of victims should be protected.",
      "\"I think the time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein's investigation and prosecution,\" Pence said in an interview with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. \"It's important that we protect the names of the victims. They should be excluded from any disclosure.\"",
      "His remarks come as President Trump has taken a sharply different tone. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump dismissed the scrutiny surrounding Epstein's associates as politically motivated. \"It's a big hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's started by Democrats. It's been run by the Democrats for four years.\" He claimed the matter was being pushed by \"some stupid Republicans\" doing Democrats' work.",
      "In a Truth Social post earlier in the day, Mr. Trump wrote that the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax\" is being used by \"past supporters\" who had been \"conned by the Lunatic Left\" and declared, \"I don't want their support anymore.\"",
      "Pence pushed back on the claim that the matter is politically driven. \"Jeffrey Epstein's prosecution began during the Bush administration, continued through the Obama years,\" he said. \"I know of no reason why this administration, once the victims' names are protected, should not release all the files on Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "The Justice Department last week said its review of the Epstein case identified more than 1,000 victims. The review also concluded that Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility in August 2019. Investigators found no evidence of a so-called \"client list\" or that Epstein had blackmailed prominent individuals.",
      "\"I just think we ought to get the facts to the American people, and I've always believed in transparency,\" Pence said.",
      "Pence was also asked about Mr. Trump's signals that he may seek to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \"Well, I've been a critic of the Fed over the years,\" Pence said. \"I have real concerns about what's called the dual mandate where the Federal Reserve is supposed to worry about protecting the dollar, as well as full employment.\"",
      "Pence, however, noted that economic challenges \"don't flow as much to the Fed as they do to the policies of the administration,\" and drew a contrast with how tariffs were handled during the first Trump term. \"We used tariffs and the threat of tariffs to bring down trade barriers and to open up markets,\" he said.",
      "CBS News reported that Mr. Trump on Tuesday night asked GOP lawmakers in a private Oval Office meeting whether he should fire Powell before the end of his term. \"Almost every one of them said I should, but I'm more conservative than they are,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday regarding the night prior's meeting.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-presidential-library-fundraising/",
    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:26:49 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News analysis finds that up to $63 million has been raised for Mr. Trump's future presidential library so far from legal settlements alone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's efforts to direct millions of dollars to his future presidential library has drawn fresh attention to a lack of visibility into the identities or potential interests of the donors who are funding it, a longstanding Washington concern facing past presidents from both parties.",
      "Two prominent Senate Democrats say they are preparing to introduce a bill Wednesday that would regulate fundraising for presidential libraries, according to documents shared with CBS News.",
      "\"Donald Trump is using his presidential library as a tool for bribery while he is still in office,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who is introducing the legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut.",
      "\"Many of the donations to Trump's future library are coming straight from companies and special interests that need a favor from Trump,\" Warren said. \"Right now there are no rules.\"",
      "The effort was spurred by a series of announcements about gifts to the Trump library, including an opulently appointed Boeing 747\u00a0given to the U.S. Air Force by the\u00a0Qatari royal family for the president's use, after which it would be donated to the library for Mr. Trump's post-presidency.",
      "The proceeds of four large legal settlements with the president are also reportedly bound for his library fund. The multimillion-dollar settlements stem from Mr. Trump's lawsuits against Meta, ABC News, X (formerly Twitter) and Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The funds from the four settlements alone could total up to $63 million, according to a CBS News review of news reports and court documents.",
      "Sens. Warren and Blumenthal, along with three House members, Reps. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), are proposing several measures to restrict fundraising for presidential libraries. Among them is a contribution cap of $10,000 per person while the president is still serving in office.",
      "The legislation also proposes quarterly disclosures for all donations of $200 or more, and imposes a two-year \"cooling off\" period after the end of their term during which a president cannot accept donations from foreign nationals, federal government contractors or individuals seeking presidential pardons. Finally, the bill also explicitly bars the use of library donations for personal expenses.",
      "\"Right now, there are basically no rules,\" said Warren. \"The settlements show everyone who has business pending in front of the federal government, that if they've got enough money and can funnel it to Donald Trump through his future presidential library, they might receive better treatment from the US government.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Funding is largely opaque and unregulated",
      "The total amount raised for the Trump library to date is likely far greater than the amounts visible through the president's publicly announced legal settlements. For instance, funds leftover from the $239 million raised by the Trump-Vance inaugural committee \u2014 including millions from tech companies and CEOs such as Amazon, OpenAI, Apple and Uber \u2014 were expected to be redirected to the library, according to multiple news reports. It's unclear how much of those funds have already been transferred. Donations to inaugural funds are required to be reported publicly, whereas presidential libraries are under no such obligation.",
      "The $400 million jet the Trump administration accepted from Qatar in May is also slated to be transferred to the Trump library shortly before he leaves office.",
      "Other than those instances, the funding for the private foundations that support presidential libraries is largely opaque and unregulated, experts said.",
      "\"No one outside the organization knows who contributes to presidential library funds,\" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer who advises tax exempt organizations. \"That information is provided to the IRS, but is not made public.\"",
      "While campaign funds have historically been tightly regulated under a series of laws passed after the Watergate scandal, there are no restrictions on donations to presidential libraries, Kappel said. While in office, presidents can solicit unlimited library donations from anyone \u2014 including foreign nationals, individuals seeking presidential pardons and corporations with federal contracts.",
      "\"The lack of transparency could raise the appearance of impropriety,\" said Kappel. \"No one will know who is making donations to the presidential library while the president is still in office and making government policy.\"",
      "Trustees of the two Trump library organizations and the Trump Organization did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Obama Presidential Foundation, which oversees the development of former President Barack Obama's library\u00a0in Chicago, was founded\u00a0in January 2014, a year after Obama's second term began. The foundation said it would disclose all donors and donations over $200 on a quarterly basis on their website in an effort to increase transparency. It was estimated in June 2021 that the center will cost roughly $700 million to construct.",
      "President George W. Bush's library foundation began fundraising efforts in the spring of 2009, after he left office. The foundation did not publicly disclose its donors. The cost of that effort clocked in at $250 million. The George W. Bush Presidential Center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, opened in 2013.",
      "The first presidential library was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938. Since then, presidential libraries are built and maintained with a mix of private and federal funds. Typically the library itself is constructed with private donations, and occasionally with support from local government or university partners. The library is then transferred to the federal government and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, which oversees the preservation of presidential documents and has a congressionally appropriated budget for maintaining the library structures.",
      "Two nonprofits behind the Trump library",
      "In the last year, the Trump family and associates have established two funds for presidential library donations, according to incorporation records reviewed by CBS News. Both are incorporated as nonprofits in Florida.",
      "The first, the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc., was created in December 2024, before President Trump was sworn in, and shortly after ABC announced it would donate $15 million to the future Trump library to settle a defamation claim the president brought against the network. According to incorporation documents, the fund was established by Jacob Roth, a Florida-based attorney who also filed the paperwork for both the Trump Vance Inauguration Committee Inc. and the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee Inc. in November. According to incorporation documents for the organization, the purpose of the fund is to \"to preserve and steward the legacy of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency.\"",
      "A few months later, in May, a second nonprofit was incorporated under the name Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. There are three listed trustees: Eric Trump; Tiffany Trump's husband, Michael Boulos; and James Kiley, a New York attorney who represented Mr. Trump between 2020 and 2022 during one of his legal battles against his niece, Mary Trump.",
      "This foundation was created to \"steward, preserve, and celebrate the legacy and historical record of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency,\" according to filings.",
      "There may not be rules for what money can go into a presidential library fund, but there are strict rules for how nonprofit funds can be spent.",
      "As nonprofit 501(c)(3)s, tax laws prohibit the use of funds from a presidential library for personal benefit. The IRS is in charge of enforcing all conflict-of-interest laws for nonprofits, although experts are skeptical about the agency's political will to enforce those provisions.",
      "\"501(c)(3)s are supposed to be used for charitable purposes. To the extent funds are being used beyond that, and outside the scope of a presidential library, that's something the IRS would have to look into,\" said Viriginia Canter, who served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "There is no indication that Mr. Trump or his family are using funds for the libraries for personal expenses.",
      "Past library controversies",
      "The Trump family is not the first to face criticism over donations to a library fund while in office. President Bill Clinton faced significant pushback after he pardoned billionaire businessman Marc Rich, who'd fled to Switzerland after he was indicted in 1983 on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with Iran during an embargo and evading more than $48 million in U.S. income taxes.",
      "Clinton's pardon \u2014 which was issued just hours before he left office in January 2001 \u2014 faced scrutiny even from some of his closest allies, who said Rich's pardon appeared to have been bought. They pointed to the $450,000 donation Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, bestowed to the Clinton library foundation and the additional $100,000 she donated to Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign.",
      "And in 2008, a GOP lobbyist with ties to the Bush administration was caught on video allegedly soliciting a donation for his presidential library in exchange for setting up a meeting with top White House officials. (It was a sting operation set up by a newspaper; no money changed hands.)",
      "Congress has tried, and largely failed for almost two decades, to pass legislation that would require organizations raising funds for presidential libraries to disclose donations. Since 2007, the House has passed five bills regarding presidential library funding transparency \u2014 the most recent being in 2019 \u2014 but they have all been stalled in the Senate.",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 16:38:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",
      "\"After a short discussion, they have all agreed to vote tomorrow morning in favor of the Rule,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson telephoned into the meeting and \"looks forward to taking the Vote as early as possible.\"",

    "summary": "As it seeks to ramp up deportations, the Trump administration has sent some migrants to far-flung places that aren't their home countries.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Tuesday said it deported a group of men convicted of violent crimes to the small African country of Eswatini, in its latest expansion of deportations to far-flung places that are not deportees' home countries.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the deportees hailed from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen, and had been convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. The men's criminal records included convictions for murder, homicide and child rape, McLaughlin added.",
      "The deported men, McLaughlin said, are \"so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back.\"",
      "In a statement, the government of Eswatini said the five deportees were transferred to correctional facilities, alongside \"similar offenders.\" The government said it would work to facilitate the men's return to their countries of origin.",
      "Eswatini is a landlocked country in southern Africa that was formerly known as Swaziland. The tiny nation is slightly bigger in size than Connecticut, has around 1.2 million residents and is ruled by a king.",
      "CBS News reported in early May that the U.S. had asked Eswatini, alongside other countries in Africa, Asia and Europe, to receive deportees who are not their own citizens. The talks are part of a larger, aggressive effort by the Trump administration to persuade as many countries as possible \u2014 regardless of their human rights record \u2014 to accept citizens of other nations, including criminals.",
      "President Trump's administration has already used agreements to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador; migrants from Africa and Asia to Costa Rica and Panama; and eight convicted criminals from Asian and Latin American countries to conflict-ridden South Sudan.",
      "Trump administration officials have persuaded other nations, like Honduras and Kosovo, to accept deportees from other countries, though those agreements have not been fully implemented yet. U.S. officials have approached other nations \u2014 including Moldova, Libya and Rwanda \u2014 to strike similar deals.",
      "Historically, the U.S. has sought to deport unauthorized immigrants to third countries if they hail from nations where it's difficult or impossible to deport them, such as those that limit or entirely reject U.S. deportations.",
      "The practice is controversial. Critics say some of the third countries that the Trump administration has turned to \u2014 like South Sudan \u2014 are unsafe, and the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador has sparked legal and humanitarian concerns since the deportees have been held incommunicado at a notorious mega-prison, despite many of them lacking any apparent criminal record.",
      "The administration's campaign to increase deportations to third-party countries gained a major legal victory last month, when the Supreme Court suspended a ruling by a federal judge in Boston that had required the U.S. to give detainees a certain degree of notice and due process before any deportation to a place that was not their country of origin.",
      "That now-suspended lower court order had required officials to give detainees and their lawyers notice of the third country the government wanted to remove them to, as well as a chance to contest their deportation, including by raising fears of being harmed or tortured in that nation.",
      "Soon after the Supreme Court's orders, the administration issued guidance aimed at expediting deportations to third countries by making it harder for would-be deportees to contest their deportation from the U.S.",
      "The directive, authored by acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, said detainees with final orders of deportation can be deported to third-party countries, without any notice or further proceedings, if those nations make \"credible\" assurances to the U.S. that they will not persecute or torture the deportees.",
      "If those assurances are not received or are not deemed credible, Lyons' memo instructs ICE officials to give detainees 24-hour notice of the agency's intention to deport them to a third country. But the guidance says ICE officials can give just 6 hours of notice in \"exigent circumstances,\" so long as the detainees are given \"reasonable means and opportunity\" to talk to an attorney.",
      "During those notice periods, detainees will have the burden of expressing fear of being harmed in a third country to try to contest their deportation. ICE officials will not affirmatively ask detainees about any potential fears, the Lyons memo says.",

      "President Trump and many leaders of the country's largest   technology and energy companies announced more than $90 billion in new investments\u00a0from private companies for Pennsylvania on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 30 minutes during a roundtable discussion at the\u00a0Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit\u00a0at\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, said 20 \"leading technology and energy companies\" will invest in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy, capitalizing on Pennsylvania's technology and energy assets.",
      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Our vision for this event came from the realization about the crucial link between artificial intelligence and energy, but never before have the leaders of all those companies, as well as major investors, come together,\" McCormick said on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted Westinghouse, saying the Pennsylvania-based company is set to build 10 nuclear reactors across the country. He also touted his involvement in consummating a\u00a0$14 billion partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which he said will revitalize the Mon Valley.",
      "Mr. Trump said the investments announced on Tuesday will spawn the development of AI in the region.",

I'm honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I'm honored to be in Pittsburgh, and you're going to see some real action here.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump intends to sign an executive order in the coming days establishing national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image and Likeness program, which has reaped millions of dollars in revenue for top college athletes, according to multiple people familiar with his plans.",
      "College athletes can now make millions before ever going pro thanks to a set of NCAA rules enacted in 2021 that relaxed previous restrictions on being compensated for playing or accepting endorsement deals. Student athletes can now profit from merely showing up to play, or from jersey sales, autographs or serving as spokespeople for companies ranging from global brands to car dealerships near campus.",
      "Mr. Trump is engaging on an issue that has quickly reshaped and, in many ways, roiled college athletics after a House subcommittee on Tuesday advanced a bill along party lines that would establish national standards for sponsorships. The legislation, called the \"SCORE Act,\" would supersede a patchwork of state laws regulating Name, Image and Likeness, or NIL.",
      "While the bill has bipartisan support, there is also bipartisan concern it would give too much power to the NCAA and do little to protect the interests of college athletes.",
      "The NCAA's decision in 2021 to let athletes earn money from NIL deals followed years of political and legal pressure on the collegiate sports giant. For decades, the NCAA imposed steep limits on compensation for student athletes, which it argued were necessary to insulate college athletics from commercial pressures. But opponents \u2014 including many college athletes \u2014 had long argued the rules unfairly cut them out of the millions in revenue that sports like football and basketball can bring in for universities.",
      "Last month, in a massive shakeup, a federal judge signed off on a legal settlement in which the NCAA agreed to let schools pay student athletes directly.",
      "Trump has regularly engaged with professional and college sports of all sorts since and even before retaking office. Whether attending the storied Army-Navy football game last December or stealing the spotlight at last Sunday's Club World Cup championship, the future of sports is a frequent presidential concern.",

    "summary": "Some senators have concerns as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act on the rescissions request.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate narrowly advanced a request from the White House to claw back billions in funds for international aid and public broadcasting, as Congress faces a Friday deadline to act.",
      "The request, known as a rescissions package, cleared its first procedural hurdles late Tuesday, with the help of Vice President JD Vance. The vice president cast two tie-breaking votes after three Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing it.",
      "In June, the White House requested that Congress cancel $9.4 billion in funding that had previously been approved for spending, starting the clock on a process that gives lawmakers 45 days to act. If both chambers don't approve an identical package before the deadline, the funding will be spent as planned.",
      "The legislation seeks to make permanent some of the Department of Government Efficiency's spending cuts, with the primary focus being slashing foreign aid. But it would also effectively cut off federal funding for NPR and PBS.",
      "Earlier Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, appeared uncertain if he had the votes to advance it, but moved ahead with a pair of procedural votes later in the day.",
      "Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against moving forward.",
      "Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought met with Senate Republicans as some members remained resistant to pulling back all of the funding. Vought left the luncheon saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate the cuts to a global AIDS prevention program called PEPFAR.",
      "\"There is a substitute amendment that does not include the PEPFAR rescission and we're fine with that,\" Vought told reporters, referring to the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.",
      "Vought said the package would total $9 billion with the change and is \"substantially the same package.\"",
      "\"We hope that if we can get this across the finish line in the Senate, that the House would accept that one small modification,\" Thune said.",
      "Last month, the House approved the White House's original request, overcoming opposition from all Democrats and four Republicans.",
      "But the change wasn't enough for the holdouts, who said they hadn't been provided specifics about how certain programs will be affected.",
      "\"We've got big, broad categories, but I haven't been given the comfort, if you will, that we're not impacting maternal and child health, that we're not impacting HIV/AIDS, that we're not impacting nutrition programs and programs related to tuberculosis, malaria, polio, neglected tropical disease, pandemic prevention, family planning,\" Murkowski said, adding that she also a strong supporter of public broadcasting.",
      "\"But more important than all of that, more important is our role here. I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told this is the priority we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round. I don't accept that.\"",
      "The rescissions package",
      "The rescissions request would cut $8.3 billion for the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, along with other international assistance programs \u2014 from peacekeeping efforts to refugee assistance and climate projects. Also included in the package is a proposed $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "But some Senate Republicans have opposed components of the package, like cuts to a program aimed at combating HIV and AIDS globally.",
      "Started by former President George W. Bush, PEPFAR has been credited for saving millions of lives around the world. Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters last week that she wants to strike the PEPFAR rescissions, saying, \"I can't imagine why we would want to terminate that program.\"",
      "Collins, the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, pushed back when Vought testified to the panel in June that \"no lifesaving treatment will be impacted by this rescissions package\" and that \"anyone currently receiving lifesaving treatment will continue to receive that treatment.\"",
      "\"When you look at PEPFAR, you are eliminating a lot of the prevention programs,\" Collins said, also questioning whether the package would harm efforts to prevent the spread of tuberculosis, polio and malaria and what effects it would have on maternal and child health programs that help feed malnourished children. \"Those are all programs that have been proven effective.\"",
      "\"These are not only the right thing to do for humanitarian reasons, but they're incredible instruments of soft power,\" Collins said.",
      "Collins on Tuesday said the PEPFAR changes announced by Vought were \"progress,\" but called for more specifics on other cuts.",
      "Others have raised concerns about cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they take on added significance as a means of communicating emergency messages.",
      "One of the Republican members who had concerns, Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said Tuesday he would back the bill after working with the Trump administration to find alternate funding.",
      "\"We wanted to make sure tribal broadcast services in South Dakota continued to operate which provide potentially lifesaving emergency alerts,\"\u00a0Rounds posted on X. \"We worked with the Trump administration to find Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.\"",
      "Amending the package will mean the House will have to sign off on the changes. And with the Friday deadline, time is running out to do so before the request expires. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday he hoped the Senate sticks with the House-approved package.",
      "\"I think you've got to respect the White House's request, and that's what we did,\" Johnson said.",
      "In the Senate, rescissions bills are not subject to the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, requiring only a simple majority. But with just 53 Republicans, Senate GOP leaders can only afford to lose a handful of their members to approve the package.",
      "President Trump weighed in on the rescissions push late last week, saying in a post on Truth Social that it's \"very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill,\" citing the public broadcasting cuts in particular. The president warned that any Republican who doesn't support the clawback in funding \"will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the rescissions push has sparked frustration among Democrats, who have little ability to stand in its way. But an upcoming spending fight is another story. Democrats have begun suggesting that the GOP effort to claw back already approved congressional funds could have an impact on their willingness to work across the aisle on government funding down the road.",
      "Each year, Congress approves funding to keep the federal government running before the funds are disbursed to government agencies and programs. The rescissions process allows Congress to cancel funds that the federal government has not yet spent.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned about the upcoming rescissions push in a letter to his colleagues upon the return from the Fourth of July recess, arguing that the package's passage \"would be an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process.\" The New York Democrat called it \"absurd\" for the GOP to expect Democrats to engage in a bipartisan appropriations process that could be undermined by rescissions.",
      "\"Republicans are, in effect, proposing Congress negotiate bipartisan deals in the Committee room, while they retreat to a backroom to rubberstamp President Trump's purely partisan scheme that only needs a simple majority to pass to tear up those very same agreements,\" Schumer wrote.",
      "In response, Thune said on the Senate floor last week that he was \"disappointed\" to see Schumer \"implicitly threaten to shut down the government,\" while adding that he's \"hopeful that that is not the position\" of Senate Democrats.",
      "When asked by reporters about the possibility of a shutdown, Schumer said, \"Ask the Republicans why they are heading on this path.\"",
      "\"We are doing everything we can to keep the bipartisan appropriations process going, and they're undermining it with rescissions,\" Schumer added.",

Gavin Newsom's objections \u2014 to respond to protests in the nation's second-largest city.",
      "\"Thanks to our troops who stepped up to answer the call, the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "Around 2,000 Guard troops will be released, Parnell said, or half of the roughly 4,000 who were brought under federal control. About 700 active-duty Marines were also sent to the Los Angeles area last month, part of an effort to protect immigration agents and federal property.",
      "Separately, around 150 Guard members were returned to the state of California earlier this month to help fight wildfires.",
      "In response to Tuesday's decision, Newsom called on the Trump administration to also return the remaining Guard forces.",
      "\"For more than a month, the National Guard has been pulled away from their families, communities and civilian work to serve as political pawns for the President in Los Angeles. While nearly 2,000 of them are starting to demobilize, the remaining guardsmembers continue without a mission, without direction and without any hopes of returning to help their communities,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration argued the deployment was needed to deal with chaotic protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests. But Newsom and other local politicians called the deployment unnecessary and warned it could escalate tensions.",
      "The federal government also accused local law enforcement of not doing enough to protect ICE, which local officials denied.",
      "Mr. Trump took the forces under federal control in early June, following protests against ICE action in Los Angeles. The president said the 60-day mission was intended to quell \"violence and disorder\" and help protect ICE agents and federal property. He invoked a law known as Title 10, which says the president can call Guard troops into federal service to deal with a \"rebellion\" or if \"the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "Newsom sued the Trump administration, calling the deployment an \"unprecedented power grab\" and arguing it was illegal for Mr. Trump to federalize the Guard without his permission. A federal judge initially sided with Newsom, but an appellate court ultimately allowed Mr. Trump to keep the troops in Los Angeles while the legal battle played out, saying the president likely acted within his authority.",
      "During a visit to Los Angeles late last month, Vice President JD Vance called the Guard forces and Marines \"very much a necessary part of what's going on here,\" though he noted the situation in the city had \"gotten a lot better.\"",
      "The vice president also suggested Mr. Trump is willing to send Guard forces to other locales in the U.S. \u2014 but the administration would try not to do so.",
      "\"If you enforce your own laws and if you protect federal law enforcement, we're not going to send in the National Guard because it's unnecessary,\" the vice president said at the time.",

      "The announcement comes amid Musk's public breakup with President Trump and days after Grok generated antisemitic responses and praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "The rollout is part of \"Grok for Government,\" a newly launched suite of tools designed for use by federal agencies, local governments, and national security operations. xAI said its products, including its latest Grok 4 model, will now be available for purchase through the General Services Administration (GSA), allowing any federal office to adopt the technology.",
      "The move aligns with the Trump administration's push for more aggressive adoption of artificial intelligence across the government. Since taking office in January, Mr. Trump has championed AI as a pillar of national security and innovation.",
      "Musk himself briefly served in the Trump administration earlier this year, overseeing the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, before stepping down in May amid a public break with Mr. Trump over his sweeping tax and spending bill. Musk has since emerged as a sharp critic of that legislation, even floating the idea of launching a third political party.",

      "The announcement comes just days after Grok generated antisemitic responses to user prompts and referenced Hitler  as part of what the company called an effort to make the model \"less politically correct.\" Hours later, Musk wrote in a post on X that \"Grok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed.\"",

    "story": [
      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "Warming ocean waters have had a devastating impact on the coral reefs of the Sunshine State. Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",
      "Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators.",
      "\"And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,\" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.",
      "With robust and healthy corals, South Florida's coastal communities are better protected from flooding because the reefs help break up hurricane-fueled waves. The planting of the first Flondurans is just the start of what's needed to rebuild.",
      "\"We need to now scale this up and be out planting hundreds of thousands of baby corals all throughout the reef,\" Baker said. \"And there are ways to do that, but we've got to gear up and get going.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:45:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

      "Astronomers have, for the first time, discovered the moment when planets started to form around a sun-like baby star, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The specks of planet-forming material are emerging around HOPS-315, a protostar or baby star located 1,300 light-years away from us. One light year is approximately 5.88 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have seen discs of gas and dust around protostars before, they've never before identified a new planetary system at such an early stage. Minerals in the system around HOPS-315 are just starting to form.",
      "\"We're seeing a system that looks like what our Solar System looked like when it was just beginning to form,\" study co-author Merel van 't Hoff, a professor at Purdue University, said in a news release from the European Southern Observatory (ESO).",
      "The observatory paired up with NASA's Webb Space Telescope to identify the minerals forming the new solar system. Researchers turned to data from our own solar system to determine that these minerals show the start of a new system. In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",
      "\"So we are watching the beginnings of the construction of planets,\" Bergin said.",
      "With the discovery, Bergin said researchers now know what to look for to find other budding systems.",
      "ESO's Alma telescope network in Chile captured an image of the still-forming planetary system around HOPS-315. In orange, the image shows the distribution of carbon monoxide blowing away from HOPS-315. Blue shows a narrow jet of silicon monoxide, which is also beaming away from the baby star.",
      "Astronomers hope it can help them learn more about the dawn of our solar system.",
      "\"This system is one of the best that we know to actually probe some of the processes that happened in our Solar System,\" van 't Hoff said in a news release.",
      "HOPS-315 is much younger than the Sun; it's about 100,000 years old, Bergin said.",
      "\"So we get a glimpse of the system in its infancy,\" Bergin said in an email. \"Given that the Sun is 4.6 Billion years old this is a baby star that is still gaining mass and getting bigger.\"",

      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",

      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",

      "President Trump and many leaders of the country's largest   technology and energy companies announced more than $90 billion in new investments\u00a0from private companies for Pennsylvania on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 30 minutes during a roundtable discussion at the\u00a0Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit\u00a0at\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, said 20 \"leading technology and energy companies\" will invest in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy, capitalizing on Pennsylvania's technology and energy assets.",
      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Our vision for this event came from the realization about the crucial link between artificial intelligence and energy, but never before have the leaders of all those companies, as well as major investors, come together,\" McCormick said on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted Westinghouse, saying the Pennsylvania-based company is set to build 10 nuclear reactors across the country. He also touted his involvement in consummating a\u00a0$14 billion partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which he said will revitalize the Mon Valley.",
      "Mr. Trump said the investments announced on Tuesday will spawn the development of AI in the region.",
      "\"We're building a future where American workers will forge the steel, produce the energy, build the factories and really run a country like, I believe, this country has never been run before. I think we have a true golden age for America,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We've been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world. I'm honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I'm honored to be in Pittsburgh, and you're going to see some real action here.\"",
      "The organizers hope the investments mark only the beginning, hopeful of leveraging  the summit to ramp up energy production, build more data centers, and spawn new AI companies in the Pittbsurgh area \u2014 making the region the center of AI in the country.",
      "\"We have phenomenal technology resources inside of our universities systems,\" PNC Financial Services Group CEO Bill Demchak said on Tuesday. \"We have an abundance of energy, we have Westinghouse in the area. We have labor availability, and we have a huge need as we see the transformation that AI is causing.\"",
      "The event came after Amazon's announcement in June of a $20 billion investment in data centers across Pennsylvania, the largest economic development project in the state's history.",
      "Major political and industry leaders in Pittsburgh",
      "Several of the president's Cabinet members joined him at the summit.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks were among Trump administration officials listed as summit participants.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was also in attendance. He is participating in a panel about major investments in Pennsylvania, moderated by Penn State University President Dr. Neeli Bendapudi.",
      "Industry leaders like Alphabet President and CEO Ruth Porat, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Blackstone President and CEO Jon Gray, Gecko Robotics founder and CEO Jake Loosararian, EQT President and CEO Toby Rice, and Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman were all listed as panel participants, as well.",
      "Police use pepper spray during Trump protest in Pittsburgh",
      "Mr. Trump's visit was not without pushback, as evidenced on CMU's campus, where signs painted with the words \"protest the summit\" were seen on The Fence.",
      "That sentiment on the CMU Fence was also posted on social media to, in the words of activists, \"call on students and the Pittsburgh community to stand against fossil fuels, AI for surveillance, and authoritarianism.\"",
      "The advocates, who lined the streets across parts of the city, said the summit prioritizes corporate interests over sustainability and ethics.",
      "\"I do believe we should be focusing more on renewable energy, green energy. Just kowtowing to oil and gas is not the way to the future,\" Zach Zourelias of Plum said. \"I'm not saying get rid of it entirely. It is important for Pennsylvania, it is important for the country. But we need to be looking to the future, not the past.\"",
      "Pittsburgh Public Safety said officers used pepper spray on demonstrators outside the event on Tuesday evening.",
      "A spokesperson said police gave dispersal orders to demonstrators blocking the street and confronting attendees leaving the event. The spokesperson said a \"number of demonstrators were actively resisting\" and pushing and shoving officers. That's when two officers deployed pepper spray, officials said.",

      "Elmo's X account posted antisemitic and racist posts after it was hacked on Sunday, a spokesperson for the makers of \"Sesame Street\" said in a statement.",

      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",
      "The posts on Elmo's X account were published several days after the team behind Grok, Elon Musk's xAI chatbot, deleted several posts on Musk's X in which the chatbot made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. The company later issued an apology.",
      "Musk and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, have been criticized for a surge of antisemitic and other hate speech on the site since he took ownership in October 2022. Musk allowed previously banned users back onto the platform \u2014 including\u00a0Andrew Tate,\u00a0Kanye West\u00a0and some notorious neo-Nazi figures \u2014 and reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League has also also been tracking a rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. The nonprofit\u00a0organization  said that last year, it recorded 9,354 antisemitic incidents nationwide, which is the highest number since it started monitoring more than four decades ago.

    "story": [
      "Aaron J. Snoswell is a senior research fellow in AI Accountability at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embedded in X (formerly Twitter) and built by Elon Musk's company xAI, is back in the headlines after\u00a0calling itself \"MechaHitler\" and producing pro-Nazi remarks.",
      "The developers have\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the \"inappropriate posts\" and \"taken action to ban hate speech\" from Grok's posts on X. Debates about AI bias have been revived, too.",
      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAIMusk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAI",
      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:12:58 -0400",
    "summary": "The rescissions revised package passed by a vote of 51-48, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in voting against it.",
    "story": [
      "Before the Senate voted early Thursday morning to pass a rescissions package that includes major cuts to public broadcasting, National Public Radio President and CEO Katherine Maher warned, \"defunding this is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",
      "In June, the White House asked Congress to cancel $9.4 billion in appropriations that had previously been approved. The request, known as the rescissions package, passed in the House in mid-June and would cut roughly $8 billion from international assistance, including organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The Senate added an amendment to exempt $400 million in global health funding for PEPFAR, a program started during the Bush administration to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries.",
      "The revised package passed by a vote of 51-48, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in voting against it.",
      "\"My obligation is to my constituents and to the Constitution,\" Murkowski told reporters after voting against an earlier procedural vote Tuesday.. \"So I look at the Constitution and say that it is \u2026 the legislative branch that has the power of the purse. I take that charge personally, and so I'm going to execute on it.\"",
      "In addition to the foreign assistance cuts, the package includes $1.1 billion in reductions for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "The legislation follows an executive order by President Trump in May directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Board to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, alleging partisan bias.",
      "\"Neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens,\" the order stated.",
      "Maher previously testified before a House subcommittee in March alongside PBS CEO Paula Kerger, where they defended their organizations from the accusations of bias. In her interview this week, Maher reiterated that NPR prioritizes stories that \"directly speak to Americans' political interests and changing beliefs.\"",
      "\"I take all criticism seriously, as I think any news organization should,\" Maher said. \"And if there's a perception that we are not serving the full range of American political life, well we need to, we need to respond to that.\"",
      "Ahead of a Friday deadline, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to support the clawbacks or risk losing his support.",
      "\"It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post this month, using a nickname designed to mock MSNBC. \"Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican senators have voiced concerns about cuts to public broadcasting, especially for those serving rural and Native communities. During Wednesday's vote-a-rama, Sen. Maria Cantwell warned that eliminating funding for CPB could endanger those who rely on radio for emergency information.",
      "\"We're not just putting PBS at risk here, we're putting millions of Americans who depend on local media for life-saving information [at risk],\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in a floor speech. \"And what's in this rescission request is really making sure that public broadcasters don't have that ability, at least in 20 states where they have emergency plans.\"",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a GOP holdout who initially expressed skepticism about the rescissions package, said this week he intends to support it after working with the White House to reallocate unused funding through the Department of the Interior to tribal stations.",
      "\"It will keep them in operation. It will be for one year at a time,\" Rounds said.",
      "The rescissions package comes on the heels of the devastating July 4 floods on Texas' Guadalupe River, which left more than 130 dead and search efforts are still ongoing for more than 100 still unaccounted for.",
      "Since the tragedy, there have been questions about the efficiency of emergency alert systems \u2014 many of which, Maher said, rely on public broadcasting.",
      "Maher said communities in rural areas like that would feel the largest impacts of the funding cuts. She said some NPR stations receive \"more than 50% of their budget\" from federal funds and could face tough decisions, from staffing layoffs to potential station closures.",
      "WDIY, a public radio station in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, has a mix of news and musical programming that is produced by a staff of four along with a host of community volunteers. About 15% of its overall budget comes from CPB funding.",
      "\"Losing that money would mean that we would have to make some serious decisions about do we carry NPR programming anymore because that money helps us pay for that programming,\"\u00a0 WDIY Executive Director Margaret McConnell told CBS News.",
      "Without those smaller stations producing area-specific news and media, Maher cautioned it could become more difficult for such communities to receive information usually provided through local radio.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday will consider the nomination of Emil Bove, President Trump's former defense lawyer and a top Justice Department official, to serve a lifetime appointment as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit.",
      "If Bove clears the GOP-led panel, he will surmount a key hurdle amid staunch opposition from a host of former federal prosecutors and judges, as well as allegations of unethical conduct by a Justice Department whistleblower.",
      "Bove's path to winning approval from the Judiciary Committee became easier earlier this week, when Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told reporters that he was inclined to back his nomination. But it's less clear whether he will be confirmed by the full Senate. Republicans hold 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning the nomination would fail if Bove loses the support of four GOP senators.",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May that he had selected Bove to fill a vacancy on the Philadelphia-based 3rd Circuit, which covers Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Bove was part of the legal team that represented the president in his criminal cases, including the New York hush-money trial and the two federal cases brought by former special counsel Jack Smith.",
      "After Mr. Trump won a second term, he selected Bove to serve as principal associate deputy attorney general. Bove also worked as the acting deputy attorney general while Todd Blanche, the current deputy, awaited confirmation by the Senate.",
      "Bove has been embroiled in controversy since joining the Justice Department. He was accused of pushing a quid pro quo in which the Justice Department would drop its prosecution of New York City Mayor Eric Adams in exchange for commitments on immigration. Several prosecutors resigned in the wake of the move regarding Adams' case.",
      "Bove defended the decision to drop the charges against Adams, telling senators in a questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee that it was \"well within the scope of prosecutorial discretion.\" He also argued that Adams' submissions to the court \"refute false public allegations by third parties regarding some sort of improper quid pro quo.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a former Justice Department attorney who handled immigration cases filed a whistleblower claim with the Senate that accused Bove of suggesting that the administration ignore court orders. The lawyer, Erez Reuveni, worked for more than a decade at the Justice Department and was most recently the acting deputy director of its Office of Immigration Litigation.",
      "He was fired in April after he told a federal judge that the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador had been an administrative error. A top immigration official with the administration had acknowledged in a March court filing that Abrego Garcia's removal was an \"error\" and an \"oversight.\"",
      "Reuveni wrote in his report that during one meeting about Mr. Trump's proclamation invoking the wartime Alien Enemies Act, Bove said that the Justice Department would need to consider telling the courts \"f**k you\" if a judicial order blocked removals under the law.",
      "Emails and text messages shared with the Senate by the whistleblower include exchanges between Reuveni and a colleague at the Justice Department in which they appear to be referring to Bove's alleged directive regarding court orders.",
      "The Justice Department has defended Bove and sought to paint Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee.\" Blanche said the claims about Bove and other top Justice Department officials are \"utterly false.\"",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields has also praised Bove as an \"incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge.\"",
      "During his confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee in June, Bove denied Reuveni's allegations that he urged department attorneys to violate a court order.",
      "But Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel, said that the text messages, email exchanges and other documents show that the Justice Department misled a federal court and disregarded a court order.",

      "The Senate narrowly advanced the request late Tuesday. Three Republicans opposed the package and Vice President JD Vance had to cast the two tie-breaking votes to move it forward.",
      "The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it has faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans have opposed slashing foreign aid and public broadcasting funding.",
      "Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The Senate's decision to consider amendments to the package means the House will need to approve the final Senate version.",

The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS.",
      "Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of the main concerns of Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",

      "\"We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,\" Johnson added.",
      "But the change did not satisfy Collins, who voted against advancing the package. Collins was joined by two other Republicans senators: Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.",

      "\"I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,\" she said. \"We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that.\"",
      "Cuts to local radio and television stations, especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, was another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating \"without interruption.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said he would vote for the package, but expected that Congress would later have to try to fix some of the cuts once they determine the impacts.",
      "\"I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,\" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. \"I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago \u2014 the so-called big, beautiful bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.\"",

      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",

House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",

Shareholders say Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "So-called stablecoins could be a step closer to becoming a mainstream form of payment in the U.S. as the House of Representatives considers a bill regulating the digital currency.",
      "The Genius Act, which passed in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support, would create rules of the road for the $250 billion market for stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency. The bill is also part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "House Republicans on Friday\u00a0announced\u00a0that Monday would be the start of \"Crypto Week,\" when they planned to move forward on three crypto-themed bills. Along with the Genius Act, the legislation includes the\u00a0Clarity\u00a0Act, which would regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins; and the\u00a0Anti-CBDC\u00a0Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backs passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What would the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill would also create a legal category for stablecoins and establish clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "The measure, along with the other crypto bills under consideration, failed in a House vote Tuesday afternoon on procedural grounds, although another vote is possible. But if the Genius Act is passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaits approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks are considering how they can integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Passing the Genius Act would align with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "Reached for comment, the White House referred CBS MoneyWatch to Mr. Trump's statement\u00a0Tuesday on Truth Social about the Genius Act.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding that his administration would work with the Senate and the House to get the legislation passed.",
      "In a Truth Social post Tuesday night, Mr. Trump wrote that he had held a meeting in the Oval Office \"with 11 of the 12 Congressmen/women necessary to pass\" the Genius Act.",

      "Immigrants seeking U visas would contact Patel or another facilitator who would contact Patel, according to an indictment. Patel would then allegedly ask Doyle, Dixon, Onishea and Slaney to produce false police reports saying the immigrants had been the victims of armed robberies. The law enforcement officials would also provide certification and attestation of documents needed for the U visa, the indictment said.",
      "U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said in a news conference that the police officials were paid $5,000 for each name they provided a falsified report for. There were hundreds of names listed on the reports, Van Hook said, creating the appearance of an \"unusual concentration of armed robberies of people who were not from Louisiana.\"",
      "\"In fact, the armed robberies never took place,\" Van Hook said.",
      "Patel also allegedly paid the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office $5,000 in February 2025, \"intending to influence and reward\" an agent who would write him a false police report from that office.",
      "Patel is charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, one count of bribery, 24 counts of mail fraud and eight counts of money laundering. Doyle and Dixon are each charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, six counts of visa fraud, six counts of mail fraud and one count of money laundering. Slaney is charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, six counts of visa fraud, six counts of mail fraud and two counts of money laundering. Onishea is charged with a count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, six counts of visa fraud and six counts of mail fraud.",

      "The conspiracy charge carries a sentence of up to five years in prison. The visa fraud charges have a maximum sentence of 10 years per count. The mail fraud charges have a sentence of up to 20 years in prison per count. The defendants could also be ordered to pay a fine of up to $250,000 per count, and the money laundering charges call for the forfeiture of bank accounts, real estate and vehicles. Patel also faces up to 10 years on the bribery charge.",
      "U visas were introduced in October 2000 as part of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. The act was meant to strengthen law enforcement agencies' ability to investigate and prosecute crimes, while protecting victims who are willing to help investigate them. The Associated Press reported that about 10,000 people received U visas in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, 2022, which was the most recent period that the Department of Homeland Security shared data for.",
      "A Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report published in 2022 warned that the U visa program was not managed effectively and was susceptible to fraud. In 2024, six men were charged with staging armed robberies in multiple states to fraudulently obtain U visa forms.",

      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",

      "June's CPI reading indicates that tariffs might be starting to drive up prices in certain categories. Everyday items, from produce to apparel, could be susceptible to new levies if they are imported from abroad. Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month predicted that tariffs could start to push up prices in the second half of the year.",
      "President Trump recently announced he would issue a flurry of new tariffs on over 20 countries, which he said will take effect on Aug. 1, extending the deadline of a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs that ended earlier this month.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge, said in a report that certain categories exposed to tariffs \u2014 ranging from apparel, home furnishings and appliances to footwear and toys \u2014 saw some upward pricing pressure. But other products vulnerable to higher levies, such as vehicles, remained stable.",
      "EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco estimates that roughly a third of the June rise in the CPI is attributable to higher tariffs.",
      "The muted CPI data from previous months indicates that companies have taken steps to offset the costs of tariffs, largely shielding consumers from price shocks. However, that could change.",
      "\"Strategies used by companies to avoid passing on cost increases to consumers are not eternal,\" Daco noted in a report.",
      "July Fed cut unlikely",
      "Despite the June increase, Wall Street analysts say inflation mostly remains in check.",
      "\"While today's CPI release showed some early signs of tariff impact, on the whole underlying inflation remained muted,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Price pressures, however, are expected to strengthen over the summer and the July and August CPI reports will be important hurdles to clear.\"",
      "Analysts say the latest inflation data points to the Federal Reserve standing pat on interest rates at its meeting later this month. Investors see a more than 97% probability that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate in its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% when officials meet on July 29-30, according to The CME Group's FedWatch\u00a0tool.",
      "\"Today's inflation report all but dashes any remaining hopes that the Fed may cut interest rates at its meeting later this month,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email. \"However, if subsequent inflation readings reiterate the rise in inflation, it could jeopardize future rate cuts as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "Eighty years after a U.S. military airman went missing in World War II, his family received a token to remember him by: a Zippo lighter, inscribed with \"Musashe 1943\" and parts of the service number once assigned to its owner, Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe.",
      "The lighter came into the family's possession after one of the airman's relatives spotted it in a Facebook post about a year ago, the sergeant's nephew, Vince Musashe, told the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which is a branch of the U.S. Department of Defense tasked with finding and identifying service members who were either missing in action or prisoners of war during past conflicts.",
      "In the post, shared in 2019 by a Facebook group called the \"Great Lakes Lighter Club,\" a Swiss man who collected lighters showed an installment in his collection. It was the Zippo lighter with Musashe's last name and 27 hash marks that military historians believe represented the airman's 27 missions during the war. They suggested the lighter may have been recovered from Musashe's remains or from the wreckage of his aircraft, which was attacked in 1944, according to DPAA.",
      "Musashe was last seen on April 19 of that year, when he was among a group of American airmen dispatched to bomb part of Berlin. German fire damaged his aircraft, which changed course and accidentally ended up passing over then-occupied Denmark, where the pilot ordered crew members including Musashe to bail out.",
      "Exactly how many of the 10 crew members actually exited the aircraft in parachutes has been debated. Officials say no remains or records related to the deaths of Musashe or one other crew member were ever found, and a finding of death was issued to Musashe's family on Nov. 7, 1945.",
      "DPAA historians helped the family locate the Zippo lighter's new owner after seeing that Facebook post. They contacted the man, Swiss army veteran Rolf Gerster, who eventually turned it over to them.",
      "\"He felt strongly that the lighter belonged with our family and was happy to be part of bringing a part of my uncle home,\" said Vince Musashe, according to DPAA. \"He was extremely helpful in arranging the transfer, telling me the best way to make sure it got to the United States safe and sound. He tracked the shipment and kept me informed at each stage.\"",
      "The deceased airman's nephew told DPAA he brought the Zippo to his uncle's sister, 95-year-old Virginia Zoller, who last saw her brother when she was in 7th grade.",
      "\"She clutched the lighter as if she was hugging her brother,\" said Vince Musashe. \"After 81 years, she did what she said she would do when he came home. She kissed the lighter. She was just so happy that she lived to see this.\"",

      "The agency's modeling suggests that the uptick is in \"many\" Southeast, Southern and West Coast states, the CDC said in its weekly update.",
      "COVID-19 activity nationwide, however, is still considered \"low,\" based on data from wastewater samples, although that is up from \"very low\" the week before.",
      "Some of the highest rates of COVID-19 in emergency rooms are in the Pacific Northwest, which saw a steep rise in ER visits during June, and in the Southeast, which has seen rates steadily inch up for weeks. Rates are now the highest they've been since February and March in those regions.",
      "Health officials have been watching for an increase in COVID-19 this summer, as new variants have spread to the U.S. after fueling surges overseas.",
      "A CDC analysis published Thursday concluded that the virus has settled into twice-a-year surges nationwide, typically peaking first in July through September and then a second time later in December through February.",
      "Those surges look to be linked to cycles of genetic changes to a part of the virus that scientists call the S1 region, a key part of the spike protein of the virus that binds to human cells.",
      "\"Our analysis revealed biannual COVID-19 peaks in late summer and winter, a pattern that is expected to persist as long as the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and cyclical S1 diversity continues,\" the scientists wrote in the CDC analysis.",
      "COVID-19's rise comes as health officials have been probing reports of an unusual uptick in another respiratory virus called parvovirus B19. While many people develop no symptoms from parvovirus B19 infections, some people get sick with signs like fever and muscle pains, followed by a rash.",
      "The CDC warned late last month of a \"sustained increase\" in transmission of parvovirus B19, and suggested that pregnant women consider masking to curb the risk of severe complications. Some local health departments have also tracked a rise in emergency rooms treating cases of this virus.",

About 360 of those were evacuated using UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.",

      "After the flight, both Abbott and Nordhaus spoke to members of the Guard who have assisted in rescue and recovery efforts since the floods began on July 4.",

      "The 130 rescued the day of the flood by the guard were evacuated from Camp Mystic and taken to higher ground, according to Captain Connor Garrison, who led one of the aircraft and recounted the mission to Nordhaus and Abbott.",
      "\"I appreciate you, I couldn't be prouder,\" Abbott told Garrison and other members of the Guard.",
      "The Texas National Guard is receiving support from other states like Arkansas, Arizona and North Dakota, which are providing additional personnel or equipment. For instance, North Dakota has sent down one of its own MQ-9 Reaper drones to help survey debris scattered along the still swollen Guadalupe River.",

Israel's attack came hours after a drone strike on the same building. Syrian state media reported a \"number of casualties\" without giving further details.",
      "As clashes have raged for days in the city of Sweida, the capital of the province of the same name, between government forces and Druze armed groups, Israel has launched a series of strikes targeting government troops and convoys, which it says are in support of the religious minority group, and has vowed to escalate its involvement.",
      "It has also beefed up its forces along its border with Syria.",

      "The U.S. lifted a wide range of sanctions against Syria in late June, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the moves were intended to encourage investment in the country.",
      "\"Syria must also continue to work towards becoming a stable country that is at peace, and today's actions will hopefully put the country on a path to a bright, prosperous, and stable future,\" Bessent said at the time.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration was \"very concerned about Israel's strikes in Syria,\" adding: \"We are talking with all relevant parties on all sides. We want the fighting to stop.\"",
      "Rubio called the clashes around Sweida \"a direct threat to efforts to help build a peaceful and stable Syria,\" adding: \"We have been and remain in repeated and constant talks with the governments of Syria and Israel on this matter.\"",
      "A rebel offensive led by Islamist insurgent groups ousted Syria's longtime despotic leader, Bashar Assad, in December, sending him fleeing into exile in Russia and bringing an end to a nearly 14-year civil war. Since then, the country's new rulers have struggled to consolidate control.",
      "The primarily Sunni Muslim government has faced suspicion from Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, whose fears increased after clashes between government forces and pro-Assad armed groups in March spiraled into sectarian revenge attacks. Hundreds of civilians of the Alawite religious minority, to which Assad belongs, were killed.",
      "Syria's Defense Ministry had earlier blamed militias in the Druze-majority area of Sweida for violating a ceasefire agreement that had been reached Tuesday, causing Syrian army soldiers to return fire. It said they were \"adhering to rules of engagement to protect residents, prevent harm, and ensure the safe return of those who left the city back to their homes.\"",
      "But reports of attacks on civilians continued to surface, and Druze with family members in the conflict zone searched desperately for information about their fate amid communication blackouts.",
      "Claims of government forces attacking Druze civilians",
      "In Jaramana near the Syrian capital, Evelyn Azzam, 20, said she fears that her husband, Robert Kiwan, 23, is dead. The newlyweds live in the Damascus suburb, but Kiwan would commute to Sweida for work each morning and got trapped there when the clashes erupted.",
      "Azzam said she was on the phone with Kiwan when security forces questioned him and a colleague about whether they were affiliated with Druze militias. When her husband's colleague raised his voice, she heard a gunshot. Kiwan was then shot while trying to intervene.",
      "\"They shot my husband in the hip from what I could gather,\" she said, struggling to hold back tears. \"The ambulance took him to the hospital. Since then, we have no idea what has happened.\"",
      "A Syrian Druze from Sweida living in the United Arab Emirates said her mother, father, and sister were hiding in a basement in their home near the hospital, where they could hear the sound of shelling and bullets from outside. She spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear her family might be targeted.",
      "She had struggled to get hold of them, but when she reached them, she said, \"I heard them cry. I have never heard them this way before.\"",
      "Another Druze woman living in the UAE with family members in Sweida, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said a cousin told her that a house where their relatives lived had been burned down with everyone inside it.",
      "It reminded her of when ISIS extremists attacked Sweida in 2018, she said. Her uncle was among many civilians there who took up arms to fight back while Assad's forces stood aside. He was killed in the fighting.",
      "\"It's the same right now,\" she told The Associated Press. The Druze fighters, she said, are \"just people who are protecting their province and their families.\"",
      "Who are the Druze, and why would Israel defend them?",
      "The Druze religious sect began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",
      "The latest escalation in Syria began with a series of tit-for-tat kidnappings and attacks involving local Sunni Bedouin tribes and Druze armed factions in the southern province. Government forces that intervened to restore order then clashed with the Druze.",
      "Videos surfaced on social media of government-affiliated fighters forcibly shaving the mustaches of Druze sheikhs, and stepping on Druze flags and pictures of religious clerics. Other videos showed Druze fighters beating captured government forces and posing by their dead bodies. AP reporters in the area saw burned and looted houses.",
      "No official casualty figures have been released since Monday, when the Syrian Interior Ministry said 30 people had been killed. U.K.-based monitoring organization, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said more than 250 people had been killed as of Wednesday morning, including four children, five women and 138 soldiers and security forces.",
      "The observatory said at least 21 people were killed in \"field executions.\"",
      "Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a statement Wednesday condemning the violations.",

      "In Israel, the Druze are seen as a loyal minority and often serve in the military. In Syria, the Druze have been divided over how to deal with the country's new leaders, with some advocating for integrating into the new system while others remained suspicious and pushed for an autonomous Druze region.",
      "On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Katz said in a statement that the Israeli army \"will continue to attack regime forces until they withdraw from the area \u2014   and will also soon raise the bar of responses against the regime if the message is not understood.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday night that Israel has \"a commitment to preserve the southwestern region of Syria as a demilitarized area on Israel's border\" and has \"an obligation to safeguard the Druze locals.\"",

      "In a statement, they said he was killed in a confrontation with settlers while trying to protect his family's land in the town of Sinjil, north of Ramallah, and that the settlers had surrounded him for more than three hours, blocking an ambulance and paramedics from reaching him.",

      "\"Israel must immediately stop these killings, harassment and home demolitions across the occupied Palestinian territory,\" Al-Kheetan said. \"As the occupying power, Israel must take all feasible measures to ensure public order and safety in the West Bank. It is under the obligation to protect Palestinians from settler attacks and to end the unlawful use of force by its security forces. There must be thorough, independent and transparent investigations into all killings and all other alleged violations of international law. Those responsible must be held to account.\"",

      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "After the plot failed, violent Bolsonaro supporters rioted, rampaging through government buildings in the capital Brasilia in scenes that echoed the Jan. 6, 2021 assault on the U.S. Capitol by Mr. Trump's supporters after the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "The trial has attracted attention from Mr. Trump, who returned to power in the 2024 election and continues to claim \u2014   despite this being rejected repeatedly by the courts \u2014   that he won in 2020. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on social media for Bolsonaro's trial to be stopped, accusing the authorities in Brazil of mounting a \"witch hunt\" and a \"disgrace.\"",
      "On July 9, he took his campaign to extraordinary new levels by announcing plans to tariff Brazilian imports to the U.S. at 50%, again citing what he called a \"witch hunt\" against Bolsonaro. And on Tuesday, Washington said it was opening an investigation into \"unfair trading practices\" by Brazil, a move that could provide a legal basis to justify imposing tariffs on South America's largest economy.",
      "Unlike the tariffs that Mr. Trump is slapping on countries around much of the world, including top U.S. allies, the measures against Brazil \u2014   which are set to take effect on August 1 \u2014   were announced in openly political terms.",
      "Mr. Trump cited \"Brazil's insidious attacks on Free Elections,\" among other issues, warning of further escalation if the country retaliated \u2014 something Lula indicated would happen.",
      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump reiterated his claim that Bolsonaro was being unfairly treated.",
      "\"They're treating President Bolsonaro very unfairly,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, calling him \"a good man.\"",
      "\"I know the honest ones, and I know the crooked ones,\" he added.",
      "Lula has hit back at Mr. Trump's \"interference,\" insisting that \"no one is above the law.\"",

      "Wilawan Emsawat, in her mid-30s, was arrested at her home in Nonthaburi province north of the capital Bangkok on charges including extortion, money laundering and receiving stolen goods. Police said they traced money transferred to her by a senior monk from a bank account belonging to his temple in northern Thailand.",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",

The legendary naval leader earned the moniker \"Tenacious Tanaka\" among U.S. forces for leading dangerous attacks and so-called \"Tokyo Express\" supply missions during the middle of the night.",
      "Weeks before descending to its watery grave, the Teruzuki used its state-of-the-art weaponry to great effect. In November 1942, the 400-foot-long Akizuki-class destroyer used its rapid-fire 100mm guns to help sink two U.S. destroyers,\u00a0according to the U.S. Naval Institute. The Teruzuki's torpedoes also severely damaged two other U.S. battleships.",
      "But on Dec. 12, 1942, the Teruzuki was targeted by American PT boats as it tried to protect a convoy of supply ships on Guadalcanal's northern coast, according to historians. The Teruzuki was hit by two U.S. torpedoes, breaking its rudder and disabling the ship. Most of the crew were rescued or swam ashore, but nine men died as the Teruzuki plunged to the bottom of the ocean.",
      "A remotely operated camera launched by the Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus brought the first glimpse of the ship since that day when it spotted the wreck on July 10, the trust said. The massive warship had been severed, with its stern and hull 650 feet apart on the seafloor \u2014 but its munitions were still intact.",
      "An eerie video released by the trust shows the stern armed with multiple depth charges. One scientist can be heard on the video saying that an expert warned the team to be \"extra careful as some Japanese ordnance at this time of the war had a reputation for being really sensitive.\"",
      "The team also noted that the ship was found with its forward artillery turrets pointing skyward.",
      "\"When the exploration team found a 19-meter-long severed segment of Teruzuki's stern littered with depth charges, it disproved a long-held theory that it was depth charge explosions that sealed the ship's fate,\" the trust said in a separate news release.",
      "Ship located in Iron Bottom Sound",
      "Iron Bottom Sound in the Solomon Islands was the site of five pivotal naval battles between August and December 1942.",
      "Located about 600 northeast of Australia, the Solomon Islands became coveted territory for both Japan and the Allied Forces during World War II. The tiny island of Guadalcanal was key because of its airfield and its location, which offered command over shipping lanes in the region.",
      "\"Recognizing this island and airfield's strategic value, both sides would soon commit substantial naval and air resources to control the island, the airfield, and its surrounding waters,\" the Ocean Exploration Trust  said.",
      "Dozens of warships were sunk in Iron Bottom Sound, and the Teruzuki is just the latest to be discovered. Earlier this month, the same researchers found the severed bow of the American warship USS New Orleans during seafloor mapping operations in the area.",
      "In addition to the Teruzuki, at least six Japanese warships were lost off Guadalcanal between August and December 1942, according to the trust, and at least 10 Allies ships were lost during the same period.",
      "One of the American vessels lost in the area was the USS Laffey, a Benson-class destroyer that survived a major battle in October 1942 but was sunk in Guadalcanal on Nov. 12, 1942. One of the ships that sank USS Laffey was in fact the Teruzuki, which had only seen combat for a few months until its demise.",
      "The designs and details of Japanese naval ships were cloaked in secrecy during World War II. There are no historical images of the\u00a0  Teruzuki, making the new discovery especially revealing, the trust said.",
      "\"I feel so lucky to see this ship. The fact that we have not seen Teruzuki in over 80 years underscores the importance of recording maritime heritage now,\" said Hiroshi Ishii, a Nautilus science team member and researcher at Kyoto University. \"As a Japanese person, I appreciate the opportunity to witness part of our history and to be part of an international team shedding light on this campaign, which is important to all of our nations' history.\"",
      "In 2023, the wreckage of a Japanese ship that was torpedoed during World War II off the coast of the Philippines was found. The ship was carrying Allied prisoners of war, most of them Australians, when it sank in 1942. All 1,080 people aboard perished.",

    "summary": "Two black holes merged into one massive one, scientists from an international collaborative group said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland. Data from the observation window will be published later in the summer. The data used to detect and study the massive black hole will also be made available for other researchers to use, the collaboration said.",

I'd never met him before. I've not seen him since.\"",
      "The actor explained that he flew on one of Epstein's planes during a humanitarian trip with former President Bill Clinton.\u00a0 (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images)",
      "Spacey explained that in 2015, he began seeing reports and social media posts that he had \"flown to Jeffrey Epstein's island\" and he had \"abused young girls.\" The actor claimed that he had not known of Epstein until that point.",
      "\"I have since learned who he is, and I have been able to go back and find out that the airplane that we flew on for this humanitarian mission was owned by Jeffrey Epstein. And then learned, \u2018Oh, he was actually on some of those flights.\u2019 And this Maxwell woman was on some of those fights. I didn't know him. I've never spent any time with him. I was with the Clinton Foundation people. That's who I was with.\"",
      "He continued, \"This Maxwell woman, she was one of many people that sat down next to me in that throne room. I have no relationship with her. I had no relationship with him. He's not my friend, I'm not a confidante, I've never spent time with him.\"",
      "Jeffrey Epstein is pictured in a 2019 mugshot after federal authorities filed trafficking charges against him.\u00a0 (Kypros/Getty Images)",
      "However, Spacey claimed that he was concerned for Clinton since he claimed there were \"young girls\" on the flights during their trips with Epstein.",
      "\"I didn't want to be around this guy because I felt he put the president at risk on that trip to South Africa because there were these young girls,\" he said. \"And we were like, \u2018Who is this guy?\u2019 So I will say this \u2014 there were young girls on those flights.\"",
      "\"And that's been out,\" he continued. \"They've talked about it. But here's my point. There's a big difference between not remembering that I met some guy and some woman on a humanitarian trip where my focus was entirely on what we were there to do, and not remembering whether I went to somebody's island. So I never went to Jeffrey Epstein's island.\"",
      "Spacey previously faced accusations of sexual assault.\u00a0 (Yuki Iwamura)",
      "Spacey concluded by telling Morgan that he had never seen Epstein or Maxwell again since the trip and the Buckingham Palace visit.",
      "Epstein, who was a convicted child sex predator, died in a prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges of sex-trafficking minors. In 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking ring.",

      "In 2017, Spacey was accused of sexual misconduct by several men. Actor Anthony Rapp was the first to come forward, alleging that Spacey made a sexual advance toward him at a party in 1986, when Rapp was 14 and the \"The Usual Suspects\" star was 27. Spacey has denied all allegations against him.",
      "The actor subsequently lost his leading role on Netflix's \"House of Cards\" and faced a number of lawsuits brought by the alleged victims. In 2022, a federal jury found Spacey not liable for assaulting Rapp in a civil lawsuit that the \"Star Trek: Discovery\" star filed against him. The following year, Spacey was acquitted of nine charges of sexual assault from four men after a trial in the U.K.",

      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "Others may get absorbed in an activity (a symptom known as hyperfocus), losing track of time completely, the expert noted.",

      "Time blindness is most commonly linked to ADHD, but it can also arise with other neurological conditions. (iStock)",
      "Time blindness is not listed in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is the accepted reference book for mental health and brain-related conditions, Singer noted.",
      "While there is no formal diagnosis for the condition, the inability to perceive and manage time is included in the DSM-5 criterion for ADHD.",

      "Treating time blindness often involves a multi-layered approach, starting with minimizing delays, according to Sivanathan.",

      "The longer timeline is likely a welcome relief for Abrego Garcia's lawyers as they continue to wait for U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland, to issue an order blocking ICE from immediately deporting their client to a third country pending release from U.S. criminal custody.",
      "Judge Xinis, who has presided over the civil case since March, suggested after a days-long evidentiary hearing Friday that she planned to issue a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to keep Abrego Garcia in custody for a set amount of time before they can deport him to a third country, such as Mexico or South Sudan, as officials indicated last week that they plan to do.",
      "Much of Wednesday's hearing played out similarly to Abrego's arraignment in June, led by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes. Judge Holmes had ruled that Abrego Garcia should be released pending trial in the criminal case, though she later agreed to a request from his attorneys to keep him in federal custody to avoid deportation.",

      "Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to those charges, and was ordered released pending trial by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes.",
      "Senior Justice Department officials and ICE officials conceded to this plan last week, telling U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland that the government would immediately begin removal proceedings to deport Abrego Garcia to a third country, regardless of the status of his criminal case. In doing so, they broke with previous assertions from U.S. officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, who vowed when he was returned that he would remain in U.S. custody for the duration of his trial and any prison time.",

When compared to the biggest 3D-printed building we know of, these schools are 40 times bigger. They will be built on 328-by-328-foot plots. Therefore, making this project one of unprecedented scale for the region.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Qatar's desert formations were the inspiration behind the architectural design of the schools. They have wavy walls that look like dunes, something that can only be made possible through 3D printing. Building these unique curved shapes would be too expensive and difficult with traditional construction methods.",
      "UCC Holdings and COBOD construction teams launch Qatar\u2019s 3D Printed Schools Project. (UCC Holding)",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed school project goes beyond architectural innovation; it also marks a major step toward sustainable construction. 3D printing technology reduces material waste by up to 60% compared to traditional building methods. It also minimizes labor requirements and shortens construction timelines, leading to lower overall emissions and energy use.",
      "Moreover, the ability to print complex, curved designs, like the dune-inspired walls of these schools, proves how digital construction methods can unlock new levels of creativity while staying cost-efficient. This approach not only supports Qatar's environmental goals but also sets a new global standard for eco-friendly building design.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Qatar's 3D-printed schools will be complete by the end of 2025 and demonstrate just how far construction technology has come. By combining both imaginative design and cutting-edge engineering, this project sets the standard for sustainable, scalable and future-ready educational infrastructure. Furthermore, it\u2019s an impressive milestone for the region, and a blueprint for how nations worldwide can rethink how buildings are made using the latest technologies.",

    "story": [
      "Police forces around the world are adding AI-powered robots.",
      "In a groundbreaking fusion of nature and technology, researchers at the University of Queensland have developed remote-controlled beetles equipped with tiny, removable backpacks that could drastically reduce the time it takes to locate survivors in disaster zones.",
      "Also known as cyborg beetles, these hybrid helpers are part of an ambitious project to improve emergency response in situations like building collapses, earthquakes or industrial explosions. By combining natural mobility with simple controls, researchers are developing a faster, more flexible way to reach people in hard-to-access areas.",

      "A close-up of a cyborg beetle with mounted electronics. (University of Queensland)",
      "How cyborg beetles could navigate disaster zones better than robots",
      "The team\u2019s innovation involves fitting darkling beetles, or Zophobas morio, their scientific name, with microchip backpacks that deliver small electrical signals to guide their movement. These signals stimulate either the beetle\u2019s antennae or their hardened forewings, prompting them to turn, stop or climb. The researchers even demonstrated real-time control using a standard video game controller.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Robots at this scale still struggle with climbing vertical surfaces and navigating uneven terrain. These beetles, on the other hand, are naturally built for it. Their footpads and sensory systems let them crawl through narrow cracks and over rubble. This makes them well-suited for the unpredictable conditions found in disaster zones.",
      "Beetles were chosen for their strength, agility and resilience. Despite their small size, they can carry equipment nearly equal to their own body weight, which makes them an ideal platform for compact sensors and control systems in tight, dangerous spaces.",
      "A cyborg beetle with a microchip backpack climbs over a rock\u2019s surface. (University of Queensland)",
      "How biology is shaping the next generation of rescue tech",
      "Unlike custom-built robots, these beetles don\u2019t need motors or gears to move. Their natural ability to climb, squeeze and maneuver through tight spaces eliminates the need for complex mechanical systems. The programmable backpack simply adds directional control without harming the beetle or shortening its lifespan. The result is a biological tool that can access places humans and machines cannot. This could help reduce the time it takes to locate survivors in critical situations.",

The goal is to create a lightweight, mobile, and affordable tool that can deliver real-time information from inside collapsed structures and hazardous environments. The team hopes to test the system in a live emergency simulation within the next five years. If successful, cyborg beetles could become a valuable part of urban response efforts around the world.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Researchers are proving that cyborg beetles could play a real role in saving lives. By guiding beetles through tight, dangerous spaces using tiny backpacks and simple controls, scientists are exploring a low-cost and high-impact way to locate survivors where robots and humans can't go. The technology is still in development, but the potential is clear, especially in situations where every second counts.",

      "What if the answer to cleaner energy was right out on the waves? A new green energy system is set to change how we capture clean power, and it all starts with the ocean. French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out.

      "Bank of America and other big institutions are seeing major customer engagement with their AI-powered chatbots.",
      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "What you need to know about AI phishing attacks",
      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",
      "Wikipedia page showing ChatGPT description on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web.

      "AI chatbots often sound confident even when they are wrong. If a chatbot tells you where to log in, do not click the link right away. Instead, go directly to the website by typing its URL manually or using a trusted bookmark.",
      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

    "summary": "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",

      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",

      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "Whether you're thinking about signing up or are already enrolled, these steps will help you stay in control, protect your comfort and avoid unwanted surprises:",
      "Before you join any power saver or thermostat program, read the terms completely. Ensure you understand the extent of the utility's control, whether you can override changes and how frequently adjustments may occur. Always choose manual enrollment during smart home app setup instead of letting it enroll you automatically.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Use a Wi-Fi thermostat that makes it easy to override changes during demand response events. Many models let you opt out temporarily or permanently through the app or the device itself. Learn how to do this before a peak event occurs, so you're not caught off guard.",
      "Find expert-reviewed smart thermostats that put you in control at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/SmartThermostats",
      "Turn on alerts from your utility so you receive notifications about peak demand events by email, text or app. Check your utility\u2019s website for schedules or forecasts and opt out in advance if needed. Staying informed gives you more control over how your system behaves.",
      "Use strong passwords for your thermostat and home Wi-Fi. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA) if available. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

      "Every tattoo starts with a single black dot. That tiny mark is the base for every design, no matter how complex. And now, thanks to a new AI tattoo machine, that dot is more perfect than ever. Welcome to the future of tattooing.",

      "AI tattoo machine (Blackdot)",
      "What is the Blackdot AI tattoo machine and how does it work?",
      "Blackdot is not just a new tool. It's a complete reimagining of how tattoos are created. This device doesn't look like a traditional tattoo machine. It's a sleek, robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. It uses computer vision, lasers and a microscope to apply ink with surgical precision. The dots it places are about the size of a human hair. Blackdot is currently in studios like Bang Bang in New York City. It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. (Blackdot)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "Every day, millions of people install tiny browser add-ons they believe will improve productivity or entertainment.

Many glance at shiny verification badges and five-star ratings, assume the vetting process was solid, and click \"Install\" without thinking twice.",

First, they released functional and legitimate utilities to gain user trust. Over time, these extensions collected positive reviews and built a solid reputation. Then, after months or even years of quiet operation, the attackers pushed a silent update that injected malicious scripts into the trusted codebase.",
      "Since these updates came directly from official sources, they easily bypassed corporate firewalls. Unlike phishing emails or shady downloads, the malicious code arrived through routine, automatic updates and raised no immediate red flags.",
      "How malicious Chrome extensions evade detection and spread",
      "As the investigation progressed, researchers traced suspicious traffic back to a seemingly harmless color picker extension. This led them to a cluster of connected domains, each acting as a command and control hub. These servers recorded every URL users visited and issued commands to force redirects to fake websites or ad-heavy landing pages.",
      "Next, the team analyzed the extension\u2019s code more closely and uncovered matching fingerprints in several unrelated tools. These included weather widgets, emoji keyboards, video speed controllers and volume boosters. Although they appeared different on the surface, they shared underlying code and behavior.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Together, these extensions reached over two million installations.

      "The major convenience and cost-cutting feature of these tiny tower homes is that they come prefabricated. They are built off-site in Germany, transported to the site, and settled into place with a small crane crew. As of now, it takes about eight months from order to delivery. The whole structure is constructed with a sturdy steel frame, well-insulated walls, and clad in chic aluminum panels.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The DQ Tower is more than just a tiny home. It offers a bold vision for how people can live in smaller spaces without giving up comfort or style. Although it is not currently available in the United States, it provides a clear picture of where compact, vertical living could be headed. As cities become more crowded and backyard space gains value, this European design could inspire the next generation of American prefab housing.",

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower. This technology allows robots to scan containers and generate accurate 3D models of the objects inside by analyzing how signals bounce back from hidden surfaces.",

      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "We may be entering an era where robots don't just move boxes, but they understand what's in them.

      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",

      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Tesla delivers on solar Supercharger vision with off-grid charging station",
      "Tesla has long promised to integrate solar panels and battery storage into its Supercharger stations. CEO Elon Musk envisioned a network where most stations could operate off-grid, powered by renewable energy. While a few stations received solar upgrades over the years, most remained reliant on conventional electricity sources. Now, with the Oasis project, Tesla is finally delivering on that promise in a big way.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Inside the Oasis Supercharger: Tesla\u2019s largest solar EV charging hub",
      "The Oasis Supercharger is truly massive. It will eventually offer 168 charging stalls, with half of them already operational. The station is powered by an impressive 11 megawatts of solar panels, which include both ground-mounted arrays and solar canopies. These panels cover 30 acres of land, making it one of the largest solar-powered EV charging stations in the world. To store the energy generated by the solar farm, Tesla has installed 10 Megapacks, which together provide 39 megawatt-hours of battery capacity.",
      "What makes Oasis especially remarkable is its ability to operate completely off the grid. This means it can provide reliable charging even during power outages or in remote locations where grid access is limited. Tesla brought 84 stalls online just in time for the busy Fourth of July travel weekend, and the remaining stalls, along with a new driver lounge, are expected to open later this year.",
      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Why Tesla\u2019s solar-powered Oasis Supercharger is a game-changer",
      "This project is important for several reasons. First, it significantly reduces the strain on local utility grids by generating and storing its own energy. This makes the charging station more resilient and less vulnerable to power disruptions.",
      "Second, it proves that large-scale, solar-powered EV infrastructure is not only feasible but practical. As electric vehicles become more popular, the demand for sustainable and reliable charging options will grow, and Oasis offers a clear vision of how to meet that demand.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Tesla's Oasis Supercharger sets a new standard for the industry. It shows that EV charging stations can be fully powered by renewable energy and operate independently from the grid. This approach could transform how we think about fueling electric vehicles and help accelerate the transition to clean transportation.",
      "Regulatory challenges could slow future off-grid EV charging projects",
      "Despite this impressive achievement, challenges remain. Recent changes in U.S. legislation have reduced incentives for solar energy and battery storage projects. These policy shifts could slow down the development of similar off-grid charging stations across the country. As a result, the expansion of renewable energy and EV infrastructure might face headwinds in the near future.",
      "The Oasis Supercharger\u00a0 (Tesla)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Tesla's Oasis Supercharger really shows us what's possible for the future of EV charging. It brings together clean energy, smart technology, and real-world reliability in a way we haven't seen before. But with new regulations and so much demand for charging, it makes you wonder, will other companies and governments step up and build more solar-powered, off-grid stations like this? Or is Oasis going to stand alone as a rare example, while most charging stations keep relying on traditional energy?",

      "What are swappable EV batteries?",
      "Swappable EV batteries are modular battery packs that can be quickly exchanged instead of recharged. CATL, a global leader in battery technology, created a system called Choco-SEB that allows drivers to replace a drained battery in about 100 seconds. This makes battery swapping a realistic alternative to traditional EV charging.",
      "Swappable EV battery on screen at launch event\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "How CATL's Choco-SEB battery system works",

      "EV battery swapping station\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "Why swappable EV batteries could change the industry",
      "Swappable EV batteries address one of the biggest challenges facing electric vehicles: long charging times. Instead of waiting 30 minutes or more, drivers can swap batteries in minutes and get back on the road with the ease of a gas-powered car.",
      "The concept is gaining traction in Asian markets and holds promise for global expansion. In the U.S., however, challenges such as vehicle compatibility, automaker collaboration, infrastructure needs and consumer acceptance remain significant.",
      "Some U.S.-based pilots and partnerships, including Stellantis collaborating with Ample for a fleet in Spain, point to growing interest. Still, CATL's Choco-SEB battery swap system has not been announced for rollout in the U.S.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, taking your eyes off the road for just five seconds at 55 mph is like driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed.

      "A Texas man on death row is now scheduled to be put to death in October for his conviction in the death of his 2-year-old daughter in 2002, after his execution was delayed last year amid concerns about whether he is guilty.",
      "Robert Roberson's new execution date was set for Oct. 16 at 6 p.m., according to Judge Austin Reeve Jackson, who said it's the \"reality of where we are.\" The new execution date is a year after his initial execution date was paused after a push from a bipartisan group of state lawmakers, among others.",
      "Attorneys for Roberson, 58, criticized the judge's ruling, arguing that substantial evidence shows he did not kill his daughter, Nikki Curtis, more than two decades ago in a case of the shaken baby hypothesis they say has been widely discredited.",

Robert did not kill her. There was no crime,\" she continued.",
      "More than 80 state lawmakers, as well as the detective who helped the prosecution, medical experts, parental rights groups, human rights groups, bestselling novelist John Grisham and other advocates have called for the state to grant Roberson clemency over the belief that he is innocent. A group of state lawmakers also visited Roberson in prison last year to encourage him.",

      "Roberson was convicted after prosecutors argued he killed his daughter by shaking her to death. But his lawyers have said Nikki actually died from other health issues such as pneumonia and that new evidence proves his innocence. His lawyers also said doctors had failed to rule out these other medical explanations for the child's symptoms.",
      "\"I believe he is innocent for two distinct reasons,\" Sween told Fox News Digital last year. \"The theory that there was a crime that was used to convict him, which was then known as the shaken baby syndrome hypothesis, has been thoroughly discredited. There is no one now who would say the version of that hypothesis that was put before his jury as if it were scientific fact is legitimate.\"",
      "\"Also, I know from the experts that had dug into his daughter's medical records and examined the evidence that this exceedingly ill child died from undiagnosed pneumonia that was [ravaging] her lungs, combined with very dangerous prescription medications she was given in the last few days of her life,\" she continued. \"And it's not to suggest that doctors did this intentionally. It's just they didn't know about the pneumonia.\"",

When the Jews emerged victorious, 156,000 Arabs remained within what became Israel.

      "The comments coincided with the 10-year anniversary of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was originally intended to halt Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, but which some have argued was insufficient to adequately deter Tehran.",
      "Under the terms of the JCPOA, any signatory can unilaterally call up snapback sanctions if Iran is found to have violated the terms of the agreement.",
      "Though the U.S., which, alongside the U.K., France, Germany, China and Russia, signed the 2015 deal, was deemed by the U.N. and other JCPOA members unable to utilize the mechanism after Washington withdrew from the agreement in 2018 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Despite repeated calls by the U.S. to enforce snapback \u2013 which would legally enforce all 15 U.N. members on the council, including Russia, to reimpose sanctions on Iran \u2013 no one on the UNSC or JCPOA has yet taken steps to enforce the sanctions.",

      "Ben Taleblu explained that Iran\u2019s most likely response to the severe sanctions under the snapback mechanism would be its abandonment of the\u00a0Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\u00a0(NPT) \u2013 an international agreement that over 190 nations have signed, pledging either not to transfer weapons to another recipient by nuclear-capable nations, or not to develop atomic arms by non-nuclear nations, among other commitments.",

      "\"The problem is the lack of a game plan. Has America provided Europe with a game plan, a road map for post-snapback?\" he added, noting there needs to be a much larger strategy for next steps should sanctions be reinforced.",
      "Though the U.S. assesses that Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been stunted by up to two years, experts remain convinced that Tehran\u2019s atomic ambitions have not been deterred, and its ties to terrorist networks and adversarial nations mean it remains a top security concern.",
      "Trump has said he is still committed to negotiating with Iran on its nuclear program, though questions remain over how long he will continue to allow negotiations to drag out before a European nation like the U.K., France or Germany must step in to enact snapback sanctions not only before the October deadline, but before Russia takes over control of the UNSC presidency that month.",

      "It has been 4,000 days since Hadar Goldin, a 23-year-old Israeli soldier and budding artist, was ambushed and killed by Hamas terrorists during a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza.",
      "His remains have never been returned.",
      "For his mother, Leah Goldin, the passage of time has only deepened the urgency. In a wide-ranging interview marking the grim milestone, she thanked President Donald Trump and his advisors for their efforts so far\u2014 and asked for them to ensure that no ceasefire, normalization deal or regional agreement moves forward without the return of her son.",
      "\"We are turning to and hoping that President Trump and his people \u2014 who understand this issue \u2014 will recognize that the real victory over Iran is to bring everyone home immediately and unconditionally. Hadar is a symbol, and the Saudis must make this demand on their side, because you can\u2019t speak of normalization while we remain in a state of abnormality.",
      "MARCO RUBIO HOLDS FIRST MEETING WITH FAMILIES OF HOSTAGES HELD BY HAMAS",
      "Hadar Goldin's body has been held captive by Hamas terrorists for 4,000 days. Goldin was killed by the terror group, who have held his body as a bargaining chip ever since. (Courtesy: Bring Them Home Now)",
      "\"These deals are a bluff \u2014 and this selective process is horrific. It\u2019s killing the families and the hostages. The further we go without bringing everyone back and ending this awful war, the more Hadar Goldins there will be. It\u2019s unbearable.\"",
      "Hadar Goldin was born to a prominent family of educators and raised on values of faith, service and compassion. Hadar was known for his gentle character, sharp intellect and deep artistic talent. He had just gotten engaged. In his free time, he drew portraits, wrote poetry and taught children with disabilities.",
      "He was serving in the elite Givati Brigade when, on Aug. 1, 2014, during Operation Protective Edge, Hamas violated a ceasefire \u2014 agreed upon hours earlier with U.S. and U.N. mediation \u2014 by launching a surprise attack. Hadar was killed and dragged into a tunnel inside Gaza.",
      "For his mother, that moment shattered not only her family\u2019s world, but also what she calls \"the Israeli military\u2019s sacred code.\"",
      "\"The IDF\u2019s ethos is never to leave a soldier behind,\" she said. \"But on August 28, 2014, Israel signed a ceasefire with Hamas without demanding Hadar\u2019s return. That broke something fundamental.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Leah Goldin has met with world leaders, lawmakers and military officials across the U.S. and Europe, seeking justice for her son and others like him. She points to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2474, passed in 2019, which obligates all parties to an armed conflict to return the remains of the dead as a humanitarian act and confidence-building measure.",
      "\"This is international law,\" she said. \"And yet Hadar is still in Gaza.\"",

      "Today, Goldin sees a rare opportunity \u2014 a convergence of diplomatic efforts with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Gaza \u2014 to demand Hadar\u2019s return before any agreements are finalized.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia has enormous leverage,\" she said. \"They\u2019re leading the Islamic world. If they want normalization with Israel, then let them demand the return of Hadar and all of the hostages as a gesture of goodwill.\"",
      "She also praised Steve Witkoff, a Trump envoy on both Iran and Saudi issues, and urged him to connect the dots. \"He\u2019s in charge of the deals. He knows the hostages matter. Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll finish the business and deal with the hostages later. That\u2019s immoral.\"",

      "Goldin says she has lost trust in the Israeli government, which she believes has repeatedly sidelined her son for political convenience. \"It\u2019s the same people for 11 years, just in different chairs,\" she said. \"They sign ceasefires, they release terrorists \u2014 but leave Hadar behind.\"",
      "Since Hamas\u2019 October 7 massacre, Leah and her family have taken on a new role: advising and supporting the families of current hostages through the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group they helped build in the days after the attack.",
      "\"My son Tzur, who also served in special forces, said no family should go through this alone,\" she said. \"So we organized \u2014 gave them our contacts, our tools, our lessons. But it\u2019s painful. Because we\u2019ve seen this before. And we know how easy it is to be forgotten.\"",
      "She calls the ongoing hostage negotiations \"a nightmare of selection,\" where some are prioritized and others left behind. \"As a daughter of Holocaust survivors, this feels like moral collapse,\" she said.",

      "TRUMP SAYS 'VERY CLOSE' TO SECURING ISRAEL, HAMAS CEASEFIRE, RETURNING HOSTAGES",
      "\"This is a complex political environment right in the middle of a ceasefire negotiation,\" Chairman for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) Rev. Johnnie Moore told Fox News Digital. \"I understand on the first night of the ceasefire negotiation, one of the primary issues that Hamas and their negotiators brought up was they wanted to see the elimination of the GHF.",
      "\"Which ought to tell you something,\" he continued. \"Hamas didn't want 70 million meals of food in the Gaza Strip for the people they allege they care about \u2013 this is absurd.\"",
      "Following Israel\u2019s near-three-month blockade on aid to the Gaza Strip, the GHF \u2013 a U.S. and Israeli-backed aid mechanism \u2013 was, in late May, permitted to initiate food delivery with the assistance of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) as a means to ensure food trucks were not overrun and ransacked by the Hamas terrorist group.",
      "The GHF, which has faced stiff backlash for its divergence from traditional humanitarian assistance methods, has argued that its convoys have been far better secured from Hamas attacks than United Nations\u2019 delivery trucks, and therefore ensured the aid has actually ended up in the hands of Palestinian civilians.",
      "Hamas has long used humanitarian assistance as a means of control over Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and as a tool for recruitment, going so far as to threaten starving civilians from accepting\u00a0GHF food aid for their families in late May, telling them they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\"",
      "The GHF has delivered some 70 million meals to between 800,000 and 1 million Palestinians, Moore confirmed.",

      "The U.N. did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about whether it was the IDF or Hamas that was on the firing end of the gun, and whether these deaths occurred as a direct result of civilians seeking aid, chaotic eruptions that ensued outside of distribution centers, or if these were deaths occurred amid the continued war as civilians were in the process of heading to distributions centers.",
      "The IDF earlier this month said that following an investigation into civilian casualties reported at aid distribution sites, it had issued new orders to its South Command based on \"lessons learned.\"",
      "The GHF this week announced a second phase in its aid delivery system that could lower the threats civilians face when seeking aid, by distributing supplies directly through community leaders across Gaza \u2013 meaning there could be less travel involved for civilians in need.",
      "But the GHF also fervently rejects the U.N. death toll figures and Moore maintains that no deaths have occurred on or near their distribution sites.",
      "\"The U.N. is lying. They're just lying. They're taking statistics that originate from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, and they're sharing those statistics without any scrutiny at all,\" Moore told Fox News Digital.",

We know that Hamas doesn't distinguish between the death of Hamas militants and between civilians, and\u2026we know that from the very beginning of the operation of GHF, Hamas made an intentional decision that the best way to see the end of GHF was to say that our sites were these death traps,\" he added.",
      "The U.N., on the other hand, maintains that it vets its own informants and obtains evidence through \"various reliable sources, including medical, human rights and humanitarian organizations.\"",

      "\"We want to work with these organizations, but instead of engaging with us, what they've been doing is they've been working behind the scenes to sabotage us,\" Moore said. \"There's no other way to describe it. The U.N. is behaving like a mafia.\"",
      "While the U.N. has not officially called for the removal of the GHF, it has criticized the organization\u2019s \"militarized\" approach to delivering aid, which is not viewed as acceptable by the Sphere Association, which sets the international standards for humanitarian aid.",
      "Both the GHF and the U.N. have said more aid is not only needed, but it would help eliminate the intense security risks affiliated with obtaining humanitarian supplies.",
      "\"I have been very clear that the U.N. cannot do humanitarian work alone in Gaza, we need partners,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News Digital. \"All that we ask is that these partners operate under the globally accepted humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.\"",
      "Though both sides ultimately have the same goal, there appears to be an increasing impasse over how to provide stable aid for Palestinians who continue to live in extremely dire situations.",
      "\"My mission, and the mission of GHF is really, really simple. It's just to feed people. And it should not be as controversial as it has been,\" Moore said. \"My interest has always been in the in the \u2018day after\u2019. We have to do both.\"",

      "Looking back at the tsunami of words but lack of definitive action from the previous administration, Hudson added, \"If you look at the facts on the ground in Sudan today, this might be the last moment we have to try to walk the country back from the brink of collapse. U.S. involvement now is essential, not just for regional stability but for ensuring the U.S.\u2019s own long-term security interests.",
      "\"A failed state of 50 million people on the shores of the Red Sea will disrupt an essential lane of commercial navigation, destabilize partners across the Gulf and send waves of migrants streaming into Europe and Africa. None of this serves Washington\u2019s interests.\"",

      "Hudson said the U.S. could \u2014 and should \u2014 end that support.",
      "\"The Trump administration is uniquely positioned to make a difference in Sudan,\" Hudson said. \"The principal backers to the sides in the war \u2014 Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Turkey \u2014 are all U.S. allies. where President Trump has cultivated close ties and deep influence. He is in a position to help these countries settle their differences and forge a consensus on ending their support for the war. It will take some dedicated diplomacy, but that is the message that he is trying to send, that he is a peacemaker.\"",
      "\"The United States remains focused on working with our partners to resolve the crisis in Sudan,\" the State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital Friday. \"We support the restoration of civilian governance in a peaceful, unified Sudan. We continue to engage with key regional and other partners to urge the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) to cease hostilities, allow unhindered humanitarian access to all parts of the country, protect civilians and take steps toward a negotiated peace through inclusive dialogue.\"",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/new-us-assessment-finds-american-strikes-destroyed-only-one-three-iran-rcna218761",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 09:00:43 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump rejected a military plan for more comprehensive strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that would have lasted weeks, NBC News has also learned.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 One of the three nuclear enrichment sites in Iran struck by the United States last month was mostly destroyed, setting work there back significantly. But the two others were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to, according to a recent U.S. assessment of the destruction caused by the military operation, five current and former U.S. officials familiar with the assessment told NBC News.",
      "The assessment, part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to determine the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program since the facilities were struck, was briefed to some U.S. lawmakers, Defense Department officials and allied countries in recent days, four of those people said.",
      "NBC News has also learned that U.S. Central Command had developed a much more comprehensive plan to strike Iran that would have involved hitting three additional sites in an operation that would have stretched for several weeks instead of a single night, according to a current U.S. official and two former U.S. officials.",
      "President Donald Trump was briefed on that plan, but it was rejected because it was at odds with his foreign policy instincts to extract the United States from conflicts abroad, not dig deeper into them, as well as the possibility of a high number of casualties on both sides, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said.",
      "\u201cWe were willing to go all the way in our options, but the president did not want to,\u201d one of the sources with knowledge of the plan said.",
      "In a speech in the hours after they took place, Trump called the strikes he directed \u201ca spectacular military success\u201d and said, \u201cIran\u2019s key enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\u201d",
      "The reality as gleaned through intelligence so far appears to be more nuanced. And if the early findings about the damage inflicted to Iran\u2019s nuclear program hold up as more intelligence comes in, the United States could find itself back in a conflict there.",
      "There have been discussions within both the American and Israeli governments about whether additional strikes on the two less-damaged facilities could be necessary if Iran does not soon agree to restart negotiations with the Trump administration on a nuclear deal or if there are signs Iran is trying to rebuild at those locations, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said. Iran has long said its nuclear program is purely for peaceful, civilian purposes.",
      "The recent assessment is a snapshot of the damage U.S. strikes inflicted amid an intelligence-gathering process that administration officials have said is expected to continue for months. Assessments of Iran\u2019s nuclear program after the U.S. strikes are expected to change over time, and according to two of the current officials, as the process progresses, the findings suggest more damage than previous assessments revealed. That assessment remains for now the current thinking on the impact of the strikes, officials said.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said and experts have verified, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities,\u201d White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement. \u201cAmerica and the world are safer, thanks to his decisive action.\u201d",
      "In a statement of his own, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said: \u201cThe credibility of the Fake News Media is similar to that of the current state of the Iranian nuclear facilities: destroyed, in the dirt, and will take years to recover. President Trump was clear and the American people understand: Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were completely and totally obliterated. There is no doubt about that.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cOperation Midnight Hammer was a significant blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities thanks to the decisive action of President Trump and the bravery of every man and woman in uniform who supported this mission.\u201d",
      "Destruction and deterrence",
      "The U.S. strikes targeted three enrichment sites in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. U.S. officials believe the attack on Fordo, which has long been viewed as a critical component of Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, was successful in setting back Iranian enrichment capabilities at that site by as much as two years, according to two of the current officials.",
      "Much of the administration\u2019s public messaging about the strikes has focused on Fordo. In a Pentagon briefing they held in response to reporting on an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that concluded that Iran\u2019s nuclear program had been set back by only three to six months, for instance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talked extensively about the strike at Fordo but not the strikes at Natanz and Isfahan.",
      "U.S. officials knew before the airstrikes that Iran had structures and enriched uranium at Natanz and Isfahan that were likely to be beyond the reach of even America\u2019s 30,000-pound GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs, three of the sources said. Those bombs, which had never been used in combat before the strikes, were designed with the deeply buried facilities carved into the side of a mountain at Fordo in mind.",
      "As early as 2023, though, there were indications that Iran was digging tunnels at Natanz that were below where the GBU-57 could reach. There are also tunnels deep underground at Isfahan. The United States hit surface targets at Isfahan with Tomahawk missiles and did not drop GBU-57s there, but it did use them at Natanz.",
      "White House officials pointed NBC News to a closed-door briefing conducted in late June by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who told lawmakers that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and that several key nuclear facilities were \u201ccompletely destroyed,\u201d according to an administration official\u2019s description of the briefing. Ratcliffe said the only metal conversion facility at Natanz, required for nuclear enrichment, was destroyed to the point that it would take \u201cyears to rebuild,\u201d according to a White House official who was authorized to describe some contents of the classified briefing.",
      "Ratcliffe also said that the intelligence community believes the strikes buried the vast majority of enriched uranium at Isfahan and Fordo and that thus it would be extremely difficult for the Iranians to extract it to resume enrichment, according to the official. The United States has not seen indications that Iran is trying to dig out the facilities, two officials said.",
      "As NBC News has reported, the Israeli government believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium remains intact but buried beneath the Isfahan facility, according to a senior Israeli government official who briefed reporters in Washington last week. The official said, however, that Israel considers the material effectively unreachable, because it is watching and will conduct new strikes if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the uranium. The official also said Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been set back by up to two years.",
      "Similarly, even if the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were not completely destroyed, U.S. officials and Republican advocates of the operation believe it was a success because it has changed the strategic equation for Iran. From their point of view, the regime in Tehran now faces a credible threat of more airstrikes if Israel and the United States believe it is trying to revive clandestine nuclear work.",
      "Asked late last month whether he would consider bombing Iran again if intelligence reports concluded Iran can enrich uranium at a level that concerns him, Trump said: \u201cSure. Without question. Absolutely.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s air defenses have been largely destroyed, making it all but impossible for Iran to defend against further strikes on facilities in the future, the White House official said.",
      "\u201cIt was made clear that Iran no longer has any more [air defenses], so the idea that they can easily rebuild anything is ludicrous,\u201d the White House official said.",
      "The \u2018all-in\u2019 plan",
      "Beginning during the Biden administration, as early as last fall and into this spring, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, had developed a plan to go \u201call-in\u201d on striking Iran, according to a current U.S. official and two former officials. That option was designed to \u201ctruly decimate\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, in the words of one of the former officials.",
      "Under the plan, the United States would have hit six sites. The thinking was that the six sites would have to be hit repeatedly to inflict the kind of damage necessary to completely end the program, people familiar with the thinking said. The plan would also have involved targeting more of Iran\u2019s air defense and ballistic missile capabilities, and planners projected it could result in a high number of Iranian casualties. U.S. officials expected that if that were to take place, Iran would target American positions, for example in Iraq and Syria, a person familiar with the plan said.",
      "\u201cIt would be a protracted air campaign,\u201d the person said.",
      "Some Trump administration officials believed a deeper offensive option against Iran was a viable policy, two of the former officials said.",
      "Trump was briefed on the so-called all-in plan, but it was rejected ultimately because it would have required a sustained period of conflict.",
      "The history",
      "During his first term, in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that was negotiated during the Obama administration. The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, imposed strict limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions.",
      "Under the deal, Iran was a year away from obtaining enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. After Trump withdrew from the accord and reimposed sanctions, Iran flouted restrictions on its uranium enrichment. Before the June airstrikes, the regime had enough fissile material for about nine to 10 bombs, according to U.S. officials and United Nations inspectors.",
      "Trump has since sought a new agreement with Iran that would block it from developing nuclear weapons. Indirect talks between U.S. and Iranian officials failed to clinch a deal before Israel launched airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "Iran has long denied that it wants to build a nuclear weapon, a position its foreign minister reiterated in an interview with NBC News the day before the U.S. strikes."

He\u2019s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn\u2019t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy.",

      "A recent assessment of the destruction caused by the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites last month determined that one enrichment site was mostly destroyed, but two others were not as badly damaged.",
      "The sites have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to, five current and former U.S. officials familiar with the assessment said. The assessment was briefed to some U.S. lawmakers, Defense Department officials and allied countries in recent days, four of the sources said.",
      "A current U.S. official and two former U.S. officials also told NBC News that U.S. Central Command had developed a much more comprehensive plan to strike Iran. It would have involved hitting three additional sites in an operation that would have stretched several weeks instead of a single night.

      "The U.S. strikes in June targeted three enrichment sites in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Much of the Trump administration's public messaging about the strikes has focused on Fordo, which has long been viewed as a critical component of Iran's nuclear ambitions.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 One of the three nuclear enrichment sites in Iran struck by the United States last month was mostly destroyed, setting work there back significantly. But the two others were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to, according to a recent U.S. assessment of the destruction caused by the military operation, five current and former U.S. officials familiar with the assessment told NBC News.",
      "The assessment, part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to determine the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program since the facilities were struck, was briefed to some U.S. lawmakers, Defense Department officials and allied countries in recent days, four of those people said.",
      "NBC News has also learned that U.S. Central Command had developed a much more comprehensive plan to strike Iran that would have involved hitting three additional sites in an operation that would have stretched for several weeks instead of a single night, according to a current U.S. official and two former U.S. officials.",
      "President Donald Trump was briefed on that plan, but it was rejected because it was at odds with his foreign policy instincts to extract the United States from conflicts abroad, not dig deeper into them, as well as the possibility of a high number of casualties on both sides, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said.",
      "\u201cWe were willing to go all the way in our options, but the president did not want to,\u201d one of the sources with knowledge of the plan said.",
      "In a speech in the hours after they took place, Trump called the strikes he directed \u201ca spectacular military success\u201d and said, \u201cIran\u2019s key enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\u201d",
      "The reality as gleaned through intelligence so far appears to be more nuanced. And if the early findings about the damage inflicted to Iran\u2019s nuclear program hold up as more intelligence comes in, the United States could find itself back in a conflict there.",
      "There have been discussions within both the American and Israeli governments about whether additional strikes on the two less-damaged facilities could be necessary if Iran does not soon agree to restart negotiations with the Trump administration on a nuclear deal or if there are signs Iran is trying to rebuild at those locations, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said. Iran has long said its nuclear program is purely for peaceful, civilian purposes.",
      "The recent assessment is a snapshot of the damage U.S. strikes inflicted amid an intelligence-gathering process that administration officials have said is expected to continue for months. Assessments of Iran\u2019s nuclear program after the U.S. strikes are expected to change over time, and according to two of the current officials, as the process progresses, the findings suggest more damage than previous assessments revealed. That assessment remains for now the current thinking on the impact of the strikes, officials said.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said and experts have verified, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities,\u201d White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement. \u201cAmerica and the world are safer, thanks to his decisive action.\u201d",
      "In a statement of his own, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said: \u201cThe credibility of the Fake News Media is similar to that of the current state of the Iranian nuclear facilities: destroyed, in the dirt, and will take years to recover. President Trump was clear and the American people understand: Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were completely and totally obliterated. There is no doubt about that.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cOperation Midnight Hammer was a significant blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities thanks to the decisive action of President Trump and the bravery of every man and woman in uniform who supported this mission.\u201d",
      "Destruction and deterrence",
      "The U.S. strikes targeted three enrichment sites in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. U.S. officials believe the attack on Fordo, which has long been viewed as a critical component of Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, was successful in setting back Iranian enrichment capabilities at that site by as much as two years, according to two of the current officials.",
      "Much of the administration\u2019s public messaging about the strikes has focused on Fordo. In a Pentagon briefing they held in response to reporting on an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that concluded that Iran\u2019s nuclear program had been set back by only three to six months, for instance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talked extensively about the strike at Fordo but not the strikes at Natanz and Isfahan.",
      "U.S. officials knew before the airstrikes that Iran had structures and enriched uranium at Natanz and Isfahan that were likely to be beyond the reach of even America\u2019s 30,000-pound GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs, three of the sources said. Those bombs, which had never been used in combat before the strikes, were designed with the deeply buried facilities carved into the side of a mountain at Fordo in mind.",
      "As early as 2023, though, there were indications that Iran was digging tunnels at Natanz that were below where the GBU-57 could reach. There are also tunnels deep underground at Isfahan. The United States hit surface targets at Isfahan with Tomahawk missiles and did not drop GBU-57s there, but it did use them at Natanz.",
      "White House officials pointed NBC News to a closed-door briefing conducted in late June by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who told lawmakers that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and that several key nuclear facilities were \u201ccompletely destroyed,\u201d according to an administration official\u2019s description of the briefing. Ratcliffe said the only metal conversion facility at Natanz, required for nuclear enrichment, was destroyed to the point that it would take \u201cyears to rebuild,\u201d according to a White House official who was authorized to describe some contents of the classified briefing.",
      "Ratcliffe also said that the intelligence community believes the strikes buried the vast majority of enriched uranium at Isfahan and Fordo and that thus it would be extremely difficult for the Iranians to extract it to resume enrichment, according to the official. The United States has not seen indications that Iran is trying to dig out the facilities, two officials said.",
      "As NBC News has reported, the Israeli government believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium remains intact but buried beneath the Isfahan facility, according to a senior Israeli government official who briefed reporters in Washington last week. The official said, however, that Israel considers the material effectively unreachable, because it is watching and will conduct new strikes if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the uranium. The official also said Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been set back by up to two years.",
      "Similarly, even if the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were not completely destroyed, U.S. officials and Republican advocates of the operation believe it was a success because it has changed the strategic equation for Iran. From their point of view, the regime in Tehran now faces a credible threat of more airstrikes if Israel and the United States believe it is trying to revive clandestine nuclear work.",
      "Asked late last month whether he would consider bombing Iran again if intelligence reports concluded Iran can enrich uranium at a level that concerns him, Trump said: \u201cSure. Without question. Absolutely.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s air defenses have been largely destroyed, making it all but impossible for Iran to defend against further strikes on facilities in the future, the White House official said.",
      "\u201cIt was made clear that Iran no longer has any more [air defenses], so the idea that they can easily rebuild anything is ludicrous,\u201d the White House official said.",
      "The \u2018all-in\u2019 plan",
      "Beginning during the Biden administration, as early as last fall and into this spring, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, had developed a plan to go \u201call-in\u201d on striking Iran, according to a current U.S. official and two former officials. That option was designed to \u201ctruly decimate\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, in the words of one of the former officials.",
      "Under the plan, the United States would have hit six sites. The thinking was that the six sites would have to be hit repeatedly to inflict the kind of damage necessary to completely end the program, people familiar with the thinking said. The plan would also have involved targeting more of Iran\u2019s air defense and ballistic missile capabilities, and planners projected it could result in a high number of Iranian casualties. U.S. officials expected that if that were to take place, Iran would target American positions, for example in Iraq and Syria, a person familiar with the plan said.",
      "\u201cIt would be a protracted air campaign,\u201d the person said.",
      "Some Trump administration officials believed a deeper offensive option against Iran was a viable policy, two of the former officials said.",
      "Trump was briefed on the so-called all-in plan, but it was rejected ultimately because it would have required a sustained period of conflict.",
      "The history",
      "During his first term, in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that was negotiated during the Obama administration. The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, imposed strict limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions.",
      "Under the deal, Iran was a year away from obtaining enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. After Trump withdrew from the accord and reimposed sanctions, Iran flouted restrictions on its uranium enrichment. Before the June airstrikes, the regime had enough fissile material for about nine to 10 bombs, according to U.S. officials and United Nations inspectors.",
      "Trump has since sought a new agreement with Iran that would block it from developing nuclear weapons. Indirect talks between U.S. and Iranian officials failed to clinch a deal before Israel launched airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "Iran has long denied that it wants to build a nuclear weapon, a position its foreign minister reiterated in an interview with NBC News the day before the U.S. strikes."

He\u2019s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn\u2019t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy.",
      "\u201cIt just makes me so mad that this is happening,\u201d said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cIt\u2019s scary because my son is not protected, and I\u2019m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband\u2019s job.\u201d In these situations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends quarantine for 28 days.",
      "Because he\u2019s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.",
      "At this point, Martin said, \u201cit\u2019s just a waiting game.\u201d",
      "Her family\u2019s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the number of measles cases has surpassed a level not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.",
      "On Wednesday, the CDC reported 1,309 cases of measles in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.",
      "Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.",
      "Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent measles outbreak in West Texas.",
      "\"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to,\" Montanez said. \"Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three.\"",
      "Cedar Rapids isn\u2019t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just seven cases have been confirmed across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.",
      "Still, the Martin family\u2019s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,\u201d said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. \u201cIt just takes one\u201d measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact.",
      "On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Chinese authorities in Hong Kong have launched a criminal investigation after more than a dozen female students and teachers at the University of Hong Kong accused a male law student of using AI to generate deepfake porn images of them.",
      "The probe, announced Tuesday by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, came after an outcry from students at the university, the city's oldest, who said it hadn't done enough to protect them or punish the accused.",
      "\"The images were organized into folders named after the victims, totaling 700+ images (including the original photos),\" read a widely circulated letter that was posted Saturday on Instagram from an account run by three unnamed victims.",
      "The accused, referred to in the letter only as \u201ca male law student,\u201d took photos of the victims from social media and used AI software to generate pornographic images with their faces, according to the letter. The images were discovered on his laptop reported to the university in February. They were not known to have been widely distributed.",
      "In March, the university interviewed some of the victims, and in April informed one of them that the accused student had written a 60-word \"apology letter.\"",
      "While NBC News was unable to confirm the authenticity of that letter, and the account did not respond to a request for comment, the university said it was \"aware of the social media posts concerning a student allegedly using AI tools to create indecent images.\"",
      "\u201cThe University has already issued him a warning letter and demanded him a formal apology to his affected peers,\u201d the university said Saturday in a statement.",
      "Deepfake porn is a type of nonconsensual pornography that involves altering existing images or creating entirely new ones using readily available AI tools to make it appear that a person has participated in sexual acts.",
      "Regulations in Hong Kong around the technology are currently sparse. While it criminalizes \u201cpublication or threatened publication of intimate images without consent,\u201d it does not explicitly outlaw their generation.",
      "In the U.S., regulations govern dissemination, with President Donald Trump signing legislation in May that bans nonconsensual online publication of AI-generated porn, but federal law does not explicitly prohibit personal possession, and a district judge ruled in February that possessing such images was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "After it was rocked by a number of scandals similar to the one playing out in Hong Kong, South Korea passed a law last year that criminalizes not only the possession but also the consumption of such content.",
      "Though the University of Hong Kong said that it had undertaken various steps on behalf of the victims, \u201cincluding class adjustments,\u201d the victims wrote in the letter that the university\u2019s inaction had resulted in them being forced to share the classroom with the suspect \u201cat least four times, causing unnecessary psychological distress.\u201d",
      "Outrage has since grown in the wider student community, which has demanded more stringent action. That prompted a response from the city\u2019s top official, Chief Executive John Lee, who said at a news briefing Tuesday that universities have the \u201cresponsibility of developing students\u2019 moral character,\u201d adding institutions should \u201cdeal with student misconduct seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny conduct that causes harm to others may constitute a criminal offense and may also infringe individual rights and also privacy,\u201d he said.",
      "The university did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but it told the South China Morning Post this week that it was conducting a review of the incident and vowed further action if victims demanded more.",
      "\u201cThe university is now further reviewing the case and will take further actions when appropriate to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment,\u201d it said."

      "How to shop for ampoules",

      "Yoo suggests keeping an eye out for a strong concentration of a main ingredient. While the concentrations differ between products, some can go as high as 50% for a single ingredient, which usually yields quick results if you use them properly, says Yoo. They should also have simple formulas that have a short ingredient list and minimal additives, like colorants, preservatives or fragrance, to help prevent irritation.",
      "As with any skin care treatment, your purchase should be tailored to addressing your specific skin issues, like breakouts, dullness and dryness. If you have sensitive skin and are looking to try ampoules with stronger ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or retinol, choose a formula that has calming ingredients like ceramides or centella to help offset any irritation, says Yoo.",
      "Here are some ingredients to consider based on skin concerns and skin type:",
      "Sensitive, irritated skin: Look for soothing ingredients like aloe vera, chamomile and centella asiatica.Dry, dehydrated skin: Look for hydrators like ceramides, glycerin or hyaluronic acid.Dull skin or skin with hyperpigmentation: Consider brightening actives like niacinamide, vitamin C and plant extracts.Mature skin with fine lines: Consider firming ingredients like retinol and peptides.",

      "Ampoules are like a booster shot for your skin, so you should use them during periods of skin stress or flare-ups, says Yoo. \u201cIt\u2019s a booster step in your routine, not an everyday essential,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be helpful when your regular products aren\u2019t doing enough and you need something more intensive.\u201d She recommends cycling them into your routine after cleansing and before moisturizing, especially at night. However, while some ampoules are gentle enough to use daily, many are also strong formulas that are meant for short-term use, so be sure to check the label for best usage instructions, says Yoo.",
      "The difference between ampoules and serums are in their concentration, and which you should use depends on your skin goals, according to Yoo. Ampoules have a higher concentration of actives and often focus on one key ingredient, while serums are better for daily maintenance and usually combine multiple ingredients.",
      "\u201cAmpoules are more like short-term treatments,\u201d she says. Ampoules also tend to work faster than serums, but Yoo warns they can be more intense for sensitive skin.",

      "The fundraising reports highlight candidates who are starting to prepare for competitive races and others who may be lagging. The most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission cover money raised and spent from April through June.",
      "Here are five takeaways from the latest reports:",
      "Cornyn and Ernst stay in the spotlight",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, has been facing questions over whether he will be able to overcome a challenge from his right flank by state GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton. And while the new reports show Cornyn\u2019s entire political operation brought in a significant haul, the report won\u2019t necessarily quiet concerns about his ability to push back a challenger.",
      "Comparing direct fundraising into the two candidates\u2019 official campaigns, Paxton outraised Cornyn $2.9 million to $804,000. It was the second-lowest quarterly haul from Cornyn\u2019s campaign across 2013-14, 2019-20 and the current election cycle \u2014 the recent times Cornyn has been preparing to defend his seat.",
      "Cornyn also raised funds into another group supporting his campaign: a joint fundraising committee that brought in $3.1 million. Much of that money can be used in support of his campaign, but not all can be directly transferred to it. Cornyn closed June with $5.9 million in his campaign account, compared with Paxton\u2019s $2.5 million.",
      "GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa took in a notable haul, too. She hasn\u2019t officially announced she\u2019s running for another term, though she did bring on a campaign manager. Still, there has been speculation about whether she could decide to retire. She raised $722,000 last quarter \u2014 less than in any quarter during her 2020 bid.",
      "Two of Ernst\u2019s possible Democratic opponents raised money just below her total haul for the quarter. She still holds a significant cash-on-hand advantage over her possible Democratic opponents, with $3.4 million in her account.",
      "\"Instead of fundraising trips and meeting with millionaires, Senator Ernst has been hard at work advancing President Trump's agenda and delivering a tax break for hardworking Iowans,\" Ernst\u2019s campaign manager, Brian Kraber, told NBC News in a statement. \"With over $3.4 million cash on hand and the strong support of Iowans in every corner of the state, Joni isn't slowing down anytime soon.\"",
      "The most vulnerable Senate incumbents amass war chests",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine are the two most vulnerable senators on the map next year. And they spent last month raising money like it.",
      "Ossoff, the only Democratic senator running for re-election in a state President Donald Trump carried last year, continues to print money, following up an $11.2 million first fundraising quarter with a $10 million second quarter, ending June with a whopping $15.5 million on hand. While the GOP primary race to take him on next fall is still materializing, only Rep. Buddy Carter raised a seven-figure sum, $3 million, after a $2 million loan from the candidate.",
      "Collins, the only Republican senator defending a seat in a state former Vice President Kamala Harris won last year, posted a strong fundraising haul for her much smaller state: $2.4 million. Her top Democratic opponent so far, former congressional aide Jordan Wood, raised $1.6 million, which included a $250,000 candidate loan.",
      "Collins has more than six times the cash on hand Wood has.",
      "Battleground Senate primaries take shape",
      "The latest fundraising reports also shed light on hotly contested primaries in key Senate battlegrounds.",
      "Democratic Sen. Gary Peters\u2019 decision not to run for re-election in Michigan has led to a contested Democratic primary, with Rep. Haley Stevens leading the primary field with $2.8 million, though that included a $1.5 million transfer from her House campaign. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow raised $2.1 million, former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed raised $1.8 million, and former state House Speaker Joe Tate raised $192,000.",
      "Stevens ended the quarter with more cash on hand than her primary opponents, banking nearly $2 million.",
      "GOP former Rep. Mike Rogers\u2019 campaign raised $745,000 and ended the quarter with $1.1 million on hand. The Rogers campaign also touted $779,000 raised by his joint fundraising committee, which is tied to the campaign; the National Republican Senatorial Committee; another Rogers PAC; and a super PAC. The joint fundraising committee ended the quarter with $770,000 on hand.",
      "Rogers, who is running for the Senate again after he lost a close race last year, could face a primary despite having endorsements from the NRSC and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. Rep. Bill Huizenga has also been weighing a Senate run, and his campaign raised $747,000 in the second quarter.",
      "A Democratic primary is also underway in Minnesota, a potentially competitive state where Democratic Sen. Tina Smith is retiring.",
      "Rep. Angie Craig outraised Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan by pulling in nearly $2.5 million, including more than $600,000 from her House campaign, and ended the quarter with $1.8 million on hand. Flanagan raised $917,000 and banked $783,000.",
      "Royce White, the only Republican in the race so far, raised just $125,000.",
      "Republicans have a contested primary to take on Ossoff in Georgia, where Carter led the GOP field in fundraising thanks in part to his sizable loan. Insurance Commissioner John King raised $518,000 and ended the quarter with $450,000 on hand.",
      "Millions pour into safe-seat primaries",
      "Then there are the handful of Senate primaries that will most likely decide who heads to Washington in 2027 because the states overwhelmingly support Republicans or Democrats.",
      "The most consequential may be Louisiana, where Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy\u2019s political career is on the line amid a challenge from the conservative wing of his party. He raised $1.6 million and closed June with $8.7 million banked. His main primary opponent, state Treasurer John Fleming, lent himself $2 million and raised $115,000 more from individuals. State Sen.

      "GOP Rep. Andy Barr flexed his fundraising muscles in Kentucky last quarter, raising $1.4 million and ending with more than $6 million banked away. State Attorney General Daniel Cameron raised under $400,000 with about $500,000 in cash on hand, while businessman Nate Morris, who is also running, announced his campaign after the books closed.",
      "The Democratic race to replace Durbin is shaping up to be expensive, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi's Senate campaign committee reporting a $12.7 million haul (including $10 million in transfers from his flush House campaign, which still has millions more dollars in reserve). Krishnamoorthi has also already hit the airwaves, launching a TV ad this week. Rep. Robin Kelly raised nearly $2.5 million (mostly a transfer from her House campaign), and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton raised nearly $1.1 million.",
      "House lawmakers prepare for fights ahead",
      "The battle for the House also continues to take shape, with Democrats looking to net three seats to take control of the chamber. And lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are filling their campaign coffers ahead of tough races.",

Roberson lent his campaign $2 million, and O\u2019Donnell lent his $3 million.",
      "Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who faces a federal indictment, had the opposite dynamic. His $460,000 quarter outpaced his opponents\u2019, but that\u2019s only because he lent his campaign $200,000."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has a Texas-sized conundrum on his hands as Republicans prepare for a Senate primary in the state, with GOP Sen. John Cornyn making his case for the White House to get involved as he tries to fend off a challenge from state Attorney General Ken Paxton.",
      "But, so far, Trump is staying on the sidelines.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve talked to him about it a number of times. He is not ready to make that endorsement,\u201d Cornyn told NBC News on Tuesday. \u201cI think as we start advertising and closing the gap in the polls, hopefully he\u2019ll see fit to make that endorsement, but we can\u2019t wait.\u201d",
      "\u201cI pointed out to him, and he knows this, that if he endorsed me, the race would be over,\u201d Cornyn later added.",
      "But Cornyn is struggling in recent primary polling, as Paxton has pitched himself as the true exemplar of the party\u2019s MAGA wing. Some Republicans are concerned that Paxton \u2014 a conservative firebrand with no shortage of personal controversies, including some that led to an impeachment push by a number of fellow Republicans in 2023 \u2014 could be a problematic general election candidate who would force national Republicans to spend millions to defend the longtime red seat.",
      "Those concerns won\u2019t let up with the latest round of fundraising figures, released Tuesday night. Paxton lapped the senator in direct fundraising to their campaigns, though Cornyn\u2019s entire political operation raised a significant sum.",
      "The race came up at a White House meeting last week between Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, staffers with the Thune-aligned super PAC Senate Leadership Fund, and other former Trump campaign staffers. A source with knowledge of the meeting said the group agreed that Cornyn and allies need to focus over the summer on improving the incumbent\u2019s poll numbers. Thune told NBC News that the meeting \u201ccovered a whole range of races around the country\u201d but declined to go into detail.",
      "Paxton\u2019s team has also been in touch with the White House political team and sharing polling data, according to a source close to his campaign.",
      "In public surveys, the University of Texas at Tyler found Paxton leading Cornyn by 10 percentage points, 44%-34%, while Texas Southern University found Paxton leading by nine, 43%-34%. Both polls found about a quarter of voters undecided. Other private polls by outside groups with skin in the game have shown Paxton with an even larger lead.",
      "This is far from the first time Cornyn, a 40-year veteran of elected politics in the state, has faced issues on his right flank. His most recent challenge came in 2014, when he won 59% of the GOP primary vote.",
      "But it may be the most dangerous moment of his Senate career. Cornyn finds himself not only in a national party remade by Trump but in the middle of a civil war in his state between the establishment and the conservative forces that fueled the rise of Sen. Ted Cruz and other tea party Republicans, led to turmoil in the state Legislature and contributed to the impeachment push against and subsequent acquittal of Paxton.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the day and age of: The Republican Party is Trump\u2019s party. And Paxton has done a very good job of being very out-front, being very vocal, being a strong defender of Trump, which voters \u2014 that\u2019s the lens that they look through and evaluate candidates by,\u201d said Matt Langston, a Republican strategist in the state who is not involved in the race.",
      "Primary picks up",
      "Paxton was quick to question Cornyn\u2019s Trump connections and his conservative chops when he launched his primary campaign.",
      "In 2023, Cornyn responded to allegations that Trump had mishandled classified documents by telling a local news reporter that \u201che\u2019s created a circumstance for himself which is, I think, very serious.\u201d That same year, Cornyn responded to the civil verdict finding Trump liable for sexual abuse by saying, \u201cI do not think he could win the presidency\u201d because \u201celectability is \u2026 the sole criterion.\u201d",
      "Cornyn\u2019s opponents have also criticized his past votes on some gun control and immigration bills.",
      "It\u2019s why Cornyn has spent the months portraying himself as a staunch supporter of Trump. In March, he posted a photo of him reading Trump\u2019s book on social media. His pinned image on X is a photo of him with Trump. And his campaign regularly touts his record of voting for Trump\u2019s priorities in the Senate. Cornyn co-chaired a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month delving into questions about Joe Biden\u2019s fitness as president.",
      "\u201cI think we need to remind people of my support for President Trump and his agenda, which is about a 99.2% voting record with his first term and now in his second term,\u201d Cornyn told NBC News, referring to a memo from his Senate office that detailed more than 600 of Cornyn\u2019s votes since 2017. That memo also touted Cornyn\u2019s work to support Trump\u2019s Supreme Court and other judicial nominees, the 2017 tax cuts and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.",
      "On Wednesday, a pro-Cornyn super PAC, Texans for a Conservative Majority, launched a television ad campaign across the state, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact.",
      "\u201cMeet the man who votes with President Trump over 99% of the time,\u201d a narrator says in the group\u2019s first TV ad, which also features footage of Trump praising Cornyn at a rally.",
      "Chris LaCivita, a former top Trump campaign official, is working with the super PAC as its senior adviser, according to three people familiar with Cornyn\u2019s campaign. Tony Fabrizio, a top Trump pollster, is working directly with Cornyn\u2019s campaign.",
      "Paxton\u2019s vulnerabilities",
      "While Paxton has been trying to lob bombs at Cornyn from his right flank, Cornyn and his team are ready to exploit the attorney general\u2019s multiple controversies.",
      "\u201cThe baggage that my opponent would bring into the election would make it likely that we would lose that seat to a Democrat if he were the nominee. So I\u2019m not going to let that happen,\u201d Cornyn said.",
      "Paxton was indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015 and eventually reached a deal to avoid a trial. But related allegations \u2014 plus accusations including bribery and misuse of his office \u2014 led the GOP-controlled state House to impeach him in 2023, though the state Senate acquitted him.",
      "Prosecuting Paxton on ethical grounds will be a centerpiece of Cornyn\u2019s campaign. He blasted Paxton\u2019s bid as a \u201ccon man\u2019s vanity project\u201d and launched a \u201cCrooked Ken\u201d website detailing the impeachment and allegations of adultery that stemmed from that investigation.",
      "Paxton\u2019s pending divorce from wife, state Sen. Angela Paxton, brought those allegations back into the spotlight. Angela Paxton posted on X last week that she had \u201cfiled for divorce on biblical grounds \u2026 in light of recent discoveries.\u201d",
      "The day of Paxton\u2019s divorce announcement was his campaign\u2019s second-largest small-dollar fundraising day since his launch, according to a person close to the Paxton campaign.",
      "Paxton\u2019s allies see those controversies as fueling his reputation as a fighter among grassroots Republicans.",
      "\u201cKen has a strong 40, 45% of MAGA voters that won\u2019t leave him,\u201d said Paxton adviser Nick Maddux. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen him fight, they\u2019ve seen him in the trials and they like what he\u2019s done. And Cornyn\u2019s never done that. He doesn\u2019t have a hard base of support.\u201d",
      "Paxton\u2019s campaign also raised $2.9 million from April through June, ending the quarter with $2.5 million in its campaign account. Cornyn\u2019s campaign raised $804,000 and ended the quarter with $5.9 million on hand, while his joint fundraising committee raised $3.1 million and had $2.7 million on hand.",
      "The Cornyn campaign\u2019s haul marked its second-worst quarter over the senator\u2019s past two election cycles on the ballot (2020 and 2014). But the campaign dismissed any concerns about his fundraising.",
      "\u201cSenator Cornyn is a very strong fundraiser, always has been and will continue to be,\u201d said Cornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiack, who said focusing on the joint fundraising committee was a \u201cstrategic\u201d move to be able to access lower television ad rates.",
      "A growing field?",
      "While Cornyn and Paxton battle, it is possible the primary field could grow.",
      "U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt told NBC News late last month he still hasn\u2019t made a decision about whether to run for Senate, but the two-term Republican notes he hasn\u2019t seen a poll showing Cornyn can beat Paxton in a primary.",
      "Asked if that\u2019s a concern in Texas, he told NBC News: \u201cIt should be.\u201d",
      "Hunt\u2019s House campaign committee recently launched a cable ad buy that reaches beyond his Houston-area district, into the Dallas and San Antonio media markets, according AdImpact. Hunt also shared a minute-long spot that features Trump praising him, and a pro-Hunt outside group, Standing for Texas, has also spent more than $2 million so far on ads boosting him around the state.",
      "GOP Rep. Ronny Jackson also told NBC News this week that he has not ruled out running for Senate and he is going to \u201ckeep my powder dry right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of people think Ken Paxton might have trouble in the general,\u201d Jackson said, noting there are concerns among Republicans that a competitive Texas race would pull resources from other battleground states.",
      "That concern is partly why Senate Republican leaders, including Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott, are backing Cornyn.",
      "\u201cWe need an electable candidate that can win not just a primary, but a general, and we believe there\u2019s a path there for Cornyn to win both,\u201d Thune recently told NBC News.",
      "Democrats have long sought to turn Texas blue, but they have not been able to build on a narrow loss to Cruz in 2018. Trump won Texas by 8 percentage points last year, while Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by nearly 9 points. Allred recently launched another run for Senate.",
      "Langston, the GOP strategist, didn\u2019t buy the argument that Paxton would put the seat at risk if he is the nominee, given the state\u2019s red hue.",
      "\u201cYou would have to have almost 100% of registered Democrats coming out to vote, plus a good 10 or 12% of Republicans crossing over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just never going to happen.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WEST PITTSTON, Pa. \u2014 Vice President JD Vance gave an early glimpse Wednesday of the argument Republicans will make ahead of the 2026 midterm elections while touting the megabill the White House pushed through Congress.",
      "In a 20-minute speech in northeast Pennsylvania, Vance urged the audience to become fellow evangelists for what he called the \"big, beautiful bill\" in conversations with family and friends.",
      "Vance supplied the talking points he wants them to use, describing how workers at the machine shop that hosted his appearance will no longer pay taxes on overtime pay.",
      "Vance was silent about less popular facets of what had been a nearly 900-page bill. He did not mention, for example, steep cuts to Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income people. A report published Wednesday in JAMA Health Forum found that the cuts could lead to 1,000 more deaths a year.",
      "And while Vance said President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are getting \u201cWashington spending under control,\u201d the nation\u2019s debt will increase by $3.3 trillion over the next decade under the legislation, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Vance invited the audience to do its own research but asked it to \u201ctake what I said and ... go talk to your neighbors, go and talk to your friends about what this bill does for American citizens.\u201d",
      "Without explicitly mentioning the midterm elections that will determine control of Congress, Vance said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want to wake up in a year and a half and give the Democrats power back.\u201d",
      "Both parties are in the opening phase of a battle to shape voter impressions of the new law ahead of the midterms.",
      "Trump\u2019s Cabinet members are expected to travel the country in the coming months to help sell the bill to voters. Introducing Vance was Kelly Loeffler, administrator of the Small Business Administration. She used her speech to promote the law, calling it \u201crocket fuel for small business.\u201d",
      "Republicans face some headwinds in selling the legislation. A recent Economist/YouGov survey taken after Trump signed the bill on July 4 found that 35% of adults supported it, compared with 53% who were opposed.",
      "The White House needs GOP voters to be enthusiastic  about the law and motivated to vote next year if the party hopes to hang on to its majorities in the House and the Senate.",
      "\u201cThe Trump voters are happy and complacent right now,\u201d said John McLaughlin, a Trump pollster. \u201cAnd we have to get them fired up for next year. We have a lot of work to do. If President Trump is not on the ballot, it\u2019s harder to get them out.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s appearance was also an investment of sorts in his own political future. Pennsylvania is a perennial battleground state. Trump lost it in 2020 when he lost to Joe Biden but won it back last year when he was elected to a new term. Vance is a likely GOP candidate in the next presidential race \u2014 a prospect that voters interviewed before his speech said they welcome.",
      "Dwayne McDavitt, 63, of the group Bikers for Trump, said: \u201cI love JD Vance. I hope he runs in 2028. He\u2019s a very intelligent man.\u201d",
      "Vance said nothing about the ongoing furor that threatens to divide Trump voters: The Justice Department's finding that the Jeffrey Epstein files include no \u201cincriminating 'client list'\u201d or evidence that would implicate third parties.",
      "Many hard-core Trump have balked at the claim, while Trump has called upon them to drop the subject and stop talking about Epstein.",
      "Before Vance\u2019s appearance, supporters waiting in line offered mixed views of whether they believe the Trump administration is suppressing damning information involving Epstein.",
      "Steven Taylor, a truck driver living across the street from the machine shop, said he was \u201cangered\u201d when Trump said people should move on from the Epstein controversy.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re being lied to,\u201d said Taylor, 52. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t appreciate it. This is supposed to be the era of transparency.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe put our trust in him [Trump],\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m still going to support him, but with a slanted eye. We\u2019re the ones who put him where he is. It\u2019s totally disrespectful.\u201d",
      "But Richard Geiersbach, 66, a contractor wearing a MAGA hat, echoed a point that Trump has been making in recent days: Epstein isn\u2019t worth discussing anymore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a waste of time, a waste of money,\u201d he said. \u201cLet it go.\u201d"

But Amy Bradley\u2019s disappearance has never been solved. No body was found. No charges were filed. And no official explanation has ever been confirmed.",
      "Now, 26 years later, a new Netflix docuseries, \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing,\u201d looks back at her disappearance. Directed by Ari Mark and Phil Lott, the three-part series revisits key witness accounts and theories \u2014 from possible overboard scenarios to organized trafficking \u2014 while focusing on the family\u2019s decades-long search for answers.",
      "\u201cThe story has so many layers,\u201d Mark tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd when you sit with this family in their home and hear what they\u2019ve been through, you understand why this is a story that deserves to be told.\u201d",
      "A long-unsolved case",
      "Amy Bradley disappeared in the early morning hours of March 24, 1998, as the ship neared the island of Cura\u00e7ao.",
      "She was last seen asleep on her chair on the balcony of the ship\u2019s eighth deck at 4:30 a.m, according to the Curacao police, as reported by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in 1998.",
      "At the time, Netherlands Antilles Coast Guard Lt. Sjoerd Soethout said, to reporters, she may have fallen from the balcony.",
      "The FBI at the time searched the ship in St. Maarten, its next destination, and an FBI spokeswoman said the agency had \u201cno evidence of foul play,\u201d the AP reported at the time.",
      "The FBI is still offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to Bradley\u2019s recovery.",
      "The family\u2019s theories",
      "In the years since, dozens of explanations have circulated \u2014 including a theory she was kidnapped and speculation that she fell or jumped overboard.",
      "Her family has long believed she was taken against her will and may still be alive, which her parents, Ron and Iva Bradley, and brother Brad Bradley reiterate in the documentary.",
      "The docuseries does not offer a definitive conclusion. Instead, it builds a detailed timeline and walks viewers through how the investigation unfolded and where it hit dead ends. Throughout, the series places the Bradleys at the center of the story, offering a portrait of a family still living with questions. The docuseries also features interviews with people who believe they saw Amy Bradley at various locations in the Caribbean.",
      "\u201cThe thing that keeps them going, and kept us going, is that their hope is completely inextinguishable,\u201d Mark says. \u201cAmy is present for them every single second of every single day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery single day wasn\u2019t just another day of production, every single day was another day that Amy could be home,\u201d Lott adds.",
      "Ron and Iva Bradley filed two lawsuits on the same day against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in Miami-Dade court. Both were dismissed in 1999.",
      "Telling a story without a conclusion",
      "With no definitive conclusion to Amy Bradley\u2019s case, the filmmakers behind \u201cAmy Bradley Is Missing\u201d faced a challenge: how do you tell a complete story when the central mystery remains unsolved?",
      "\u201cWe really tried not to present anything to viewers that we didn\u2019t ourselves think was real or credible,\u201d Mark says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fact checking, a lot of information gathering and research that goes into these things so if certain leads had no substance we didn\u2019t put them in the show.\u201d",
      "That approach guided how they structured the series. The episodes aren\u2019t just a string of rumors \u2014 they follow a clear timeline, anchored by evidence, official reports and direct interviews. Each theory introduced in the series, whether involving foul play, accidental death, or human trafficking, is rooted in credible information, but never framed as the definitive truth.",
      "The result is a docuseries that resists sensationalism. Instead of promising answers, it leans into uncertainty, inviting viewers to sit with the discomfort that the Bradleys have lived with for more than two decades.",
      "\u201cYou go into a project like this thinking maybe you\u2019ll land somewhere. And instead, every time we thought we had a theory nailed down, something else would unravel it,\u201d Lott says. \u201cWe\u2019d find ourselves saying, \u2018OK, it\u2019s definitely this.\u2019 And then by the next day, \u2018Actually, no. It might be something else entirely.\u2019\u201d",
      "While they won\u2019t reveal which theory they personally believe, they agree that something shifted early that morning on the ship. \u201cSomething happened that cannot be explained at about 5:45 a.m. on that ship,\u201d Lott says. \u201cThat started the timeline that is not easy to answer.\u201d",
      "Mark adds that the ambiguity has never meant indifference. \u201cWe know there\u2019s more to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not so cut and dry.\u201d",
      "By Episode 3, the show has made its position clear: the point isn\u2019t to provide closure, because closure may never come. Instead, it\u2019s about creating clarity around the facts, while honoring the ambiguity that still defines Amy Bradley\u2019s case.",
      "What Amy Bradley\u2019s family is doing now",

      "That hope, unshaken after more than two decades, is what the filmmakers say anchored the entire project.",

      "Meanwhile, viewers grew endeared by Amaya; she shared candid confessionals, embraced her emotions (often by calling herself a \u201csensitive gangster\u201d), referred to herself in the third person (with the adorable nickname \u201cAmaya Papaya\u201d) and dropped plenty of one-liners that make for equal parts meme and life motivation.",

I felt like I grew up misunderstood in the outside world, and that definitely caught my attention. And once we started talking, I feel like we understood each other right away.",
      "Amaya: I definitely would have to say that my parents played a huge part in that. My father always told me that a strong, confident woman would always intimidate or scare the cowards.",
      "So I knew that it was just more of, like, projection on a lot of people\u2019s part. And instead of just viewing sadness as a weakness, it\u2019s a strength, and we are all blessed to have these emotions. And your girl\u2019s an emotional girl, a sensitive gangster.",
      "Amaya: To be honest, how well she defended herself. That was great to see. But I also saw three people kind of giving her a bad rep for stuff that I see are pearls, because I definitely want a woman that has those things, so I felt like I needed to speak up. They they said something about her calling people \u201cmi amor\u201d and \u201cbabe\u201d and stuff like that, and that\u2019s just how Hispanic people talk. I just felt like them saying something, I had to stand up and say something.",

      "And I would have to say that the power of the tongue is very powerful. And that\u2019s me doing positive affirmations. So there\u2019s a really huge, positive impact on doing that. You should be your own best friend no matter what.",
      "Amaya: I would definitely say: I\u2019m a butterfly that likes to be in the sky no matter if there\u2019s rain.",

      "Bryan: Right when we got our phones back, we were like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to call family.\u201d",
      "Amaya: It feels very surreal. But to see the love and to see our supporters, our extended family, it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to just feel validated and reassured.",
      "Bryan: You\u2019ve got to be grateful for it all. Obviously there\u2019s ups and downs, but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got each other, support each other, get through everything together.",
      "Amaya: To be honest, I let my intrusive thoughts win all the time. Like I really don\u2019t think before I speak. That\u2019s my creativity skill. Like, I\u2019m not the best drawer, but I could definitely just say things.",
      "Bryan: Her creativity is something different.",

      "You came into the world by yourself, you\u2019re leaving the world with yourself, so just literally enjoying your own presence.",
      "Amaya: (Laughs) I literally was always on good energy, high energy. I jog back home, so I wasn\u2019t able to jog in the villa besides my zoomies. So at least I was getting my steps in while doing that, right?",
      "Amaya: No. Amaya Papaya, that really started in the villa. Like one person just said it, and it became a waterfall. Everybody started saying it. And I\u2019m like, you know what? I like papayas, anyway, so why not?",
      "I ate a papaya a couple of days ago, and I was like, I usually don\u2019t eat my kids. I swear.",

      "Bryan: We started on camera, and we\u2019ll probably keep showing stuff, but obviously we want to protect us as well, so we\u2019re definitely going to keep some stuff private.",
      "Like she said, we just got our phones back, and we want to check on family and really spend time with each other without a mic or a camera in front of us. We\u2019re getting back to everybody and getting back to all the supporters that we\u2019re super grateful for. Just enjoying our time right now.",

      "\"I see the news that someone I never met in person has died, and it knocks the breath out of me and leaves me weeping,\" a commenter on YouTube replied to a post of the reading. \"Your light, your depth, your words have touched my soul. Your poetry has been the portal to a connection to you that makes our never having met in person meaningless. I love you, Andrea. Thank you for everything.\"",
      "\"Weeping,\" another read. \"I\u2019m weeping for love, for their love, for the beauty and truth that transcends death.\"",
      "\"Andrea Andrea Andrea forever with us, forever inspiring us,\" added one more. \"I lost my grandmother this spring, and I came to this conclusion too from the help of art and stories like this one. Sending so much love to Andrea\u2019s loved ones that will surely be grieving for quite some time. But having this love letter is more than enough to remember the truth.

    "summary": "President Trump rejected a military plan for more comprehensive strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program that would have lasted weeks, NBC News has also learned.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 One of the three nuclear enrichment sites in Iran struck by the United States last month was mostly destroyed, setting work there back significantly. But the two others were not as badly damaged and may have been degraded only to a point where nuclear enrichment could resume in the next several months if Iran wants it to, according to a recent U.S. assessment of the destruction caused by the military operation, five current and former U.S. officials familiar with the assessment told NBC News.",
      "The assessment, part of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing efforts to determine the status of Iran\u2019s nuclear program since the facilities were struck, was briefed to some U.S. lawmakers, Defense Department officials and allied countries in recent days, four of those people said.",
      "NBC News has also learned that U.S. Central Command had developed a much more comprehensive plan to strike Iran that would have involved hitting three additional sites in an operation that would have stretched for several weeks instead of a single night, according to a current U.S. official and two former U.S. officials.",
      "President Donald Trump was briefed on that plan, but it was rejected because it was at odds with his foreign policy instincts to extract the United States from conflicts abroad, not dig deeper into them, as well as the possibility of a high number of casualties on both sides, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said.",
      "\u201cWe were willing to go all the way in our options, but the president did not want to,\u201d one of the sources with knowledge of the plan said.",
      "In a speech in the hours after they took place, Trump called the strikes he directed \u201ca spectacular military success\u201d and said, \u201cIran\u2019s key enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\u201d",
      "The reality as gleaned through intelligence so far appears to be more nuanced. And if the early findings about the damage inflicted to Iran\u2019s nuclear program hold up as more intelligence comes in, the United States could find itself back in a conflict there.",
      "There have been discussions within both the American and Israeli governments about whether additional strikes on the two less-damaged facilities could be necessary if Iran does not soon agree to restart negotiations with the Trump administration on a nuclear deal or if there are signs Iran is trying to rebuild at those locations, one of the current officials and one of the former officials said. Iran has long said its nuclear program is purely for peaceful, civilian purposes.",
      "The recent assessment is a snapshot of the damage U.S. strikes inflicted amid an intelligence-gathering process that administration officials have said is expected to continue for months. Assessments of Iran\u2019s nuclear program after the U.S. strikes are expected to change over time, and according to two of the current officials, as the process progresses, the findings suggest more damage than previous assessments revealed. That assessment remains for now the current thinking on the impact of the strikes, officials said.",
      "\u201cAs the President has said and experts have verified, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities,\u201d White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement. \u201cAmerica and the world are safer, thanks to his decisive action.\u201d",
      "In a statement of his own, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said: \u201cThe credibility of the Fake News Media is similar to that of the current state of the Iranian nuclear facilities: destroyed, in the dirt, and will take years to recover. President Trump was clear and the American people understand: Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz were completely and totally obliterated. There is no doubt about that.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cOperation Midnight Hammer was a significant blow to Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities thanks to the decisive action of President Trump and the bravery of every man and woman in uniform who supported this mission.\u201d",
      "Destruction and deterrence",
      "The U.S. strikes targeted three enrichment sites in Iran: Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. U.S. officials believe the attack on Fordo, which has long been viewed as a critical component of Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions, was successful in setting back Iranian enrichment capabilities at that site by as much as two years, according to two of the current officials.",
      "Much of the administration\u2019s public messaging about the strikes has focused on Fordo. In a Pentagon briefing they held in response to reporting on an initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessment that concluded that Iran\u2019s nuclear program had been set back by only three to six months, for instance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, talked extensively about the strike at Fordo but not the strikes at Natanz and Isfahan.",
      "U.S. officials knew before the airstrikes that Iran had structures and enriched uranium at Natanz and Isfahan that were likely to be beyond the reach of even America\u2019s 30,000-pound GBU-57 \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs, three of the sources said. Those bombs, which had never been used in combat before the strikes, were designed with the deeply buried facilities carved into the side of a mountain at Fordo in mind.",
      "As early as 2023, though, there were indications that Iran was digging tunnels at Natanz that were below where the GBU-57 could reach. There are also tunnels deep underground at Isfahan. The United States hit surface targets at Isfahan with Tomahawk missiles and did not drop GBU-57s there, but it did use them at Natanz.",
      "White House officials pointed NBC News to a closed-door briefing conducted in late June by CIA Director John Ratcliffe, who told lawmakers that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d and that several key nuclear facilities were \u201ccompletely destroyed,\u201d according to an administration official\u2019s description of the briefing. Ratcliffe said the only metal conversion facility at Natanz, required for nuclear enrichment, was destroyed to the point that it would take \u201cyears to rebuild,\u201d according to a White House official who was authorized to describe some contents of the classified briefing.",
      "Ratcliffe also said that the intelligence community believes the strikes buried the vast majority of enriched uranium at Isfahan and Fordo and that thus it would be extremely difficult for the Iranians to extract it to resume enrichment, according to the official. The United States has not seen indications that Iran is trying to dig out the facilities, two officials said.",
      "As NBC News has reported, the Israeli government believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium remains intact but buried beneath the Isfahan facility, according to a senior Israeli government official who briefed reporters in Washington last week. The official said, however, that Israel considers the material effectively unreachable, because it is watching and will conduct new strikes if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the uranium. The official also said Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has been set back by up to two years.",
      "Similarly, even if the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were not completely destroyed, U.S. officials and Republican advocates of the operation believe it was a success because it has changed the strategic equation for Iran. From their point of view, the regime in Tehran now faces a credible threat of more airstrikes if Israel and the United States believe it is trying to revive clandestine nuclear work.",
      "Asked late last month whether he would consider bombing Iran again if intelligence reports concluded Iran can enrich uranium at a level that concerns him, Trump said: \u201cSure. Without question. Absolutely.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s air defenses have been largely destroyed, making it all but impossible for Iran to defend against further strikes on facilities in the future, the White House official said.",
      "\u201cIt was made clear that Iran no longer has any more [air defenses], so the idea that they can easily rebuild anything is ludicrous,\u201d the White House official said.",
      "The \u2018all-in\u2019 plan",
      "Beginning during the Biden administration, as early as last fall and into this spring, Army Gen. Erik Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command, had developed a plan to go \u201call-in\u201d on striking Iran, according to a current U.S. official and two former officials. That option was designed to \u201ctruly decimate\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, in the words of one of the former officials.",
      "Under the plan, the United States would have hit six sites. The thinking was that the six sites would have to be hit repeatedly to inflict the kind of damage necessary to completely end the program, people familiar with the thinking said. The plan would also have involved targeting more of Iran\u2019s air defense and ballistic missile capabilities, and planners projected it could result in a high number of Iranian casualties. U.S. officials expected that if that were to take place, Iran would target American positions, for example in Iraq and Syria, a person familiar with the plan said.",
      "\u201cIt would be a protracted air campaign,\u201d the person said.",
      "Some Trump administration officials believed a deeper offensive option against Iran was a viable policy, two of the former officials said.",
      "Trump was briefed on the so-called all-in plan, but it was rejected ultimately because it would have required a sustained period of conflict.",
      "The history",
      "During his first term, in 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that was negotiated during the Obama administration. The agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, imposed strict limits on Iran\u2019s nuclear program in return for an easing of economic sanctions.",
      "Under the deal, Iran was a year away from obtaining enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. After Trump withdrew from the accord and reimposed sanctions, Iran flouted restrictions on its uranium enrichment. Before the June airstrikes, the regime had enough fissile material for about nine to 10 bombs, according to U.S. officials and United Nations inspectors.",
      "Trump has since sought a new agreement with Iran that would block it from developing nuclear weapons. Indirect talks between U.S. and Iranian officials failed to clinch a deal before Israel launched airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "Iran has long denied that it wants to build a nuclear weapon, a position its foreign minister reiterated in an interview with NBC News the day before the U.S. strikes."

      "Walking down a row of incubators in the neonatal unit of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, head of the facility's pediatric unit, shared each baby's story one by one.",
      "\"This baby is a full-term baby,\" he told NBC News' crew on the ground Thursday, gesturing at a tiny figure tucked into an incubator, wrapped in only his diaper and with an oxygen tube fixed to his nose with surgical tape.",
      "\"As you can see, he is depending on the mechanical ventilation,\" Al-Farra said. \"If the electricity was cut off ... this baby will not survive.\"",
      "His warning evokes memories of early on in the war, when a number of infants died at hospitals in northern Gaza after repeated warnings that a military assault in the area would end up being fatal for the babies.",
      "Nasser Hospital is just one of several facilities in Gaza facing \"imminent shutdown\" as fuel stocks in the enclave run out, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned Wednesday.

      "\"It was phenomenal,\" Farrell said.",

      "The grassroots Maharees Conservation Association wants to use this story to link up with people in Newfoundland experiencing the same issues. And the author of the letter in the bottle is going to connect them.",
      "\"They have a soft coastline, they have a sand dune system, and they are also vulnerable to sea level rises,\" Farrell said. \"It's a somber enough affair when you're thinking: How can we actually prepare ourselves for what's to come? So to have this little moment of pure joy in the middle of that, it was very welcome.\"",

      "\"The images were organized into folders named after the victims, totaling 700+ images (including the original photos),\" read a widely circulated letter that was posted Saturday on Instagram from an account run by three unnamed victims.",
      "The accused, referred to in the letter only as \u201ca male law student,\u201d took photos of the victims from social media and used AI software to generate pornographic images with their faces, according to the letter. The images were discovered on his laptop reported to the university in February. They were not known to have been widely distributed.",
      "In March, the university interviewed some of the victims, and in April informed one of them that the accused student had written a 60-word \"apology letter.\"",
      "While NBC News was unable to confirm the authenticity of that letter, and the account did not respond to a request for comment, the university said it was \"aware of the social media posts concerning a student allegedly using AI tools to create indecent images.\"",
      "\u201cThe University has already issued him a warning letter and demanded him a formal apology to his affected peers,\u201d the university said Saturday in a statement.",
      "Deepfake porn is a type of nonconsensual pornography that involves altering existing images or creating entirely new ones using readily available AI tools to make it appear that a person has participated in sexual acts.",
      "Regulations in Hong Kong around the technology are currently sparse. While it criminalizes \u201cpublication or threatened publication of intimate images without consent,\u201d it does not explicitly outlaw their generation.",
      "In the U.S., regulations govern dissemination, with President Donald Trump signing legislation in May that bans nonconsensual online publication of AI-generated porn, but federal law does not explicitly prohibit personal possession, and a district judge ruled in February that possessing such images was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "After it was rocked by a number of scandals similar to the one playing out in Hong Kong, South Korea passed a law last year that criminalizes not only the possession but also the consumption of such content.",
      "Though the University of Hong Kong said that it had undertaken various steps on behalf of the victims, \u201cincluding class adjustments,\u201d the victims wrote in the letter that the university\u2019s inaction had resulted in them being forced to share the classroom with the suspect \u201cat least four times, causing unnecessary psychological distress.\u201d",
      "Outrage has since grown in the wider student community, which has demanded more stringent action. That prompted a response from the city\u2019s top official, Chief Executive John Lee, who said at a news briefing Tuesday that universities have the \u201cresponsibility of developing students\u2019 moral character,\u201d adding institutions should \u201cdeal with student misconduct seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny conduct that causes harm to others may constitute a criminal offense and may also infringe individual rights and also privacy,\u201d he said.",
      "The university did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but it told the South China Morning Post this week that it was conducting a review of the incident and vowed further action if victims demanded more.",
      "\u201cThe university is now further reviewing the case and will take further actions when appropriate to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment,\u201d it said."

      "Most concerning, Liu added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",

Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December. The memo did not say which state.",

      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Europe is sounding the alarm: Tariffs could soon be hitting wallets of people in the United States.",
      "The 30% tariffs on European Union imports, announced by President Donald Trump on Saturday, could be a \u201cdeath blow\u201d to the European food industry and lead to price hikes for American consumers, the Italian winemakers association UIV said. \u201cThe 30% tariff on wine \u2026 would be virtually an embargo on 80% of Italian wine,\u201d the group added, according to a translated statement.",
      "Coldiretti, an association that represents European agricultural companies, said American consumers would likely face shortages or see price hikes for imported wine, cheese and pastas.",
      "And German industry association BDI called the escalation \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d warning that it threatened jobs and investment worldwide. Germany is the top E.U. exporter to the U.S.",
      "Cars and other vehicles produced in the E.U. could also face increased prices. \"The costs for our companies have already reached the billions\u2014and with each passing day, the total continues to grow,\" the German auto trade group VDA told NBC News in a statement Monday.",
      "Those statements come after Trump sent a letter to the E.U. (and a separate one to Mexico) on Saturday threatening a blanket 30% tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. starting Aug. 1, an indication that ongoing trade negotiations have failed. After initially backing down from his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and promising trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has steadily returned to his trade war posture, sending letters to countries around the world with ultimatums and tariff rates from 20% to 40%.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key source of U.S. food and wine exports, said Saturday he strongly disapproved of the 30% tariff and urged the E.U. to speed up \u201cthe preparation of credible countermeasures.\u201d He said trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe \u201cowe each other\u201d respect.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. was the top destination for E.U. exports. The top exported products from the E.U. to the U.S. last year were medical and pharmaceutical products, medicines, motor vehicles and machinery, according to Eurostat.",
      "Trump has threatened sector-specific tariffs on pharmaceutical products, although it\u2019s not clear when those might be unveiled.",
      "Ireland\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Harris, one of the first E.U. leaders to react to Trump\u2019s Saturday letter, said \u201cthere is no necessity to escalate the situation.\u201d Harris said he planned to meet with the U.S. ambassador to Ireland on Monday to discuss the situation.",
      "Ireland is the top source of U.S. pharma imports from the E.U., and serves as the European headquarters of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta.",
      "Speaking in Brussels on Monday after a meeting of E.U. trade ministers, the European Commission\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said the 30% tariff \u201cis absolutely unacceptable. That is the level which is absolutely prohibitive to any trade.\u201d",
      "Last year, the total value of E.U.-U.S. trade amounted to nearly $2 trillion.",
      "Some are still expressing hope for a deal.",
      "\u201cThe clear impression was that we were very, very close in agreement in principle,\u201d Denmark\u2019s foreign minister said Monday after the trade ministers meeting. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible due to this presidential letter, but it is still our major vision that we should reach an agreement, but we also want to send signal that it must be a fair deal for everybody.\u201d",
      "For its part, the E.U. has delayed any countermeasures \u2014 or retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u2014 but it currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby.",
      "Some of that retaliation targets goods and produce from politically sensitive U.S. states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state of Louisiana or bourbon from Kentucky. Other retaliatory tariffs could target Boeing planes and U.S.-built vehicles.",
      "The American Chamber of Commerce in the E.U. said it was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the tariffs that it said would \u201cgenerate damaging ripple effects across all sectors of the EU and US economies.\u201d The group added that \u201ctariffs disrupt supply chains and add costs and complexity for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.\u201d",
      "Despite the major escalation, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said that he planned to speak with his American counterparts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on Monday to keep negotiations going."
