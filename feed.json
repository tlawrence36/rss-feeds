    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",
      "Buried in here are some tender reflections on mortality and misguided exceptionalism, and even the hint of those ideas make \u201c28 Years Later\u201d a more thoughtful movie than you\u2019re likely to find at the multiplex this time of year. This is an unusually soulful coming-of-age movie considering the number of spinal cords that get ripped right of bodies.",
      "It's enough to make you admire the stubborn persistence of Boyle in these films, which he's already extending. The already-shot \u201c28 Days Later: The Bone Temple\u201d is coming next near, from director Nia DaCosta, while Boyle hopes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is the start of trilogy. Infection and rage, it turns out, are just too well suited to our times to stop now.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, grisly images, graphic nudity, language and brief sexuality. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "Jeezy is launching his orchestra-backed \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Jeezy released his commercial debut two decades ago, he prepared a contingency plan in case his musical aspirations weren\u2019t achieved.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",
      "If you\u2019re doing something to change your life and you know that the only other avenues are prison or death, you\u2019re just like, \u201cThis gotta work.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: It\u2019s like a tree: It grows where it\u2019s soft at, not where it is hard. It\u2019s just like over time, leaves fall off, branches fall off but the tree continues to grow.",
      "Everybody don\u2019t have the same vision or goals. And if you allow them, they\u2019ll sink the ship \u2014 or they\u2019ll chop down the tree.",
      "JEEZY: I just live my life, man. You know, joy, peace, and freedom, brother. I don\u2019t know these people, so I can\u2019t even feel no type of way. That\u2019s on them \u2014 I got better things to do. I\u2019ve got goals, dreams, aspirations, so I don\u2019t get caught up in it, \u2019cause I don\u2019t go for the good, either. \u2026 I\u2019m not reading the comments to see what somebody said about me good, because none of it matters.",
      "JEEZY: I do want to shout out LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation) which is my partner on my nonprofit space. They\u2019re amazing. We\u2019re actually focusing in on prostate cancer, and then also helping the inner city youth with education, entrepreneurship. ... I\u2019d like to shout out the Urban League of Atlanta, and we have the Young CEOs program.",
      "It\u2019s great to put out projects, it\u2019s great to do tours. But it\u2019s also great to help your people in the process.",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "North Carolina alt-country indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting",
      "NEW YORK -- A pit bull puppy peeing off a balcony. Mounted antlers in the kitchen on a crooked nail. Pink boiled eggs stay afloat in the brine. For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",
      "And that says nothing of what they sound like. The most exciting band in contemporary indie rock is informed by Drive-By Truckers and Pavement in equal measure, a distinctive sonic fabric of lap steel, guitar fuzz, folksy and jagged vocals.",
      "On Sept. 19, they will release their sixth and most ambitious full-length, \u201cBleeds.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy songwriting is just better on this album,\u201d Wednesday's singer and songwriter Karly Hartzman explains. \u201cThings are said more succinctly ... the immediacy of these songs was the main growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",
      "So, let the bloodletting begin.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "The titles that have packed the most summer moviegoers into theaters since 1975 represent some of the best known films of the last half century, including five \u201cStar Wars\u201d movies, Pixar favorites like \u201cToy Story 3\u201d and \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d superheroes galore and both \u201cTop Gun\u201d films.

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "Kelce, a Super Bowl-winning tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, is a known hockey fan along with his brother Jason Kelce.

    "story": [
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "A new COVID-19 variant may be causing \u201crazor blade\u201d sore throats in people who get it",
      "The COVID-19 variant that may be driving a recent rise in cases in some parts of the world has earned a new nickname: \u201crazor blade throat\u201d COVID.",
      "That's because the variant \u2014 NB.1.8.1. or \u201cNimbus\u201d \u2014 may cause painful sore throats. The symptom has been identified by doctors in the United Kingdom, India and elsewhere, according to media outlets in those countries.",

      "Experts say there isn't major cause for concern with the Nimbus variant, but here 's what else you need to know about it.",
      "The rise in cases late last month is primarily in eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions, the World Health Organization said May 28. The new variant had reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported globally in mid-May.",

    "summary": "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
    "story": [
      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "A federal court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from clawing back millions in public health funding from four Democrat-led municipalities in GOP-governed states.",
      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",
      "Representatives for HHS, the CDC and the cities did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",

      "April Newkirk told WXIA-TV that 31-year-old Adriana Smith's baby was born prematurely by an emergency cesarean section early Friday, the Atlanta station reported Monday night. She was about six months into her pregnancy. The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead. She was eight weeks pregnant, according to WXIA.",

      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",

The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",

Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",

The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "A new poll shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs Republicans in Congress have focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",
      "The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",
      "Many Americans see Medicaid and food assistance programs as underfunded \u2014 even as Congress proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and food and nutrition assistance programs \u2014 and few say \u201ctoo much\u201d money is going to these programs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults say \u201ctoo little\u201d funding goes to Medicaid, which is a government health care coverage program for low-income people and people with certain disabilities. Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",
      "About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.",
      "Republicans are especially likely to say \u201ctoo much\u201d is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents \u2014 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents.",
      "When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think \u201ctoo little\u201d money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo.",
      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",
      "When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security.",
      "About 3 in 10 say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending \u201ctoo little.\u201d Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d",
      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",
      "The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives.",
      "Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is \u201ctoo much\u201d federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "The mummy had gone unnoticed despite urban development in a district of Lima where former agricultural fields have been converted into working-class neighborhoods in recent decades.

      "Doubling in strength in less than a day and expected to further grow further, Hurricane Erick is chugging through the ideal environment to power up quickly as it approaches Mexico's southern Pacific Coast",
      "WASHINGTON -- Having doubled in strength in less than a day and still expected to grow further, Hurricane Erick on Wednesday chugged through the ideal environment to power up quickly as it approached Mexico's southern Pacific Coast.",
      "This type of rapid intensification has become more common in a warmer climate, especially in the Atlantic and near the United States, which is not where Erick is now, scientists said. Last year, there were there 34 incidents of rapid intensification \u2014 when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours \u2014 which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "Erick, an otherwise run-of-the-mill hurricane that's strong but not unusual, gained 50 mph in just 18 hours and was still powering up as it neared the coast.",
      "Because of where it's heading \u2014 near Acapulco \u2014 and it's rapid intensification, Erick brings back bad memories of deadly Otis, which seemed to come from out of nowhere to smack Mexico with a top-of-the-scale Category 5 hurricane in 2023. But Erick is no Otis, especially because of their timing. Erick is an early-season storm and Otis hit in October.",
      "Forming in October, Otis grew stronger by churning up deeper warmer water because it was later in the year. Erick is early in the year and the deep water it would churn up is cooler and doesn't fuel rapid intensification. Even so, the surface water is plenty hot enough, said MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel.",
      "All the ingredients are otherwise perfect for Erick's power-up, said University at Albany atmospheric scientist Kristen Corbosiero. Dry air often stops rapid intensification, but Erick hasn't run into dry air and the atmosphere around it is extremely moist, she said. It's got a good stormy eye forming and has what would be the ideal shape of a strengthening storm, she said.",
      "The water around Erick is warm enough for a storm to form and power up quickly, but it\u2019s not warmer than normal for this time of year, so that\u2019s not odd, Corbosiero said. However, it\u2019s warm enough that it is \u201ca pretty safe bet\u2033 that it will continue to gain strength until it gets close to land, Emanuel said.",
      "Studies have linked human-caused climate change in general to more bouts of rapid intensification, as well as wetter and slower storms, Corbosiero said. But it would take more study, usually after the storm hits, to find any potential link between global warming and Erick in particular, if there is one, she said.",
      "Aside from its quick powering up, Erick \u201cdoesn't seem to be particularly unusual,\u201d Corbosiero said.",
      "The only thing that's unusual so far is that this is the fifth eastern Pacific storm a month into the season there, which is a little more active than normal, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. And it's likely that when Erick hits, it will be the strongest storm to make landfall in that part of Mexico this early in the season, he said.",

      "The Czech government has survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote over a bitcoin-related scandal",
      "PRAGUE -- The Czech government survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote called by the main opposition party on Wednesday over a bitcoin-related scandal.",
      "Only 94 opposition lawmakers in the 200-seat lower house of Parliament voted in favor of dismissing the four-party coalition led by conservative Prime Minister Petr Fiala.",
      "At least 101 votes were needed to oust the government at the end of a two-day debate.",
      "The main opposition centrist ANO (YES) movement led by populist billionaire Andrej Babi\u0161 requested the vote after the Justice Ministry accepted a donation of bitcoins and sold them for almost 1 billion Czech koruna ($47 million) earlier this year.",
      "Justice Minister Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from his post over the issue on May 30 and was replaced by Eva Decroix on June 10.",
      "Bla\u017eek said he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the coalition to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said he believed Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",
      "Decroix said she will order an independent probe into the ministry\u2019s activities in the case.",
      "The scandal focuses on the fact that the bitcoins were donated to the ministry by a person who was previously convicted of drug dealing and other crimes, while it was not clear why he did it.",
      "The opposition has accused Bla\u017eek of possible money laundering, because it wasn\u2019t clear where the bitcoins originated, and demanded the resignation of the entire government. The issue is being investigated by the national police\u2019s organized crime unit.",
      "It was the fourth no-confidence motion since the government took over after a 2021 election.",
      "The scandal comes just months before the Oct. 3-4 parliamentary election. Babi\u0161 and his movement are predicted to win the vote.",

      "Lungu's body was initially due to be repatriated last weekend following seven days of national mourning, but the family didn't allow that because of disagreements over the funeral program.

      "Fans in Greece are paying their respects to clarinetist Petroloukas Chalkias, whose hypnotic, note-bending performances over the course of seven decades made him a hero of mountain folk music",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- ATHENS, Greece (AP) \u2014 Greece is honoring the late clarinetist Petroloukas Chalkias, whose hypnotic, note-bending performances over the course of more than 70 years made him a hero of mountain folk music.",
      "Chalkias, who died at 90 over the weekend, lay in state Wednesday at the Athens Cathedral \u2014 a rare honor typically reserved for prime ministers and religious leaders.",
      "As pallbearers emerged through the doors in a chapel next to the cathedral, carrying the coffin, silence descended. Mourners then clapped and shouted \u201cimmortal\u201d as musicians played folk tunes. It was a solemn prelude to his funeral which will take place in the rugged highlands of Epirus, in northwest Greece, where he first took up the clarinet as a boy of 11.",
      "Greek President Constantine Tassoulas earlier this week described Chalkias as a \u201clegendary figure.\u201d",
      "Epirus\u2019 folk music, slowly unfolding and often centered around the clarinet, is steeped in improvisation, with its wanderings inviting comparisons to rural blues and jazz. It\u2019s one of the reasons that, while not so distinguished as a recording artist, Chalkias\u2019 live performances made him a household name for Greeks young and old alike.",
      "His style evolved after settling in New York as a young man, joining a wave of musicians who emigrated along with other Greeks to escape the hardship of postwar poverty. Chalkias found an unlikely second stage: dimly-lit clubs filled with Greek emigres and curious outsiders. Among those drawn to his performances were jazz legends Benny Goodman and Louis Armstrong.",
      "Musicians paying their respects on Wednesday praised Chalkias for his generosity with his time in helping fellow artists. \u201cI was a young woman when I started out and I was incredibly lucky to have him support me,\u201d folk singer Giota Griva said. \u201cHis influence was immense. He was an artist who will never leave us.\u201d",
      "Born Petros Loukas Chalkias, the musician was the son and grandson of clarinet players. He was raised with the region\u2019s rich tradition of live music \u2014 an essential part of village festivals, celebrations, and mourning rituals.",
      "Discouraged at first by a family wary of the musician\u2019s path, the young Chalkias fashioned his own makeshift clarinet from a hollow reed, carving its finger holes. By his early teens, his playing \u2014 raw and instinctive, but undeniably gifted \u2014 was good enough to earn him a spot on national radio.",

      "One of Armenia\u2019s richest men has been arrested and appeared in court accused of making public calls to illegally seize power",
      "YEREVAN, Armenia -- One of richest men in Armenia has been arrested on charges of making public calls to seize power in the country illegally, his lawyer said Wednesday, as a feud between Armenia\u2019s prime minister and the nation's dominant church intensified.",
      "Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan has long had a tumultuous relationship with the Armenian Apostolic Church and billionaire Samvel Karapetyan now seems to have been caught up in it.",
      "Karapetyan, 59, was detained late on Tuesday night and appeared in front of a court in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on Wednesday, according to Armen Feroyan, his attorney.",
      "The lawyer said Karapetyan denied the charges against him. Karapetyan, who also holds Russian citizenship, owns the Tashir Group, a conglomerate that operates residential and commercial real estate as well as the Electric Networks of Armenia.",
      "Pashinyan, the prime minister, told journalists on Wednesday that the power company would be nationalized \u201csoon\u201d following Karapetyan\u2019s arrest.",
      "Before his arrest, Karapetyan said in video released Tuesday, that \u201ca small group of people who have forgotten the thousand-year history of Armenia and the church\u201d were attacking the religious institution.",
      "\u201cI have always stood with the Armenian Church and the Armenian people,\u201d the billionaire said. \"If the politicians do not succeed, we will intervene in our own way in this campaign against the church.\u201d",
      "The remarks were seen as a jab at Pashinyan, who on June 8 called for the head of Armenia\u2019s church, Catholicos Karekin II, to resign after accusing him of fathering a child while under a vow of celibacy. At the time, the church released a statement accusing Pashinyan of undermining Armenia's \u201cspiritual unity\u201d but did not address the claim about the child.",
      "Pashinyan responded, promising on Facebook to crack down on \u201cdepraved\u201d members of the clergy and their benefactors.",
      "\u201cHe says \u2018we will intervene in our own way\u2019,\u201d Pashinyan wrote, apparently citing Karapetyan. \u201cNow I will intervene in my own way.\u201d",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, the prime minister dismissed the head of the country\u2019s national security service, Armen Abazyan. When asked by journalists if the move was linked to the billionaire's arrest, Pashinyan only said the security chief \u201cdeserved to rest a little\u201d after a difficult tenure.",

      "MILAN -- The British superyacht that sank off Sicily last August killing seven is scheduled to be lifted from the seabed this weekend, after the removal of its 72-meter (236-foot) mast, the salvage company heading the operation said Wednesday.",
      "The cutting down of the Bayesian's mast allowed the hull to be brought to a nearly upright position, accelerating the recovery schedule by about a week.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "The vessel is to be lifted from a depth of 50 meters (164 feet) by a powerful maritime floating crane barge on Saturday, weather permitting, and is expected to be brought to port on Monday, TMC Marine said in a statement. The mast, meanwhile, was left on the seabed for future removal.",
      "Lifting the 56-meter (184-foot) Bayesian requires the installation of eight main steel lifting straps, along with four previously installed, the company said.",
      "During the recent operations, salvage crews removed a life raft and deck furniture, which were brought to the port. TMC has previously recovered suspected debris from the seabed using a remote-controlled submersible.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, but the operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later. A new recovery plan was approved last week.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",
      "Italian authorities are conducting a full criminal investigation.",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Lynch, 59, and his daughter Hannah, 18, were among the dead when the Bayesian sank. Fifteen people survived. The boat trip was a celebration of Lynch\u2019s acquittal in a fraud case in the U.S. in June. Fifteen people survived the accident.",

      "The precautionary inspections, including closure of airspace in some middle eastern countries, have strained Air India operations across domestic and international routes.",

      "The company on Tuesday announced cancellation of multiple flights, including one from Ahmedabad to London Gatwick. Another from Delhi to Paris was cancelled as a mandatory pre-flight check identified an unidentified issue, the airline said in a statement.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the aviation directorate said surveillance conducted on Air India\u2019s Dreamliner fleet so far has found no \u201cmajor safety concerns.\u201d",
      "The aircrafts and its associated maintenance systems were found to be compliant with existing safety standards, the directorate said, adding that of the 33 aircrafts, 24 have completed the inspections, while four were undergoing long-term maintenance. The rest were expected to finish the safety checks soon.",

      "The company already has placed huge orders for new aircrafts to expand operations. The present challenge was to boost the morale of employees and passengers through confidence building measures, Bhargava said.",
      "\u201cThe faster you make people forget this one-off accident, the better it is,\u201d Bhargava said.",
      "Indian conglomerate Tata Sons took over Air India in 2022, returning the debt-saddled national carrier to private ownership after decades of government control. The $2.4 billion deal was seen as the government\u2019s effort to sell off a loss-making, state-run businesses. It also was in some ways a homecoming for Air India, which was launched by the Tata family in 1932.",
      "Since the takeover, Air India has ordered hundreds of new planes worth over $70 billion, redesigned its branding and livery and absorbed smaller airlines Tata held stakes in. The company additionally has committed millions of dollars to digital overhauls of aircrafts and refurbishing interiors of more than five dozen legacy planes.",
      "Air India has ordered nearly three dozen trainer aircrafts and set up one of South Asia\u2019s largest training academy for professionals.",

      "This is Iran\u2019s capital city, just under a week into a fierce Israeli blitz to destroy the country's nuclear program and its military capabilities. After knocking out much of Iran's air defense system, Israel says its warplanes have free rein over the city's skies. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday told Tehran's roughly 10 million residents to evacuate \u201cimmediately.\u201d",

      "Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 585 people and wounded over 1,300, a human rights group says. Local media, themselves targets of bombardment, have stopped reporting on the attacks, leaving Iranians in the dark. There are few visible signs of state authority: Police appear largely undercover, air raid sirens are unreliable, and there\u2019s scant information on what to do in case of attack.",
      "Shirin, 49, who lives in the southern part of Tehran, said every call or text to friends and family in recent days has felt like it could be the last.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if tomorrow we will be alive,\u201d she said.",
      "Many Iranians feel conflicted. Some support Israel's targeting of Iranian political and military officials they see as repressive. Others staunchly defend the Islamic Republic and retaliatory strikes on Israel. Then, there are those who oppose Iran\u2019s rulers \u2014 but still don't want to see their country bombed.",
      "The Associated Press interviewed five people in Iran and one Iranian American in the U.S. over the phone. All spoke either on the condition of anonymity or only allowed their first names to be used, for fear of retribution from the state against them or their families.",

      "Still, hoping escape might be possible, she spent the last several days trying to gather their medications. Her brother waited at a gas station until 3 a.m., only to be turned away when the fuel ran out. As of Monday, gas was being rationed to under 20 liters (5 gallons) per driver at stations across Iran after an Israeli strike set fire to the world's largest gas field.",

      "The 22-year-old has been staying in the house with his parents since the initial Israeli strike. He said his once-lively neighborhood of Saadat Abad in northwestern Tehran is now a ghost town. Schools are closed. Very few people even step outside to walk their dogs. Most local stores have run out of drinking water and cooking oil. Others closed.",
      "Still, Arshia said the prospect of finding a new place is too daunting.",

      "Those who choose to relocate do so without help from the government. The state has said it is opening mosques, schools and metro stations for use as shelters. Some are closed, others overcrowded.",
      "Hundreds crammed into one Tehran metro station Friday night. Small family groups lay on the floor. One student, a refugee from another country, said she spent 12 hours in the station with her relatives.",

      "\u201cFor immigrant communities, this is so hard to live in this kind of situation,\u201d she said, explaining she feels like she has nowhere to escape to \u2014 especially not her home country, which she asked not be identified.",

      "Putin scheduled a roundtable session with senior news leaders of international news agencies, including The Associated Press.

      "\u201cThe leaders agreed to designate new high commissioners, with a view to returning to regular services to citizens and businesses in both countries,\u201d a statement from Carney\u2019s office said.",

New Delhi vehemently denied the allegations and accused Trudeau\u2019s government of harboring extremists.",
      "The Indian government had declared Nijjar a terrorist in 2020 under a law meant to suppress dissent. The Sikh independence advocate was a prominent member of the Khalistan movement, banned in India, to create an independent Sikh homeland. He was seen as a human rights activist by Sikh organizations.",

      "In recent weeks, Trump had claimed to have brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan and offered trade concessions in part to make the nuclear-armed rivals reach an agreement after shooting at each other for days, which was checkmate by New Delhi. Trump had also proposed mediation over Kashmir.",
      "In a statement, Misri said Modi clarified to Trump that India had never in the past accepted nor would it encourage in the future a third-party mediation over the simmering dispute of Kashmir, a Himalayan region claimed by both India and Pakistan in its entirety.",
      "Misri said Modi made it clear to Trump that during multiple talks held between New Delhi and Washington senior officials amid the ongoing military conflict, there was no mention of a trade deal or the U.S. mediation over Kashmir.",
      "The talks to stop military actions were held directly between the military leaders of India and Pakistan through existing channels, Misri said.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about the latest dispute between the two Southeast Asian neighbors.",
      "The recent dispute was triggered in May after armed forces of Thailand and Cambodia briefly fired at each other in a relatively small \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d constituting territory along their border that both countries claim as their own.",
      "Both sides have said they acted in self-defense. One Cambodian soldier was killed.",
      "While the countries said afterwards they have agreed to de-escalate the situation, Cambodian and Thai authorities continue to implement or threaten measures short of armed force at each other, keeping tensions high.",
      "Thailand has added restrictions at the border such as limiting crossing times and barring Thai casino tourists and workers from crossing into Cambodia.",
      "Cambodia has banned Thai movies and TV shows, stopped the import of Thai fruits and vegetables and boycotted its neighbor's international internet links and power supply.",
      "Border disputes are long-standing issues that have caused periodic tensions between the two neighbors. Thailand and Cambodia share more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) of land border.",
      "The contesting claims stem largely from a 1907 map drawn under French colonial rule that was used to separate Cambodia from Thailand.",
      "Cambodia has been using the map as a reference to claim territory, while Thailand has argued the map is inaccurate.",
      "In February, Cambodian troops and their family members entered an ancient temple along the border in one of the disputed areas and sang the Cambodian national anthem, leading to a brief argument with Thai troops.",
      "The most prominent and violent conflicts broke out around the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple.",
      "In 1962, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) awarded sovereignty over the area to Cambodia and that became a major irritant in relations.",
      "Cambodia went back to the court in 2011, following several clashes between its army and Thai forces which killed about 20 and displaced thousands of people. The court reaffirmed the ruling in 2013, a decision that still rattled Thailand.",
      "Similar to the Phear Vihear area, Cambodia is seeking a ruling again from the ICJ over several disputed areas, including where the deadly clash happened.",
      "Thailand has said it doesn\u2019t accept the jurisdiction of the ICJ and that any conflicting border claims between the two should be solved by the existing bilateral mechanism, including a joint committee which was established in 2000 as a technical means to discuss the survey and demarcation of the land border.",
      "Cambodia nevertheless said it has submitted the case to the ICJ, and insisted that it would no longer discuss these areas under the two countries' bilateral mechanism.",
      "Tensions have soared as they engaged in a war of words that appeared intended to mollify nationalistic critics on both sides of the border.",
      "The ill feeling between the two neighbors is not just about overlapping border claims, but also deep-seated cultural enmity that has its roots from centuries ago, when they were large and competing empires.",
      "In more modern times, bad feelings have lingered, as Cambodia\u2019s development, hindered by French colonialism and, in the 1970s, the brutal rule of the communist Khmer Rouge, has fallen well behind Thailand.",
      "Both have fought over claims on cultural products ranging from boxing, mask dancing, traditional clothing and food.",

      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle",
      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year, announcing its intent Wednesday to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said sterile male New World screwworm flies bred at the $8.5 million facility would be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying the eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larva. It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.",
      "The fly's appearance in southern Mexico late last year has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians' groups, and the U.S. last month suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,\" Rollins said. She held a news conference at Moore Air Base with Texas and cattle industry officials.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said in a post Wednesday on X that Rollins\u2019 plan \u201cseems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-US work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer. Pressure from the U.S. prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larva can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\u201cThe only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\u201d Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful that the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat serious and pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration as well and see having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile one is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\u201cWe have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\u201d Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\u201d",

      "From cosmetics to snacks and signature spirits, brands launched or co-owned by high-profile figures are just about everywhere you look today. But several big names are also venturing into the market for mobile virtual network operators \u2014 or MVNOs, an industry term for businesses that provide cell coverage by leasing infrastructure from bigger, more established carriers.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's family was the most recent to join the list with the launch of Trump Mobile this week. Here's what to know.",
      "On Monday, The Trump Organization (currently run by the president's sons Eric and Donald Jr.) unveiled Trump Mobile. The company says this new business will offer cell service, through an apparent licensing deal with \u201call three major cellular carriers\" in the U.S., and sell gold phones by August.",
      "Trump Mobile marks the latest in a string of new Trump-branded offerings \u2014 which already span from golden sneakers to \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d bibles \u2014 despite mounting ethical concerns that the president is profiting off his position and could distort public policy for personal gain.",
      "\"This raises a real question about a conflict of interest,\u201d said Ben Bentzin, an associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s McCombs School of Business. As the sitting president, Trump appoints leadership for the Federal Communications Commission \u2014 and the family's new phone venture exists under this regulatory authority.",
      "All of this sets Trump Mobile apart from other big names that have recently ventured into the wireless business. Still, its launch arrives as a growing number of celebrities tap into this space.",

      "Another wireless provider with ties to fame is Mint Mobile. While not launched by celebrities, Ryan Reynolds purchased an ownership stake in Mint in 2019. Mint's parent, the Ka\u2019ena Corporation, was later acquired by T-Mobile in a deal worth up to $1.35 billion.",
      "Beyond names of famous people, well-known brands that weren't traditionally in the phone business have also got in on the action over the years \u2014 particuarly outside of the U.S., Forrester Research senior analyst Octavio Garcia Granados notes. He points to Walmart's \u201cBait\u201d mobile plan in Mexico, for example, as well as Italian soccer club AC Milan launching its own mobile SIM cards for fans.",
      "\u201cThe MVNO market is not new,\" said Garcia Granados. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is the development on how it\u2019s consumed and the (ease) for brands to launch such plans.\u201d",
      "MVNOs have also emerged outside of high-profile brands or launch teams. Bentzin points to Straight Talk and Cricket \u2014 which are now owned by Verizon and AT&T, respectively. Still, traditional celebrity endorsements are common across the board. And in recent years, \u201cinfluencer marketing\" has been \u201cthe fastest growing area of advertising and promotion,\" he notes.",
      "For Trump Mobile, the pitch seems to be all about having an \u201call-American service\" while also tapping into the fan base of the president.",
      "The company noted Monday that it chose to unveil Trump Mobile on the 10th anniversary of Trump launching \"his historic presidential campaign.\u201d The name given to its flagship offer, The 47 Plan, and the $47.45 monthly fee make reference to the president's two terms. And a mock-up of the planned gold phone on the company\u2019s website shows Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great\u201d slogan on the front screen.",
      "According to the company, Trump Mobile's 47 Plan will include unlimited calls, texts and data through partner carriers, as well as free roadside assistance and telehealth services. It also says the new phone, called the \u201cT1 Phone,\u201d will be available for $499 in August \u2014 but notes that this device won\u2019t be designed or made by Trump Mobile. Still, the company emphasized that these phones will be built in the U.S.",
      "Experts have since shared skepticism about that being possible in two months. And beyond the future T1 Phone, others stress that a monthly cell service fee of just under $50 is pricey compared to other MVNO options today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not actual lower pricing. It\u2019s really trading on the fan base, if you will, of Trump,\u201d said Bentzin.",
      "SmartLess Mobile and Mint Mobile, of course, don't carry these same political ties. And the wireless plans offered by both boast less expensive offerings.",
      "T-Mobile-owned Mint advertises \u201cflexible, buy-in-bulk\u201d plans that range from $15 to $30 a month. Each option includes unlimited talk and text nationwide, but vary depending on plan length and data amount. Mint, founded in 2016, says it started \u201cbecause we\u2019d had enough of the wireless industry\u2019s games\u201d \u2014 and promises to help consumers avoid hidden fees.",
      "SmartLess Mobile's plans also start at $15 a month. Depending on the data amount purchased, that base fee can rise to $30 \u2014 but all of its plans similarly offer unlimited talk and text using T-Mobile's network. When launching last week, SmartLess underlined that its goal is to help people stop paying for the data they don't use, noting that the majority of data used by consumers today happens over Wi-Fi.",
      "\u201cSeriously, if your phone bill knew how often you\u2019re on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed,\" Hayes said in a statement for SmartLess Mobile's June 10 launch.",
      "MVNOs have proven to be attractive acquisitions to big wireless carriers over the years. But whether or not the star factor promises significant demand has yet to be seen for the market's most recent entrants.",
      "For the more established Mint Mobile, Reynolds' investment is a success story. The 25% stake that the actor reportedly owned in 2023, when the company announced that it would be acquired by T-Mobile, was estimated to give him a personal windfall of over $300 million in cash and stock. And since that deal closed, Reynolds has remained in his creative role for Mint and as the face of many campaigns \u2014 helping the brand continue to attract new customers.",
      "It's no surprise that the potential of such business returns might attract other celebrities to make similar investments, Bentzin notes. Still, newer ventures are untested. And \"as the market becomes more crowded, it could be harder and harder to pick off individual consumers,\u201d he added.",
      "Beyond a high-profile name, quality of service and what consumers can afford is also critical.",
      "\u201cThe competition battleground here is brand and price,\u201d Bentzin said.",
      "Still, if the marketing is right and product meets consumer needs, experts like Garcia Granados note that MVNOs can be a profitable business, for both the brands that start them and the telecommunications giants \u2014 like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T \u2014 offering this \u201cwholesale\u201d access to their infrastructure.",
      "As a result, he said, such high-profile ventures become \u201ca catalyst for others to follow.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Honda is recalling more than 259,000 of its cars across the U.S. due to a problem that can cause the brake pedal to shift out of position, potentially interfering with a driver's ability to stop or slow down.",
      "According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall covers certain Honda Pilots between model years 2023 and 2025 \u2014 as well cars under the auto maker's luxury Acura brand: 2021-2025 Acura TLX and 2023-2025 Acura MDX vehicles.",
      "The NHTSA's recall report notes that the brake pedal pivot pin in some of these vehicles was not secured properly during production. That can lead the pedal to shift out of place and \u201cmay lead to unintended application,\u201d the report notes, increasing crash risks.",
      "\u201cThe issue could also cause an abnormal brake pedal feeling during operation, illuminate the brake malfunction light in the instrument cluster, or cause the vehicle\u2019s brake lights to remain lit even when the brake pedal is not applied,\u201d America Honda said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "As a remedy, Honda says authorized dealers will inspect the vehicles covered by this recall and replace the brake pedal assembly if necessary, free of charge. Per the NHTSA's report, the company estimates 1% of these vehicles have this issue.",
      "Dealer notifications began on June 13. And mailed owner notification letters are set to follow on July 28. In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Honda's recall lookup.",
      "Between February 2024 and June 5, the NHSTA notes, Honda received three warranty claims related to this issue \u2014 but no reports of injuries.",
      "Honda began investigating the faulty brake pedal in April 2024, after receiving a report of a vehicle experiencing this issue. The company later determined that improper assembly of the brake pedal pivot pin occurred at a supplier's U.S. plant, which has since been closed. Production was transferred to a plant in Mexico \u2014 where the supplier now uses a camera sensor \u201cto verify whether the pivot pin is staked,\" the recall report notes.",

      "Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C. are suing in federal court to challenge President Donald Trump\u2019s Day One executive order halting leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.",
      "Judge William G. Young said during a hearing that he plans to allow the case to proceed against Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, but will dismiss the action against Trump and cabinet secretaries other than Burgum named as defendants.",
      "He said he thinks states do have standing to sue, which the federal government had argued against. The states can proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution, Young said.",
      "Young said his rulings from the bench were tentative and reserved the right to alter them in writing his formal opinion.",
      "The coalition of attorneys general sued to ask that a judge declare the executive order unlawful and approve an injunction to stop federal agencies from implementing it. They argued that Trump doesn't have the authority to halt project permitting and doing so jeopardizes the states' economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "The government is arguing that the states' claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the bounds of the federal court's jurisdiction. Department of Justice Attorney Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn't halt it, while the Interior secretary reviews the environmental impact and that this effort is underway. He said states have not shown that they were harmed by a specific permit not being issued.",
      "Turner Smith, from the Massachusetts attorney general's office, countered that the government has provided no end date and that Trump's order imposes a \u201ccategorical and indefinite halt.\" She said states have been harmed and pointed to a offshore wind project for Massachusetts, now pushed back by two years because its three outstanding permits are delayed due to the wind order. She said Massachusetts can't meet its targets for procuring offshore wind energy without the SouthCoast wind project.",
      "Wind is the U.S.' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.",
      "Trump prioritizes fossil fuels and said last week that his administration would not approve wind energy projects except in cases of emergency. The administration had ordered a Norwegian company, Equinor, to halt construction on a fully permitted offshore wind project in New York, though Equinor has been allowed to resume work.",
      "The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C.",

      "MCCLEAN, Va. -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage eased for the third week in a row, a welcome trend for prospective homebuyers at a time when elevated borrowing costs remain a drag on the housing market.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.81% from 6.84% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.87%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate eased to 5.96% from 5.97% last week. A year ago, it was 6.13%, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.35% at midday Wednesday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "With the latest decline, the average rate is now back to where it was in mid-May, reflecting a recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. Sales remain weak this year, most recently dampening the spring homebuying season.",

      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",

      "Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma, said it's understandable that people have missed payments because of the mixed messages around student loans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really at a moment of enormous empathy for the consumer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it's critical to make a plan.\"",

      "Though payments technically resumed in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024. Last month, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 1 in 4 people with federal student loans were more than 90 days behind on payments at the end of March.",
      "Here's what you should keep in mind:",

      "\u2014 Current unpaid debt",
      "\u2014 How much of your available credit you\u2019re using (also known as credit utilization)",

      "Other companies such as NerdWallet, Credit Karma and WalletHub also offer the service.",
      "A score of 670 or higher is considered \u201cgood.\u201d If your credit score is over 750, that's considered \u201cgreat.\u201d",
      "\u201cFair\u201d credit scores are in the 580-669 range, and a score below 580 is considered \u201cpoor.\u201d",
      "In the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The study's authors attribute those changes to loans falling into delinquency, or 90 days or more of nonpayment, which is then reported to credit bureaus.",
      "To avoid those consequences, or to improve your score, the simplest steps include paying at least the monthly minimum payment and setting up auto-pay to make sure payments are never late.",
      "Alev says that it's worthwhile to get into the habit of regularly checking your score, so that you're never surprised by any changes, and you can dispute any errors or negative dips.",
      "\u201cIt's important to monitor for mistakes you need to dispute,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you've only missed one payment, or it's your first time missing a payment, you can often call and ask for forgiveness because of a history of solid payments.\u201d",
      "Many borrowers reported that they never received notice from the Department of Education that their student loan payments were resuming, even though they were meant to have been notified at least three weeks in advance. Monitoring your credit score regularly means you can catch any changes before it\u2019s too late to correct significant hits.",
      "Maintaining a steady, low credit usage, known as credit utilization, is another straightforward way to improve your score, Alev said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a confusing term, but credit usage is key,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially what percentage of your available credit you\u2019re currently using. If you have a $10,000 credit limit each month, and you use $2,000, that\u2019s a 20% credit utilization. An easy rules of thumb to remember is to keep your utilization below 30%. That\u2019s where you see the score impact accelerate.\u201d",
      "Checking your credit score doesn't lower it unless you're making a \u201c hard inquiry,\u201d which is only done when requesting a line of credit.",
      "Soft inquiries, which just let you know your current score, don't affect your score.",
      "When you do apply for a line of credit such as for a mortgage or a car loan, lenders do make \u201chard inquiries,\u201d which appear on your report and can affect your credit.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said Wednesday they have finalized their \u201chistoric partnership,\u201d a year-and-a-half after the Japanese company first proposed its deal to buy the iconic American steelmaker for nearly $15 billion.",
      "The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, delaying the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it. It also forced Nippon Steel to expand the deal, including adding a so-called \u201cgolden share\u201d provision that gives the federal government a say in some matters.",
      "\u201cTogether, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel will be a world-leading steelmaker, with best-in-class technologies and manufacturing capabilities,\u201d the companies said.",
      "The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel's top-notch technology to U.S. Steel's antiquated steelmaking processes. In exchange, Nippon Steel gets access to a robust U.S. steel market, strengthened in recent years by tariffs under President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, analysts say.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not list the full terms of the deal, and did not release a national security agreement struck with Trump's administration.",
      "But in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and \u201cconsent rights\u201d on specific matters. Those include reductions in Nippon Steel's capital commitments in the national security agreement, closing or idling of U.S. Steel\u2019s existing domestic facilities and changing U. S. Steel\u2019s name and headquarters.",
      "Nippon Steel announced in December 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the U.S. Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters.",
      "The United Steelworkers union, which represents some U.S. Steel employees, opposed the deal, and Biden and Trump both vowed from the campaign trail to block it.",
      "Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "After he was elected, Trump changed course and expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That\u2019s when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.",

    "story": [
      "On a former military base in Galena, Alaska, a school that houses about 200 high school students teaches sustainability among many things",
      "GALENA, Alaska -- Eric Huntington built his dream cabin nestled in the wilderness of central Alaska, eventually raising two daughters there. But over the years, he learned that living in this quiet, remote village came with a hefty cost.",
      "Every year, the Huntington family spent about $7,000 on diesel to heat the cabin during bone-chilling winters, and a few years back, a power outage at the town's diesel plant left residents freezing in minus 50 F (about minus 45 C). When power finally returned hours later, water pipes had frozen, leaving about two dozen homes without running water for days.",
      "\"We just didn\u2019t open our door all morning until the lights came back on,\u201d said Huntington, a member of the local Louden Tribe.",
      "In Galena, a sprawling village of 400 people on the banks of the Yukon River, a community built around a former military base is shifting to clean energy in an effort to reduce its reliance on expensive, imported diesel. Local leaders say their nearly completed solar farm, along with an existing biomass plant, will boost the town's savings and protect residents from blackouts during extreme weather. The technology has the potential to provide clean backup power in emergencies and improve the power grid's resiliency, all while diversifying the village's energy sources and providing job opportunities for locals.",
      "The projects come at a precarious time for renewable energy transition in the United States. The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars of clean energy grants in an effort to bolster fossil fuel production, and billions more in investments have been scrapped or delayed this year. So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been impacted, but local leaders know the risk remains. Whatever the future of public funding, the village is an example of how renewable energies can save costs, boost reliability during extreme weather and create jobs.",
      "Once online, the solar array will ensure that the village\u2019s power grid has a backup system, said Tim Kalke, general manager of Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska \u2014 or SEGA \u2014 a nonprofit that will operate it. So when the power goes out, it doesn\u2019t result in tens of thousands of dollars in repairs, he added, and heat is guaranteed in times of extreme cold.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with life, health and safety,\u201d he said.",
      "In May, dozens of high school students in navy blue caps and gowns stood with nervous excitement in a locker-brimmed hallway, each waiting their turn to walk through yellow tinsel into a packed auditorium. It was graduation day for Galena Interior Learning Academy.",
      "The school's vocational training courses and cultural offerings attract some 200 students annually from across Alaska, boosting the village's population and energy needs.",
      "Students here can take classes on sustainable energy, aviation, carpentry and much more. But in order to keep it running \u2014 especially during long, cold winters \u2014 it needs heat.",
      "That's where the biomass project comes in. Every winter since 2016, trees (mostly paper birch) are locally harvested and shredded into wood chips that fuel a large boiler plant on campus, offsetting about 100,000 gallons (about 380,000 liters) of diesel annually for the school district and the city, said Brad Scotton, a Galena City Council member who also serves on SEGA's board. It's notable as one of the state's first large-scale biomass plants and is the most rural, he added.",
      "Cost savings from using biomass has allowed the Galena City School District to hire certified professionals in trade jobs and do upkeep on campus facilities, said district superintendent Jason R. Johnson in an email.",
      "It's also created a local workforce and a job base the village never used to have. \u201cIt's keeping the money that used to go outside within the community and providing pretty meaningful jobs for people,\" Scotton said.",
      "In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in. Galena burns just under 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of diesel annually to produce electricity, and an energy price hike around 2008 helped the village realize something needed to change. Scotton remembered when a gallon of diesel was $1.64 and then skyrocketed to $4.58 another year. At that wholesale price, the city was paying more than $1.8 million to keep the lights on.",
      "\u201cIt was really quite a shock to everybody\u2019s system in terms of trying to operate with those elevated costs,\u201d said Scotton. \u201cSo that really got the community assessing whether or not we could continue business as usual with that reliance.\u201d That's when they started looking for grants to build a solar array.",
      "On an overcast May day, on a field flanked by boreal forests, workers in reflective safety vests slotted rectangular panels on a metal grid. They were working on the nearly-completed, 1.5 megawatt solar farm that will connect to a battery system.",
      "Once in use, the community will be able to turn off its diesel engines and run on 100% clean, renewable energy on sunny summer days, and any excess power will be battery stored for nights, emergencies or heating the local indoor pool. The solar array will allow them to shut off the diesel operation between 800 to 1,000 hours a year, totaling about 100,000 gallons (about 380,000 liters).",
      "The solar farm won\u2019t necessarily lower people\u2019s electricity bills. But like the biomass plant, the hope is that it will stabilize energy costs, allowing those savings to go back into the community, all while providing work opportunities for residents like Aaren Sommer.",
      "Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy. Now he's helping to install the solar array. \u201cThat\u2019s going to reduce the diesel usage a whole bunch over at the power plant, which is going to help us out,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to the solar farm and biomass project, the Louden Tribe is building new energy-efficient homes that will help members be less reliant on diesel. Some of the siding used in the homes comes from wood harvested in the area.",
      "In November, the Huntington family moved into a new, stilted house with a solar-compatible roof, 13-inch (33-centimeter) walls and 18 inches (46 centimeters) of insulation to keep the cold at bay. When they lived in the cabin, the $7,000 a year Huntington spent on diesel was a good chunk of his annual income.",
      "The new home's energy-efficient features are already saving them money. The 300-gallon (1,130-liter) diesel tank Huntington filled before moving cost him about $2,400. Six months later, he still has unused fuel in the tank.",
      "The Huntingtons are one of eight families the tribe has moved into sustainable homes, and they plan to turn over the keys to three more this year.",
      "Kalke, SEGA's general manager, is often asked what Galena produces. He used to just say education.",
      "\"But since 2016 you can say education and wood chips. And soon, solar energy,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dipped to 245,000 last week, hovering at historically low levels, the Labor Department said Wednesday.",
      "U.S. jobless claims ticked down from 250,000 the week before. Economists had expected last week's claims to match that at 250,000.",
      "The four-week average of claims, which smooths out week-to-week volatility, rose to 245,500, the highest since August 2023.",
      "The number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits the week of June 7 slid to 1.95 million.",
      "Weekly unemployment claim are a proxy for layoffs and mostly have stayed within a healthy band of 200,000 to 250,000 since the economy recovered from a brief but painful COVID-19 recession in 2020, which temporarily wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "In recent weeks, however, claims have stayed at the high end of range, adding to evidence that U.S. job market is decelerating after years of strong hiring. So far this year, employers are adding a decent but far from spectacular 124,000 jobs a month, down from an average 168,000 last year and an average of nearly 400,000 from 2021 through 2023.",
      "The hiring slowdown is partly the drawn-out result of 11 interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2022 and 2023. But Trump\u2019s aggressive and often-erratic trade policies \u2014 including 10% taxes on imports from almost every country on earth \u2014 are also weighing on the economy, paralyzing businesses and worrying consumers who fear they\u2019ll mean higher prices.",
      "Carl Weinberg of High Frequency Economics is worried that claims remain elevated compared with recent years, when employment has remained very low by historical standards.",
      "\u201cWe believe firms have been \u2018hoarding\u2019 workers to ensure that they don\u2019t lay off skilled and trained workers by mistake, especially with the labor market still very close to full employment,\u201d Weinberg wrote. \"With uncertainty still high ... companies have remained hesitant about layoffs. That may be changing.''",
      "The Fed, satisfied that an inflation was coming down, cut rates three times last year. But the central bank has turned cautious in 2025, worried that Trump\u2019s tariffs will rekindle inflationary pressures. The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged as it wraps up a two-day meeting Wednesday.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan's exports fell in May as shipments of autos to the U.S. dropped nearly 25% from a year earlier due to higher tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "Exports fell 1.7% year-on-year, which was less than the decline analysts had forecast, the Finance Ministry reported Wednesday. Imports sank 7.7%, reflecting weakening domestic demand and worse than the 2% fall recorded in April.",
      "The trade deficit in May was 637.6 billion yen, or $4.4 billion.",
      "Japan has yet to reach a deal with Trump on resolving the tariffs issue, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba saying after he met with the U.S. president at the Group of Seven summit in Canada earlier this week that the two sides were unable to agree on some points.",
      "Trump has imposed a 25% additional tariff on Japanese autos and a 24% tariff on other goods. He recently said the auto tariff may become even higher.",
      "Ishiba has emphasized that Japan is an important ally in a key bilateral defense alliance with Washington and that he is pushing to protect his own country's national interests.",
      "The auto industry is a pillar of Japan\u2019s economy, and Japan exports more than a million vehicles to the U.S. a year. Tokyo has repeatedly stressed that automakers like Toyota and Honda produce cars in North America, contributing to the economy and creating jobs.",

      "In Gaza and Africa, U.S. contracting firms led by former American intelligence and military officers are taking on aid delivery in conflict zones",
      "ON A PLANE OVER UPPER NILE STATE, South Sudan -- Swooping low over the banks of a Nile River tributary, an aid flight run by retired American military officers released a stream of food-stuffed sacks over a town emptied by fighting in South Sudan, a country wracked by conflict.",
      "Last week's air drop was the latest in a controversial development \u2014 private contracting firms led by former U.S. intelligence officers and military veterans delivering aid to some of the world's deadliest conflict zones, in operations organized with governments that are combatants in the conflicts.",
      "The moves are roiling the global aid community, which warns of a more militarized, politicized and profit-seeking trend that could allow governments or combatants to use life-saving aid to control hungry civilian populations and advance war aims.",
      "In South Sudan and Gaza, two for-profit U.S. companies led by American national security veterans are delivering aid in operations backed by the South Sudanese and Israeli governments.",
      "The American contractors say they're putting their security, logistics and intelligence skills to work in relief operations. Fogbow, the U.S. company that carried out last week's air drops over South Sudan, says it aims to be a \u201chumanitarian\u201d force.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve worked for careers, collectively, in conflict zones. And we know how to essentially make very difficult situations work,\u201d said Fogbow President Michael Mulroy, a retired CIA officer and former senior defense official in the first Trump administration, speaking on the airport tarmac in Juba, South Sudan's capital.",
      "But the U.N. and many leading non-profit groups say U.S. contracting firms are stepping into aid distribution with little transparency or humanitarian experience, and, crucially, without commitment to humanitarian principles of neutrality and operational independence in war zones.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned over the years of successes and failures is there\u2019s a difference between a logistics operation and a security operation, and a humanitarian operation,\u201d said Scott Paul, a director at Oxfam America.",
      "\u201c\u2018Truck and chuck\u2019 doesn\u2019t help people,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt puts people at risk.\u201d",
      "Fogbow took journalists up in a cargo plane to watch their team drop 16 tons of beans, corn and salt for South Sudan's Upper Nile state town of Nasir.",
      "Residents fled homes there after fighting erupted in March between the government and opposition groups.",
      "Mulroy acknowledged the controversy over Fogbow's aid drops, which he said were paid for by the South Sudanese government.",
      "But, he maintained: \u201cWe don\u2019t want to replace any entity\u201d in aid work.",
      "Fogbow was in the spotlight last year for its proposal to use barges to bring aid to Gaza, where Israeli restrictions were blocking overland deliveries. The United States focused instead on a U.S. military effort to land aid via a temporary pier.",
      "Since then, Fogbow has carried out aid drops in Sudan and South Sudan, east African nations where wars have created some of the world's gravest humanitarian crises.",
      "Fogbow says ex-humanitarian officials are also involved, including former U.N. World Food Program head David Beasley, who is a senior adviser.",
      "Operating in Gaza, meanwhile, Safe Reach Solutions, led by a former CIA officer and other retired U.S. security officers, has partnered with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed nonprofit that Israel says is the linchpin of a new aid system to wrest control from the U.N., which Israel says has been infiltrated by Hamas, and other humanitarian groups.",
      "Starting in late May, the American-led operation in Gaza has distributed food at fixed sites in southern Gaza, in line with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's stated plan to use aid to concentrate the territory's more than 2 million people in the south, freeing Israel to fight Hamas elsewhere. Aid workers fear it's a step toward another of Netanyahu\u2019s public goals, removing Palestinians from Gaza in \u201cvoluntary\u201d migrations.",
      "Since then, several hundred Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded in near daily shootings as they tried to reach aid sites, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Witnesses say Israeli troops regularly fire heavy barrages toward the crowds in an attempt to control them.",
      "The Israeli military has denied firing on civilians. It says it fired warning shots in several instances, and fired directly at a few \u201csuspects\u201d who ignored warnings and approached its forces.",
      "It\u2019s unclear who is funding the new operation in Gaza. No donor has come forward, and the U.S. says it\u2019s not funding it.",
      "In response to criticism over its Gaza aid deliveries, Safe Reach Solutions said it has former aid workers on its team with \u201cdecades of experience in the world\u2019s most complex environments\u201d who bring \"expertise to the table, along with logisticians and other experts.\u201c",
      "Last week's air drop over South Sudan went without incident, despite fighting nearby. A white cross marked the drop zone. Only a few people could be seen. Fogbow contractors said there were more newly returned townspeople on previous drops.",
      "Fogbow acknowledges glitches in mastering aid drops, including one last year in Sudan\u2019s South Kordofan region that ended up with too-thinly-wrapped grain sacks split open on the ground.",
      "After gaining independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan has struggled to emerge from a civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people. Rights groups say its government is one of the world\u2019s most corrupt, and until now has invested little in quelling the dire humanitarian crisis.",
      "South Sudan said it engaged Fogbow for air drops partly because of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cuts in U.S. Agency for International Development funding. Humanitarian Minister Albino Akol Atak said the drops will expand to help people in need throughout the country.",
      "But two South Sudanese groups question the government's motives.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to see a humanitarian space being abused by military actors ... under the cover of a food drop,\" said Edmund Yakani, head of the Community Empowerment for Progress Organization, a local civil society group.",
      "Asked about suspicions the aid drops were helping South Sudan's military aims, Fogbow's Mulroy said the group has worked with the U.N. World Food Program to make sure \u201cthis aid is going to civilians.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it wasn't going to civilians, we would hope that we would get that feedback, and we would cease and desist,\u201d Mulroy said.",
      "In a statement, WFP country director Mary-Ellen McGroarty said: \u201cWFP is not involved in the planning, targeting or distribution of food air-dropped\u201d by Fogbow on behalf of South Sudan's government, citing humanitarian principles.",
      "Longtime humanitarian leaders and analysts are troubled by what they see as a teaming up of warring governments and for-profit contractors in aid distribution.",
      "When one side in a conflict decides where and how aid is handed out, and who gets it, \u201cit will always result in some communities getting preferential treatment,\u201d said Jan Egeland, executive director of the Norwegian Refugee Council.",
      "Sometimes, that set-up will advance strategic aims, as with Netanyahu's plans to move Gaza's civilians south, Egeland said.",
      "The involvement of soldiers and security workers, he added, can make it too \u201cintimidating\u201d for some in need to even try to get aid.",
      "Until now, Western donors always understood those risks, Egeland said. But pointing to the Trump administration's backing of the new aid system in Gaza, he asked: \u201cWhy does the U.S. ... want to support what they have resisted with every other war zone for two generations?\u201d",
      "Mark Millar, who has advised the U.N. and Britain on humanitarian matters in South Sudan and elsewhere, said involving private military contractors risks undermining the distinction between humanitarian assistance and armed conflict.",
      "Private military contractors \u201chave even less sympathy for a humanitarian perspective that complicates their business-driven model,\" he said. \u201cAnd once let loose, they seem to be even less accountable.\u201d",

      "A judge is being asked to clear the way for local governments and individual victims to vote on OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma\u2019s plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "All 50 U.S. states have agreed to the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma \u2019s latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids.",
      "A judge on Wednesday is being asked to clear the way for local governments and individual victims to vote on it.",
      "Government entities, emergency room doctors, insurers, families of children born into withdrawal from the powerful prescription painkiller, individual victims and their families and others would have until Sept. 30 to vote on whether to accept the deal, which calls for members of the Sackler family who own the company to pay up to $7 billion over 15 years.",
      "If approved, the settlement would be among the largest in a wave of lawsuits over the past decade as governments and others sought to hold drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies accountable for the opioid epidemic that started rising in the years after OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The other settlements together are worth about $50 billion, and most of the money is to be used to combat the crisis.",
      "In the early 2000s, most opioid deaths were linked to prescription drugs, including OxyContin. Since then, heroin and then illicitly produced fentanyl became the biggest killers. In some years, the class of drugs was linked to more than 80,000 deaths, but that number dropped sharply last year.",
      "The request of U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Sean Lane comes about a year after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous version of Purdue\u2019s proposed settlement. The court found it was improper that the earlier iteration would have protected members of the Sackler family from lawsuits over opioids, even though they themselves were not filing for bankruptcy protection.",
      "Under the reworked plan hammered out with lawyers for state and local governments and others, groups that don\u2019t opt in to the settlement would still have the right to sue members of the wealthy family whose name once adorned museum galleries around the world and programs at several prestigious U.S. universities.",
      "Under the plan, the Sackler family members would give up ownership of Purdue. They resigned from the company\u2019s board and stopped receiving distributions from its funds before the company\u2019s initial bankruptcy filing in 2019. The remaining entity would get a new name and its profits would be dedicated to battling the epidemic.",
      "Most of the money would go to state and local governments to address the nation\u2019s addiction and overdose crisis, but potentially more than $850 million would go directly to individual victims. That makes it different from the other major settlements.",
      "The payouts would not begin until after a hearing scheduled for Nov. 10, during which Lane is to be asked to approve the entire plan if enough of the affected parties agree.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s Senate on Tuesday night approved a labor bill that is expected to grant workers more overtime pay while making it harder for companies to hire employees on short-term contracts.",
      "The bill\u2019s approval comes as tensions have been increasing between the Senate and President Gustavo Petro over reforms to the economy and health system that have polarized the nation\u2019s politics and tested the separation of powers in Colombia\u2019s fragile democracy.",
      "Petro has repeatedly accused Congress of blocking his reforms and last week issued a decree that called on Colombia\u2019s elections agency, the National Registrar, to organize a referendum on labor laws.",

      "The acting chief of the country\u2019s top agency for enforcing worker rights will face questions at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday over her efforts to prioritize anti-diversity investigations while sidelining certain racial and gender discrimination ...",
      "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The acting chief of the country\u2019s top agency for enforcing worker rights will face questions at a Senate committee hearing Wednesday over her efforts to prioritize anti-diversity investigations while sidelining certain racial and gender discrimination cases and quashing protections for transgender workers.",
      "Andrea Lucas, who was first appointed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 and elevated to acting chief in January, is one of four Labor Department nominees to appear before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Her nomination to serve another five-year term as an EEOC commissioner requires Senate confirmation, though whether she stays on as chief will be up to President Donald Trump.",
      "Lucas, an outspoken critic of diversity, equity and inclusion practices and promoter of the idea that there are only two immutable sexes, has moved swiftly to enact Trump's civil rights agenda after he abruptly fired two of the EEOC's Democratic commissioners before the end of their five-year terms, an unprecedented move in the agency's 60-year history that has been challenged in a lawsuit.",
      "Lucas is prioritizing worker rights that conservatives argue have been ignored by the EEOC. That includes investigating company DEI practices, defending the rights of women to same-sex spaces and fighting anti-Christian bias in the workplace.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, chairman of the Senate committee holding the hearing, has championed many of those causes. He accused the EEOC under the Biden administration of \u201cinjecting its far-left\" agenda into the workplace, including by updating sexual harassment guidelines to warn against misgendering transgender workers and including abortion as a pregnancy-related condition under regulations for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.",
      "Democrats on the committee are likely to grill Lucas over criticism that she overstepped her authority by profoundly shifting the EEOC's direction to the whims of the president in the absence of a quorum, which commission has lacked since Trump fired the two commissioners.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a member of the committee, said she will oppose any EEOC nominations unless Trump reinstates the two fired Democratic commissioners, which she and more than 200 other Democratic senators and Congress members condemned in a letter to the president as an abuse of power.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is weaponizing the independent EEOC to serve his personal political agenda, firing commissioners without cause and warping the mission of the EEOC beyond recognition,\u201d Murray said in a statement ahead of the hearing. \u201cCommissioner Lucas is a right-wing extremist who has been in lockstep behind Trump\u2019s pro-discrimination agenda.\u201d",
      "Lucas has made clear her views of the limitations of the EEOC's autonomy. In a recent memo to employers, Lucas declared that the \u201cEEOC is an executive branch agency, not an independent agency\" that will \"fully and robustly comply\" with all executive orders. That includes two orders that Trump signed in January: one directing federal agencies to eliminate their own DEI activities and end any \u201cequity-related\u201d grants or contracts, and the other imposing a certification provision on all companies and institutions with government contracts or grant dollars to demonstrate that they don\u2019t operate DEI programs.",
      "The EEOC's new approach alarmed more than 30 civil rights groups, which sent a letter to the Senate committee demanding that Lucas face a hearing. The groups argued that the EEOC was created by Congress under 1964 Civil Rights Act to be a bipartisan agency that would function independently from the executive branch.",
      "The EEOC, the only federal agency empowered to investigate employment discrimination in the private sector, received more than 88,000 charges of workplace discrimination in fiscal year 2024. Its commissioners are appointed by the president to staggered terms, and no more than three can be from the same party. Much of the EEOC's authority is granted by Congress, including the obligation to investigate all complaints and enact regulations for implementing some laws.",
      "Under Lucas, the EEOC dropped seven of its own lawsuits on behalf of transgender or nonbinary workers. It also moved to drop a racial discrimination case on behalf of Black, Native American and multiracial job applicants after Trump ordered federal agencies to stop pursuing discrimination that falls under \u201cdisparate impact liability,\u201d which aims to identify practices that systematically exclude certain demographic groups.",
      "Instead, Lucas has turned the EEOC's attention to investigating company DEI practices. In her most high profile move, she sent letters to 20 law firms demanding information about diversity fellowships and other programs she claimed could be evidence of discriminatory practices.",
      "Lucas has also repeatedly encouraged workers nationwide to come forward with DEI complaints. She launched a hotline for whistleblowers and said workers should be encouraged to report bad DEI practices after a Supreme Court decision made it easier for white and other non-minority workers to bring reverse-discrimination lawsuits.",

      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is lifting a curfew in downtown Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Downtown Los Angeles businesses hoped customers would return quickly after Mayor Karen Bass lifted a curfew she had imposed last week to prevent vandalism and break-ins during nighttime protests against President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The protests, which have been largely concentrated in a few blocks of downtown where federal and local government buildings are, were in response to Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in the city and subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines.",
      "The curfew set in place June 10 provided \u201csuccessful crime prevention and suppression efforts\" and protected stores, restaurants, businesses and residents, the Democratic mayor said Tuesday. It covered a relatively tiny slice of the sprawling city.",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, the impact of days of protests could be seen in the boarded-up windows lining the streets of Little Tokyo, a historical Japanese American district right next to a federal detention building still heavily guarded by military troops.",
      "A steady stream of tourists stopped in the neighborhood to take photos of baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani wearing Dodgers blue in a massive mural on the side of a hotel.",
      "Don Tahara, the owner of Far Bar, said businesses in the area have been hit hard with vandalism and some break-ins.",
      "On June 8, thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to Trump\u2019s deployment of the Guard, blocking off a major freeway as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire.",
      "A day later, police officers used flash bangs and shot projectiles as they pushed protesters through Little Tokyo, where bystanders and restaurant workers rushed to get out of their way. Some protesters set off fireworks and threw water bottles at the officers, yelling, \u201cShame!\u201d",
      "But Tahara, a third-generation Japanese American immigrant, said he also understands why the protests were necessary, seeing similarities between the current administration's immigration raids and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.",
      "\u201cThe problems that Little Tokyo had 75 years ago was basically the federal government coming in and imprisoning all of them in concentration camps,\u201d Tahara said. \u201cThey were uprooted from their homes and businesses, their churches ... we're seeing a repeat of that.\u201d",
      "Since people assumed the curfew would still be in place Tuesday, Far Bar has still had many cancellations of reservations and events. They decided to open earlier for lunchtime in the past few days, but employees have lost hours from their paychecks. Combined with the lingering effects of the LA wildfires earlier this year, tariff-induced price increases and other increased costs, it has been a challenging climate for businesses to navigate, Tahara said.",
      "On Monday, Bass trimmed back curfew hours from beginning at 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. after a drop in arrests in the area. Bass faulted a relatively small group of \u201cbad actors who do not care about the immigrant community,\u201d a nod to thousands of protesters who exercised their rights peacefully. Trump directed federal immigration officials Sunday to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after a weekend of large protests all across the country against his administration.",
      "Cindy Reyes, head server at Rakkan Ramen, said they completely shut down the shop for Saturday's protests and closed early on Sunday. The curfew was especially difficult for their night-shift workers because the ramen joint is usually open until midnight.",
      "\u201cDinner shift makes the most money because we're the last restaurant standing so people come to us in the end,\u201d she said.",
      "The Historic Core district of downtown LA, further away from where the protests have occurred and home to many nightclubs and bars, has also suffered from break-ins. Many closed down for the duration of the curfew because the bulk of their business happens in the evening.",
      "Rhythm Room owner Vincent Vong said the weeklong closure cost him tens of thousands of dollars not just from the loss of business but also because he had to keep paying his employees.",
      "\u201cI have to schedule people to come in because I need to get them paid somehow,\u201d he said.",
      "He wished there was more support from the city and deployment of law enforcement resources to protecting the \u201cmost vulnerable areas,\u201d pointing out that his street has often been the target of vandalism and theft during large demonstrations.",
      "Even as the curfew is lifted, Vong said it will be difficult to bring customers back to an area that still has boarded-up windows and feels \u201capocalyptic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have to double down in showing that downtown LA is still a safe place to go,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tax and budget bill would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after factoring in other economic effects",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cuts package would increase deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade after including other economic effects, according to a fuller analysis of the House-passed measure released Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The report, produced by the nonpartisan CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, factors in expected debt service costs and finds that the bill would increase interest rates and boost interest payments on the baseline projection of federal debt by $441 billion.",
      "The analysis comes at a crucial moment as Trump is pushing the GOP-led Congress to act on what he calls his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\" It passed the House last month on a party-line vote, and now faces revisions in the Senate. Vice President JD Vance urged Senate Republicans during a private lunch meeting Tuesday to send the final package to the president's desk.",
      "\u201cWe're excited to get this bill out,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune afterward.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report uses dynamic analysis by estimating the budgetary impact of the tax bill by considering how changes in the economy might affect revenues and spending. This is in contrast to static scoring, which presumes all other economic factors stay constant.",
      "The CBO released its static scoring analysis earlier this month, estimating that Trump\u2019s bill would unleash trillions in tax cuts and slash spending, but also increase deficits by $2.4 trillion over the decade and leave some 10.9 million more people without health insurance.",
      "Republicans have repeatedly argued that a more dynamic scoring model would more accurately show how cutting taxes would spur economic growth \u2014 essentially overcoming any lost revenue to the federal government.",
      "But the larger deficit numbers in the new analysis gave Democrats, who are unified against the big bill, fresh arguments for challenging the GOP position that the tax cuts would essentially pay for themselves.",
      "\u201cThe Republican claim that this bill does not add to the debt or deficit is laughable, and the proof is in the numbers,\" said Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "\u201cThe cost of these tax giveaways for billionaires, even when considering economic growth, will add even more to the debt than we previously expected,\u201d he said.",
      "Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Tuesday on social media that considering the new dynamic analysis, \u201cIt\u2019s not only not paying for all of itself, it\u2019s not paying for any of itself.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other Republicans have sought to discredit the CBO, saying the organization isn\u2019t giving enough credit to the economic growth the bill will create.",
      "At the Capitol, Mehmet Oz, who heads up the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and joined Vance at the GOP Senate lunch, challenged CBO's findings when asked about its estimate that the bill would leave 10.9 million more people without health care, largely from new work requirements.",
      "\u201cWhat will an American do if they\u2019re given the option of trying to get a job or an education or volunteering their community \u2014 having some engagement \u2014 or losing their Medicaid insurance coverage?\u201d Oz asked. \u201cI have more confidence in the American people than has been given to them by some of these analyzing organizations.\u201d",
      "Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee unveiled their proposal Monday for deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making Trump\u2019s tax breaks more permanent in their draft for the big bill.",
      "The Senate's version of the package also enhances Trump\u2019s proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.",
      "The proposals from Senate Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.",
      "Bessent said Tuesday that the Senate Republican proposal for the tax cuts bill \u201cwill deliver the permanence and certainty both individual taxpayers and businesses alike are looking for, driving growth and unleashing the American economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with the Senate and the House to further refine this bill and get it to President Trump\u2019s desk,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "While the House-passed bill exempted parents with dependents from the new Medicaid work requirements, the Senate\u2019s version broadened the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.",
      "The work requirements \u201cdemonstrate that you are trying your hardest to help this country be greater,\u201d Oz said. \u201cBy doing that, you earn the right to be on Medicaid.\u201d",
      "The CBO separately released another analysis on the tax bill last week, including a look at how the measure would affect households based on income distribution. It estimates the bill would cost the poorest Americans roughly $1,600 a year while increasing the income of the wealthiest households by an average of $12,000 annually.",

      "A federal court in Argentina has granted former Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s request to serve a six-year prison sentence for corruption at home",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- A federal court on Tuesday granted a request by former Argentine President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner to serve a six-year prison sentence for corruption at her home in Buenos Aires.",
      "Judges ruled that Fern\u00e1ndez, 72, can serve time in the apartment where she lives with her daughter and her granddaughter, citing her age and security reasons. Fern\u00e1ndez was the victim of an attempted assassination three years ago.",
      "In the ruling, obtained by The Associated Press, the court said Fern\u00e1ndez \u201cmust remain at the registered address, an obligation that she may not break except in exceptional situations.\"",
      "The court also ordered Fern\u00e1ndez be placed under the watch of an electronic surveillance device to monitor her movements.",
      "Last week, Argentina\u2019s highest court upheld Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s sentence in a ruling that permanently banned her from public office over the corruption conviction that found she had directed state contracts to a friend while she was the first lady and president.",
      "The ruling against Fern\u00e1ndez, Argentina\u2019s charismatic yet deeply divisive ex-leader, sent her supporters pouring into the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2019s capital, and blocking major highways in protest.",
      "The ruling barred Fern\u00e1ndez from running in this fall\u2019s Buenos Aires legislative election just days after she launched her campaign.",
      "On Tuesday, the court dismissed prosecutors' request that Fern\u00e1ndez serve time behind bars. Judges said that the physical integrity of the political leader \u201cwould become complex in a situation of prison confinement in coexistence with any type of prison population.\u201d",
      "Seeking to serve the sentence at home, the former president had argued that she is more than 70 years old \u2014 an extenuating circumstance taken into account by the justice system to grant the privilege.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez dominated Argentine politics for two decades and forged the country\u2019s main left-wing populist movement known as Kirchnerism \u2014 after her and her husband, former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner. She rejects the charges as politically motivated.",
      "During Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s eight years in office from 2007\u20132015, Argentina expanded cash payments to the poor and pioneered major social assistance programs. Her governments funded unbridled state spending by printing money, bringing Argentina notoriety for major budget deficits and sky-high inflation.",
      "Critics blamed Argentina\u2019s years of economic volatility on Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s policies, and outrage over successive economic crises and the country\u2019s bloated bureaucracy helped vault radical libertarian President Javier Milei to the presidency in late 2023.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez was embroiled in multiple corruption scandals during her tenure. She was convicted in 2022 of corruption in a case that centered on 51 public contracts for public works awarded to companies linked to L\u00e1zaro B\u00e1ez, a convicted construction magnate and friend of the presidential couple, at prices 20% above the standard rate in a project that cost the state tens of millions of dollars.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez has questioned the impartiality of the judges. She claimed that her defense didn\u2019t have access to much of the evidence and that it was gathered without regard to legal deadlines.",
      "Fern\u00e1ndez faces a series of other upcoming trials on corruption charges.",

      "Brazil has auctioned off several land and offshore potential oil sites near the Amazon River, aiming to expand production in untapped regions despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups",
      "BRASILANDIA, Brazil -- BRASILANDIA, Brazil (AP) \u2014 Brazil auctioned off several land and offshore potential oil sites near the Amazon River on Tuesday as it aims to expand production in untapped regions despite protests from environmental and Indigenous groups.",
      "The event came months before Brazil is to host the U.N.\u2019s first climate talks held in the Amazon. The protesters outside Tuesday's venue warned of potential risks that oil drilling poses to sensitive ecosystems and Indigenous communities in the Amazon.",
      "A luxury Rio de Janeiro hotel hosted the auction conducted by the National Oil Agency. Most of the 172 oil blocks for sale are located in areas with no current production, such as 47 offshore locations close to the mouth of the Amazon River and two sites inland in the Amazon near Indigenous territories.",
      "Nineteen offshore blocks were awarded to Chevron, ExxonMobil, Petrobras and CNPC. The oil companies see the area as highly promising because it shares geological characteristics with Guyana, where some of the largest offshore oil discoveries of the 21st century have been made.",
      "This region is considered to have high potential risk due to strong currents and the proximity to the Amazon seashore.",
      "Under public pressure from President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, known as IBAMA, approved an emergency plan allowing state-run Petrobras to conduct exploratory drilling in a block near the mouth of the Amazon River, the last step to grant an environmental license.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable and concerning that blocks are being acquired in a basin that has not yet received environmental licensing,\u201d Nicole Oliveira, executive director of the environmental nonprofit Arayara, which tried to block the auction in court.",
      "\u201cThis is an irresponsible move by the National Oil Agency and a very risky one for the companies involved,\" Oliveira told The Associated Press. \"We will continue litigating to prevent the contracts from being signed and the blocks from being explored.\u201d",
      "The auction wrapped up with only 34 oil blocks awarded.",
      "Brazil\u00b4s oil agency noted that the signing bonuses \u2014 one-time payments made by the winning companies \u2014 totaled $180 million, a record for auctions of this kind. An agency representative said the highest premium was for a block located near the mouth of the Amazon River, which drew a nearly 3,000% markup.",
      "Oliveira took part in a peaceful protest that gathered about 200 people outside the auction site, from environmentalists to Indigenous leaders.",
      "\u201cWe came to Rio to repudiate the auction,\u201d said Giovane Tapura of the Manoki, an Amazon tribe. \u201cWe would have liked to be consulted and to see studies on how the oil drilling could affect us. None of this has been done.\u201d",
      "In a recorded opening statement at the start of the event, Brazil\u2019s National Oil Agency said the auctions are part of the country\u2019s energy diversification strategy aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy and that contracts signed with the winning companies include measures to reduce carbon intensity in production activities, as well as mandatory investments in energy transition projects.",
      "Brazil has increased crude oil production, which became the country\u2019s top export for the first time last year, surpassing soybeans.",
      "The auction is part of the federal government's goal to maintain and even expand output beyond 2030, when production from current oil blocks under exploration is expected to decline. Brazil gets most of its electricity from hydropower and other green energies.",
      "The U.N. climate talks will be held in the city of Belem, close to the mouth of the Amazon. Critics say it's a contradiction that Brazil's president is pushing for increased fossil fuel production while trying to cast himself as an environmental champion.",
      "Claudio Angelo, head of international policy at Climate Observatory, a coalition of 133 environmental, civil society and academic organizations, told reporters ahead of the auction that Brazil is both undermining its own standing ahead of the climate talks and undermining climate protection efforts.",
      "\u201cThe Brazilian government is endangering everyone\u2019s future since science has been crystal clear about the need to stop the expansion of fossil fuels everywhere in the world,\" he said.",

      "Caden Bodine singled leading off and Sebastian Alexander and Blake Barthol were hit by pitches to load the bases. Walker Mitchell punched a ball into right field to bring in two runs, and then Hartman issued a four-pitch walk.",
      "Out went Hartman (2-1) and in came Jake Schweitzer. Colby Thorndyke greeted him with his second bases-clearing double in two games to make it 5-0. Thorndyke came home on Ty Dooley's one-out single and finished 3 for 4 with five RBIs.",
      "The Chanticleers padded their lead with Pete Mihos' two-run triple in the fifth and two more runs in the sixth. Coastal Carolina is 43-0 when leading after six innings.",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The Stanley Cup is a little banged up, thanks to the Florida Panthers\u2019 celebration of back-to-back titles.",
      "The bowl of the famous trophy is cracked and the bottom is dented. Not for the first time and likely not the last.",
      "The Panthers won their second consecutive championship on home ice Tuesday night, beating Edmonton in six games. The team, following decades of tradition, partied with the Cup into the wee hours and kept the revelry going in Fort Lauderdale well into Wednesday afternoon.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hockey Hall of Fame said the keepers of the Cup are taking the appropriate steps and plan to have it repaired by the celebration parade on Sunday. Made of silver and a nickel alloy, the 37-pound Cup is relatively malleable.",
      "Damage is nothing new for the 131-year-old silver chalice that has been submerged in pools and the Atlantic Ocean and mishandled by players, coaches and staff for more than a century. Just this decade alone, the Tampa Bay Lightning dropped the Cup during their boat parade in 2021 and the Colorado Avalanche dented it on the ice the night they won the following year.",

      "Difficult as it may seem, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is desperately trying to not think about what may await the Oklahoma City Thunder",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Difficult as it may seem, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is desperately trying to not think about what may await the Oklahoma City Thunder.",
      "The MVP, scoring champion and Thunder star doesn't want to think about the end of the NBA Finals. Or how the Larry O'Brien Trophy will feel in his hands if he gets to finally hoist it as a champion. Or what the celebration will look like, sound like, be like.",
      "The Thunder are one win from a title, and it could come when they visit the potentially shorthanded Indiana Pacers in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night. It is not just another game. Gilgeous-Alexander is trying to make it seem that way.",
      "\u201cThe cusp of winning is not winning,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cThe way I see it, winning is all that matters. It hasn\u2019t been fulfilled. We haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d",
      "Technically, that's true. In actuality, that's also slightly ridiculous.",
      "They lead the NBA Finals 3-2, have posted 83 wins so far this season and just found a way to hand Indiana its first set of back-to-back losses in three months. The Thunder, just as they did against Denver in Round 2, have bounced back from series deficits of 1-0 and 2-1, and are closer to a title than the franchise \u2014 at least since moving to Oklahoma City \u2014 has ever been.",
      "\u201cWe want to win the game tomorrow, but the most important thing we need to do to win the game tomorrow is prepare today and prepare tomorrow and play the first possession really well, then the next possession, then the next possession,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s how we try to approach a game, how we try to approach the playoff series, how we try to approach every single day and let that win the day.\u201d",
      "The Pacers expect a crazed atmosphere for what will be their final home game of the season; if they force a Game 7 it'll be in Oklahoma City on Sunday. What the Pacers don't know is if Tyrese Haliburton will be able to play; he's dealing with a strained right calf and his status won't be definitively known until Thursday.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s all we can do, right? Think about the next game,\u201d Pacers forward Pascal Siakam said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity in front of our fans. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a huge moment for our fans. They\u2019re going to be super excited. We have a chance at home, NBA Finals. It\u2019s a good opportunity. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d",
      "Pacers coach Rick Carlisle has been stressing two key points: fewer turnovers (Indiana had 23 for 32 Oklahoma City points in Game 5) and limiting OKC's offensive rebounding. Those areas must be cleaned up whether Haliburton plays or not.",
      "The Pacers trailed New York 3-2 in the second round last season, came home and won Game 6, then went to Madison Square Garden and won Game 7. Winning from this position is possible, and Carlisle obviously knows it.",
      "\u201cWhat we need to do is buckle down. Stand strong. I anticipate one of the best crowds in the history of Gainbridge Fieldhouse,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWe've got to find a way. The ultimate is to get to a Game 7. That is the ultimate privilege. It\u2019s the ultimate experience in sports. But we\u2019ve got to take care of home court tomorrow to do that.\u201d",
      "Thunder guard Jalen Williams, who had 40 points in Game 5, didn't get a ton of calls and texts after the highest-scoring playoff game of his career.",
      "Then again, his friends know he's not on the phone much right now.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I try not to answer my phone as much, even though that probably sounded like I\u2019m a jerk,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of highs and lows throughout the series. You don\u2019t get as many texts if you don\u2019t play well. I try to keep that in perspective, too.\u201d",
      "Since 2000, teams are 25-13 in games where they can win the NBA title.",
      "The Thunder are aiming to go 1-0 in such games this year, something 20 teams have done in the last 25 seasons. The NBA's most recent champion, Boston, needed two tries at it last season before ousting Dallas.",
      "If the Thunder win Game 6 \u2014 or Game 7 \u2014 it would push Oklahoma City's win total for the season to 84, including playoffs.",
      "And that would be rare air. Only three teams have won 84 or more games in a season: the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors won 88 (and lost the NBA Finals), the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls won 87 games, and the 1996-97 Bulls won 84.",

      "Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said Wednesday that he never seriously considered retirement after last year's loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Travis Kelce said the decision to return for his 13th season with the Kansas City Chiefs wasn't much of a decision at all.",
      "In fact, the four-time All-Pro tight end indicated Wednesday that No. 14 isn't out of the question.",
      "\u201cI got one year on this contract, I know that. And we'll try to figure out something for next year,\u201d Kelce said after the second day of the Chiefs' mandatory three-day minicamp, which was moved partially indoors because of lightning in the area.",
      "\u201cThe Chiefs organization knows how much I love them. I can't see myself playing anywhere else,\" Kelce continued. \u201cWe'll deal with (2026) down the road, when the time is right. But right now, I'm focused on winning a championship this year.\u201d",
      "The question of whether the 35-year-old would hang up his cleats was among the biggest to follow the Chiefs' lopsided loss to the Eagles in the Super Bowl. While he still played at a high level last season, Kelce's production dipped noticeably \u2014 97 catches for 823 yards and just three touchdowns for a team that won 15 regular-season games.",
      "Throw in Kelce's myriad business interests, including a successful media career thanks in part to his popular podcast, and a long-term relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, and it made sense to wonder how much longer he would play.",
      "Yet it only took a matter of weeks for Kelce to decide to chase another championship.",
      "Part of it was the way last season's run had ended. Kelce had a throwback game in the divisional round against Houston with seven catches for 117 yards, but he only had four for 39 in the 40-22 loss to the Eagles in the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cReally didn't feel like it was my last game. Just felt like I had a lot more to prove,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, you want to let the emotions die down; you don't want to make a decision off initial emotions. Once they died down, I felt like I still had that fire in my chest to come in and keep building and chase another Super Bowl, man.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs made it to the Super Bowl despite playing most of the season without their top two wide receivers, Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown, both of whom are fully healthy now after their injuries. They also made it despite massive issues at left tackle, which the Chiefs hope to have solved by drafting Ohio State standout Josh Simmons in the first round.",
      "Now, they have a motivated \u2014 and noticeably slimmer \u2014 Kelce back at tight end. There were reports that he had dropped about 25 pounds since the end of last season, though Kelce insisted that may have been an exaggeration.",
      "\u201cDon't believe all you read on the internet, guys. I'm down some weight from the end of last season \u2014 last year \u2014 but each year is different, man. You have to rebuild it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, I had some time to really focus on some form running and some things early in the offseason that I didn't have time for last year. Certainly feeling good and I think it'll pay off.\u201d",
      "Patrick Mahomes certainly hopes so. After leading one of the NFL's most productive offenses early in his career, Mahomes has struggled to get the Chiefs on track the past couple of seasons, largely because of injuries and offensive line trouble.",
      "Still, the Chiefs' star quarterback said he never put any pressure on Kelce to return for another season.",
      "\u201cI think you have in the back of your mind, for anybody that's played a lot of seasons, there's always the chance if they're going to come back and put in the work,\" Mahomes said. \u201cFor him, I think it was just recalibrating, seeing where he was at, and from what I've seen, he's ready to go. He's put in the work this offseason and he's excited to make another run at it.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs wrap up their three-day minicamp on Thursday, then break for about a month, before reuniting at Missouri Western State University for training camp. And while the thought of spending a few weeks living in college dorm rooms probably doesn't sound very enticing to Kelce, the prospect of starting another championship run there clearly drives him.",
      "\u201cI love this game. It's still my childhood dream,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cWhen I really thought about it this offseason, I got back to wanting to focus on this game and getting the most out of this game as I can, while I'm still putting on the cleats and pads. This will always be No. 1 in terms of my business world and career path.\u201d",

She set the world record mark of 4:07.64 nearly two years ago during a Diamond League meet in Monaco.",

Everything we do, we have to dream big and just believe in ourselves that we could do it.\u201d",

      "What she's doing in workouts now has already proven highly successful. She won her third straight 1,500 Olympic title in Paris last August. A month before that, she broke her own 1,500 record on the same track where she will run next Thursday.",
      "\u201cFor me, I would say being mentally strong and believing in everything I do,\u201d she said of preparing for big moments. \u201cBelieving in the training, believing in waking up to empower the next generation, believing in everything that has been from my younger time when I was running barefoot to where I am now. It has really given me that drive to wake up and go for training and just be strong.\u201d",
      "She will be wearing the latest innovations from Nike, too, from her aerodynamic track suit to her spikes. Should she break the mark, it would be subject to ratification by World Athletics.",
      "Fellow Kenyan runner, longtime friend and training partner Eliud Kipchoge has been providing emotional support. He had an event set up for him in 2019, when he ran a marathon in 1:59:40 to break the 2-hour marathon barrier at the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Austria. The mark wasn\u2019t ratified by the sport's governing body.",
      "\u201cIt will be lovely to see Eliud after the finish line,\u201d said Kipyegon, who's a four-time world champion. \u201cI get positive messages from around the world that I can do it. ... It really motivates me a lot going on to this challenge. I know it will not be easy, but I\u2019m going to try my best and we will see what the finish line offers.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s eager for the challenge to show the next generation of female runners that anything is possible. That includes her young daughter, Alyn.",
      "\u201cYou have to dream and just be patient for it,\u201d Kipyegon said.",
      "Same with her quest next week, which she will approach in increments.",
      "\u201cYou have to dream of how will I cross the 800 mark? How will I cross that 1,200 mark?\" Kipyegon explained. \"It\u2019s the repetition of, \u2018I have to be myself and just think of how will I shed the seven seconds?\u2019",

    "story": [
      "College sports was once rooted in tradition, school pride and loyalty, but those expectations are changing in a landscape where athletes have won the ability to transfer season to season, year to year",
      "Hailey Van Lith was one year away from tying a bow on a traditional college career at Louisville and being cemented as one of the most decorated four-year starters in Cardinals history. She had just led her team to its third straight Elite Eight appearance and put up career-high numbers, including 19.7 points per game.",
      "But the rising senior from Wenatchee, Washington, had other plans. With WNBA aspirations on her mind, Van Lith swapped Louisville red for LSU purple and gold and embarked on a new journey in Baton Rouge. Her lone season included another run to the Elite Eight and it was back to the transfer portal.",
      "Coach Mark Campbell\u2019s pro-style offense caught her eye, and she decided her fifth and final year of eligibility would be spent at TCU.",
      "College sports was once rooted in tradition, school pride and loyalty, but those expectations are changing if not fading in a landscape where athletes have won the ability to transfer season to season, year to year. Some are painted as disloyal or selfish but Van Lith and others don't see it that way.",
      "\u201cWhenever you transfer, you always expect pushback,\u201d Van Lith told The Associated Press. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many podcasts I\u2019ve seen on people discussing my choices to go to this school and that school, and the theories that are thrown out there are all wrong. But it\u2019s just, you learn to live in harmony with that, and at the end of the day, I just decided I\u2019m no longer going to let false assumptions disrupt my peace.\u201d",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions, Van Lith said, is that her transfer decisions were guided by NIL compensation. She was able to look past accusations of being a \u201cmoney chaser\u201d or a \u201ctrophy chaser\u201d and find solace knowing onlookers didn\u2019t have the full picture.",
      "\u201cMultiple of the schools that I went to, I actually never got a check from,\" she said. \"I think that in transfer culture now, a lot of people automatically assume that it has to do with the collective money or now I guess it\u2019s revenue share. But it just depends on the person, and for me, it was all basketball decisions.\u201d",
      "Ann Skeet, senior director of Leadership Ethics at Santa Clara\u2019s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said all parties should be held to the same standards. Coaches and athletic directors take new jobs, navigating buyouts and ill will along the way.",
      "\u201cI do think one of the realities of sport in this day and age is that people are making changes more often than they used to,\u201d Skeet said. \u201cHow they communicate what their decision is, how much time they give people, how frequently they\u2019re changing teams, all of those things should be considered, and I think it\u2019s fair to hold the coaches and players to equal standards.\u201d",
      "Skeet acknowledged the pressure on athletes navigating a new, professional-like industry at a young age. Millions of dollars in name, image and likeness compensation is already flowing even before schools start cutting checks after July 1 under the NCAA antitrust settlement.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, NIL is bringing market pressures to college sports in a way that we haven\u2019t experienced before, and so players are having to trade off and think about what serves their own personal interests vs. what serves the team interests in ways that they haven\u2019t had to consider in the past,\" she said.",
      "While Van Lith was deciding her future, running back Ray Davis was awaiting his. In his sole season at Kentucky, Davis rushed for 1,129 yards on 199 carries and led the SEC with 21 touchdowns from scrimmage. His production was enough to garner interest from NFL scouts.",
      "Similar to Van Lith, Davis\u2019s winding road to the pros involved several stops. Before Kentucky, he had two-year stints at Temple (2019-2021) and Vanderbilt (2021-2023). Transferring to Kentucky meant Davis would suit up for his third team in five years, and he knew moving from one SEC school to the next could stir the pot. The decision wasn\u2019t an easy one.",
      "\u201cIt was super difficult,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt took days, literally almost weeks to just really make a decision. And when I made the decision, I just had to live with it. I couldn\u2019t think twice about it. I had to be confident.\u201d",
      "The move paid off. Davis gained national attention and was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 2024 draft. But while his draft stock soared, the backlash from transferring a second time took a toll.",
      "\u201cMentally it sucks because, you know, as a kid when you\u2019re 18, 19 or whatever, you\u2019re being told, \u2018Hey he\u2019s leaving because he\u2019s disloyal,\u2019 and that\u2019s not what it is,\u201d Davis said.",
      "He focused on what he could control.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really about how you handle it yourself, how you internalize it yourself, and how you go about walking in the building each and every day. If you be like, `Ah, people are looking at me like I\u2019m not an honest and disloyal person,\u2019 then that\u2019s going to hurt you mentally. But if you walk into a place where you\u2019re confident in who you are, then I think you\u2019ll succeed,\u201d Davis told AP.",
      "Transfer decisions, regardless of the underlying factor, can lead to unfavorable public perceptions \u2014 or worse. A 2024 study found a cross-section of abusive content directed toward college athletes on social media.",
      "\u201cIt certainly is their right to transfer, but then they will also develop whatever reputation they develop as a result of the choices they make. So people who transfer multiple times are going to be identified in that way,\u201d Skeet said. \u201cIt goes with the territory, as they say.\u201d",
      "Both Van Lith and Davis noted the irony in receiving blowback when team personnel can seek new ventures without repercussions.",
      "\u201cCoaches leave. Directors leave. Everybody has the opportunity to leave. So for players, we\u2019ve got to have that opportunity too,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Added Van Lith: \u201cA lot of times, the loyalty is placed on the responsibility of the players, but you see coaches leave all the time to better their financial situation, to make more money, to do better for their family. When people talk about loyalty, I really challenge them to put into perspective, if they would feel the same if a coach left.\u201d",

      "Julie Vanloo\u2019s ability to communicate in four languages has been crucial as the expansion Golden State Valkyries develop chemistry and find ways to make sure everyone can understand a given play or defensive set",
      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Julie Vanloo smiled as the memory came back to her and the nursery rhyme words from her childhood became familiar again and just flowed.",
      "A short phrase in French from her days as a schoolgirl in Belgium.",
      "Vanloo\u2019s ability to communicate in multiple languages has been crucial as the expansion Golden State Valkyries develop chemistry and find ways to make sure everyone can understand a given play or defensive set.",
      "Her teammates are often in awe.",
      "Part of an international roster on the Valkyries, Vanloo\u2019s language skills have helped everybody get comfortable on a team that has been changing by the week. Vanloo, Temi F\u00e1gb\u00e9nl\u00e9 (Great Britain) and Janelle Salaun (France) are currently competing for their countries in the EuroBasket 2025 tournament.",
      "That has led to much mixing and matching for coach Natalie Nakase, who has counted on players like Vanloo making key assists on and off the court.",
      "The Valkyries (5-6) will host Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on Thursday night in their sixth home game \u2014 all of them sellouts \u2014 at Chase Center.",
      "Vanloo will miss the fanfare of that matchup as she plays for Belgium \u2014 and she'll certainly brush up on her language skills while away.",
      "For Vanloo, a commitment to building her speaking skills became as important as her basketball talent as she dreamt of reaching the WNBA. She speaks English, French, Italian and Flemish, the dialect of Dutch spoken in her home country.",
      "\u201cSlowly you step up to the next level and when we go to high school and we\u2019re 12 years old, we really start to drill it, we start to learn it, both English and French,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like six to nine hours per week we really learn English and French in Belgium. All of our series and even our cartoons are in English, we use subtitles for French so that\u2019s how we actually learned the accent and everything.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s for all the kids out there, language is important, it\u2019s an advantage. I think you are rich when you know multiple languages because it\u2019s just easy to communicate and to create a bond with people.\u201d",
      "She didn't always love it and she's not always perfect. But Vanloo has remained vigilant about learning.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to come play professionally, to come to the league one day. If I have a goal, nobody\u2019s going to stop me,\" she said. \u201cFor basketball, I was very, very motivated to learn languages.\u201d",
      "Vanloo was selected by the Valkyries from Washington in the expansion draft last December.",
      "She is one of eight non-American players on Golden State's roster representing six countries \u2014 Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.",
      "Kayla Thornton played in Korea and realizes the challenges of trying to live in a place where she doesn't speak the language. She tries to use a few words with her teammates when possible.",
      "\u201cI do pick up on some of the stuff because we do have Italians and we do have French,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cWhen I do hear it I kind of do catch on, I do know a few phrases. Most of the time they teach you their lingo, and that\u2019s the bad lingo.\u201d",
      "Vanloo's ability to share her basketball expertise and the basics takes pressure off Nakase.",
      "\u201cI think what\u2019s really helped is Julie can translate for all of them. Julie speaks everyone\u2019s language so that\u2019s kind of been really key, just how we can connect that way,\u201d Nakase said. \u201cImagine going to another country and you have no idea. When I played in Germany I really wasn\u2019t understanding but I made sure I paid attention. So it\u2019s been nice to have Julie because she\u2019s listening, she\u2019s doing extra for a teammate.\u201d",
      "Laeticia Amihere of Canada, a native French speaker who didn\u2019t make the opening game roster but has since re-signed with the team, counts on Vanloo. So does rookie guard Carla Leite, who's from France and is working to gain confidence speaking English.",
      "\u201cA lot of us speak French and a lot of us speak different languages so to be able to use that on the court to our advantage I think it\u2019s been great,\u201d Amihere said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s obviously helping out the French and the French are helping us all just work cohesively and try to find a way we can communicate easily. It\u2019s been cool hearing different languages in the locker room. I\u2019m used to it. Some people may not be used to it but I think it\u2019s dope.\u201d",
      "Kyara Linskens is also from Belgium. She can relate to Vanloo\u2019s drive to reach the WNBA and do all the little things \u2014 like learning multiple languages \u2014 to get there.",
      "\u201cI realized (the importance), because I wanted this,\u201d Vanloo said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, when I want something I\u2019m going to do it until I can\u2019t.\u201d",

      "Russian luge athletes will be banned from competing at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics even as individuals with neutral status, the sliding sport's governing body decided Wednesday.",
      "The International Luge Federation has kept Russian athletes from competing in major international luge events \u2014 such as World Cups and world championships \u2014 since the 2021-22 season in response to the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war.",
      "At a meeting of the FIL congress in Tampere, Finland, officials voted 24-7, with one invalid ballot, to extend that ban that was first put in place in 2022 and extended again in 2024. A second vote then took place on the notion of letting Russian sliders try to compete under a neutral flag at the upcoming Olympics; that was defeated 24-8.",
      "\u201cThe Congress has made its position clear,\u201d FIL president Einars Fogelis said. \u201cThis outcome reflects our collective responsibility to uphold fair and safe competition. We fully respect the diversity of views within our community, especially from our athletes.\u201d",
      "The Milan-Cortina Olympics open on Feb. 6.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation will follow luge's lead. Russian sliders have also not competed in those sports at the top international levels since the end of the 2021-22 season.",
      "Also unclear: if any Russian sleds would have had a legitimate hope of qualifying even if they were allowed to try. Without being on the circuits in more than three years, it\u2019s impossible to assess which athletes would be competitive enough to secure Olympic bids.",
      "There were 28 sliders from Russia \u2014 10 in luge, six in skeleton and 12 in bobsled \u2014 at the 2022 Beijing Games, though they competed under the Russian Olympic Committee flag and not the actual Russian flag. That was part of the sanctions levied against Russia for the state-sponsored doping scandal that overshadowed the 2014 Sochi Olympics.",
      "The Beijing Games closed four days before the attack on Ukraine started, and Russian athlete Tatyana Ivanova won a bronze medal in women's singles luge.",
      "At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Russia and military ally Belarus were excluded from team sports but athletes in individual sports could apply for neutral status to compete. A total of 32 accepted invitations from the International Olympic Committee after passing eligibility tests that included not publicly supporting the war and not having ties to military and state security agencies.",
      "The FIL reviewed the results of an anonymous polling of luge athletes who were surveyed about the prospect of letting Russian athletes resume sliding. It said the survey \u201crevealed a broad range of concerns and opinions regarding safety, Olympic quotas, anti-doping compliance, and fairness.\u201d",
      "\u201cAthletes hold a wide range of views,\u201d FIL athletes\u2019 commission chair Leon Felderer said. \u201cThere are many concerns and arguments on both sides.\u201d",

      "The head of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency told senators that Chinese swimmers would have had to eat around 11 pounds (5 kilograms) of food to test for the amounts of the performance enhancer that resulted in the much-debated positive drug tests from 2021 that were later disregarded.",
      "\u201cIt's unbelievable to think that Tinkerbell just showed up and sprinkled it all over the kitchen,\u201d Travis Tygart said in a Senate hearing Tuesday focused on the World Anti-Doping Agency's response to the doping case.",
      "A key part of that case was WADA's acceptance of the explanation from Chinese authorities that the swimmers had been contaminated by traces of the drug Trimetazidine (TMZ) in a hotel kitchen.",
      "USADA scientists analyzed data from a report commissioned by WADA to come up with the amount of food (5 kilos) or liquid (4.9 liters) the athletes would have had to have consumed to test positive at the levels they did.",
      "WADA officials declined to participate in the hearing, which spokesperson James Fitzgerald called \u201canother political effort led by Travis Tygart ... to leverage the Senate and the media in a desperate effort to relitigate the Chinese swimming cases and misinform athletes and other stakeholders.\u201d",
      "Also testiying was former U.S. drug czar, Rahul Gupta, whose decision at the start of this year to withhold $3.6 million in funding \u2014 the biggest single chunk that WADA receives on an annual basis \u2014 furthered a long-running feud between U.S. and WADA authorities.",
      "The Senate subcommittee holding the hearing is considering a bill that would give the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy \u2014 the so-called drug czar \u2014 permanent authority to withhold those funds, without needing year-to-year permission from Congress.",
      "In his prepared testimony, Gupta compared WADA's governance challenges to a used car.",
      "\u201cYou expect that the car has been thoroughly inspected, that it\u2019s safe and roadworthy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as soon as you drive it off the lot, the brakes fail and the engine sputters \u2014 and only then do you learn that the dealership has a history of skipping inspections altogether.\u201d",
      "Gupta and Tygart recommended a host of reforms for WADA, most of which revolve around ensuring independence, which they say cannot be accomplished under the current model that calls on the International Olympic Committee to supply half of WADA's money.",
      "Gupta also pressed for the United States to regain a seat on WADA's executive committee that it lost in the aftermath of the dues flareup.",
      "Also testifying was Katie McLaughlin, a member of the U.S. 4x200 freestyle team that won a silver medal at the 2021 Olympics. The Americans finished second to a Chinese team that had two swimmers whose positives were erased after WADA declined to look further into the contamination case.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating, honestly,\u201d McLaughlin said of hearing the news about the doping case. \u201cI was taken aback and heartbroken. I spent a lot of my career trusting in the powers that be, and it was really sad to find out that's someone who could not be trusted, meaning WADA.\u201d",
      "The investigator WADA hired to look into the Chinese doping case ruled that WADA had acted reasonably in not pursuing the Chinese case but still called it \u201ccurious\u201d that the agency did not further pursue facts that didn't line up with the normal handling of contamination cases.",
      "Fitzgerald, the WADA spokesperson, said the agency did, in fact, address some of the concerns in the report, especially about the way contaminations cases are handled.",
      "\u201cAs highlighted by the Chinese cases and many others, the issue of contamination is real and growing and it is crucial that WADA and its partners address it head on,\u201d he said.",
      "Tygart led off his testimony claiming the Chinese case had potentially impacted 96 medals from the 2021 and 2024 Olympics.",

      "Bangladesh piled up a mammoth 484 for nine on a rain-curtailed day 2 of the first Test in Galle against Sri Lanka",
      "GALLE, Sri Lanka -- Bangladesh rode on the broad shoulders of their veteran Mushfiqur Rahim to pile up a mammoth 484 for nine on a rain-curtailed day 2 of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.",
      "It is their fourth highest total in the longer format against Sri Lanka.",
      "On a pitch that\u2019s expected to break up, Mushfiqur dug in deep putting together a masterful 163 that lasted more than eight hours. He faced 350 deliveries, blending granite-like defense with the occasional flourish to lead the charge.",
      "The old warhorse stitched together two crucial stands that wrested the momentum away from the hosts. First came a record-breaking 264-run partnership with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who looked in sublime touch during his knock of 148. Shanto, though, fell against the run of play \u2014 lured into a false stroke by Asitha Fernando and holing out to Angelo Mathews at mid-off, a sharp catch.",
      "Undeterred, Mushfiqur then forged another valuable stand \u2014 this time worth 149 runs \u2014 with the free-spirited Litton Das, whose shot-making added zip to the innings. However, both set batters were dismissed in the space of nine deliveries just as they threatened to push Bangladesh past 500.",
      "Sri Lanka resorted to bowling a negative line, peppering the leg-side and starving the batters of scoring opportunities. It was a tactic born of desperation, but it bore fruit. Das was dismissed trying to reverse sweep debutant Tharindu Rathnayake \u2014 the top edge ballooning to the keeper.",
      "The old ball started reverse swinging and brought some late cheer for the hosts. Milan Rathnayake, the bustling right-arm seamer, picked up three wickets in a post-tea spell as Bangladesh lost five wickets for 26 runs \u2014 a collapse that gave Sri Lanka some hope.",
      "Fernando, fresh off a county stint in the UK with Glamorgan, returned three wickets as well. Though not operating at full throttle following a recent illness, he showed why he\u2019s Sri Lanka\u2019s pace spearhead, mixing up sharp bouncers with pinpoint yorkers to good effect.",
      "Rathnayake, the debutant, had three scalps to his name, but the biggest letdown was Prabath Jayasuriya. The usually reliable left-arm spinner toiled for 48 wicketless overs, finding neither bite nor bounce on a surface that usually suits him.",
      "Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s late fightback, the day \u2014 and perhaps the match \u2014 belonged to Mushfiqur. His love affair with Galle continues to bloom, with 482 runs in four innings at the venue. Only Pakistan\u2019s Younis Khan (497) and Australia\u2019s Usman Khawaja (490) have scored more at the ground among visiting batters.",
      "For a side that\u2019s beaten Sri Lanka just once in 26 previous Test attempts, Bangladesh have finally found themselves in the driver\u2019s seat. If their bowlers can now hit the right lengths and apply scoreboard pressure, they might just achieve something special in Galle.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit foreign for us to go through this for a few days,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said.",
      "New York has lost five in a row and mustered only five runs in its past six games, including a 1-0 win last Thursday in Kansas City. The last time the Yankees scored five runs or fewer in a six-game span was August 1968.",
      "In the past six games, New York is batting .164.",
      "Giancarlo Stanton is 4 for 8 in his first two games since returning from injuries to both elbows. But lineup mainstays Bellinger (.152 in his last eight games), Paul Goldschmidt (.164 in his last 17 games) and Aaron Judge (.125 in his last seven games) are all mired in extended slumps.",
      "Judge, who began the night leading the American League in all three Triple Crown categories, was booed following strikeouts in the sixth and eighth innings.",
      "Boone tinkered with his lineup \u2014 batting rookie Jasson Dom\u00ednguez first and dropping Goldschmidt to sixth \u2014 but it didn\u2019t yield results for the Yankees, who were limited to four hits and got just three runners to second base against Kyle Hendricks and a trio of relievers.",
      "Boone implored the Yankees to remain patient at the plate but acknowledged they might have been pressing Tuesday, when they went up against the soft-tossing Hendricks on an unseasonably cool 67-degree night.",
      "\u201cYou want to be the guy (to) kind of get the hit, get it going,\u201d Boone said. \u201cBut that\u2019s where the patience comes in and that\u2019s where just you can\u2019t obsess on the result. You can\u2019t go up there (like) \u2018I gotta get a hit, I gotta do this.\u2019 It\u2019s got to be, \u2018I gotta go take a tough at-bat.\u2019\u201d",
      "Even with the slump, the Yankees still rank among the top five teams in the majors in runs (370), homers (109) and OPS (.784). They finished among the top five in all three categories in five of Boone\u2019s first seven seasons as manager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a little struggle the last couple days, which unfortunately is going to happen,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIt\u2019s just always shocking to see our group not score runs, right? Especially a few days in a row now.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to focus on the little things \u2014 think small, big things come.\u201d",

      "PASADENA, Calif. -- Inter Milan was held to a 1-1 draw by Monterrey in the Club World Cup opener Tuesday night in the Italian power's first match since losing the Champions League final.",
      "Veteran Spanish star Sergio Ramos scored on a stunning first-half header for Monterrey, delighting the decidedly pro-Mexico crowd in Southern California for Monterrey coach Dom\u00e8nec Torrent's debut.",
      "Lautaro Mart\u00ednez evened it late in the first half for Inter, but the Champions League finalists couldn't generate a second goal despite having nearly 62% possession while Monterrey got only one shot on target.",
      "Inter manager Cristian Chivu made his debut as the Nerazzurri returned to competition at the Rose Bowl just 17 days after taking that 5-0 thrashing from Paris Saint-Germain.",
      "After the 39-year-old Ramos put Los Rayados ahead, Mart\u00ednez answered in the 42nd minute with a tap-in of Carlos Augusto's pass after a world-class sequence of ball movement from a setpiece.",
      "Mart\u00ednez thought he scored again in the 68th minute, but was offside. Both teams narrowly missed goals in the final minutes, and Mart\u00ednez picked up a yellow card in second-half injury time.",
      "Chivu started only seven of Simone Inzaghi\u2019s choices for the Champions League final. Ailing striker Marcus Thuram came on early in the second half to replace 22-year-old Sebastiano Esposito, who started his first game back from seven loan stints since his previous appearance for Inter in 2020.",
      "Inter carried play early, but Ramos capitalized on Monterrey\u2019s first corner kick by outjumping two defenders and converting an acrobatic header. The Real Madrid stalwart and World Cup winner joined Monterrey four months ago.",
      "Inter still hasn't shaken off the disappointment in Munich, but both teams now have a good chance to advance from a group also including River Plate and Urawa Red Diamonds.",
      "Ramos can still summon greatness in the twilight of his career. The matchless center back will also throw out the first pitch at the Los Angeles Dodgers game on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere is always a joy to contribute to the team by scoring, but if we can get points, that\u2019s even better. We played very well as a team. Of course, football showcases the goal, but we\u2019re here to share this experience.\u201d \u2014 Ramos",
      "\u201cWe always respect our opponents, and we know football isn't always written on paper. For most of this match, we created quite a few chances, but at this moment, we don't have much energy.\u201d \u2014 Chivu",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Humans are the only animal that lives in virtually every possible environment, from rainforests to deserts to tundra.",
      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "NEW YORK -- An Australian moth follows the stars during its yearly migration, using the night sky as a guiding compass, according to a new study.",
      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",
      "It's an impressive feat for Bogong moths whose brains are smaller than size of a grain of rice to rely on the night sky for their odyssey, said study author David Dreyer with Lund University in Sweden.",
      "\u201cIt's remarkable that an animal with such a tiny brain can actually do this,\u201d Dreyer said.",

      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote before Musk became, for a time, a close adviser and chainsaw-wielding cost-cutter in Republican President Donald Trump's administration. The two billionaires have since feuded and, perhaps, made up.",
      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",
      "The New York legislation took a page from a similar law that passed in California \u2014 and drew a similar lawsuit from X.",
      "Last fall, a panel of federal appellate judges blocked portions of the California law, at least temporarily, on free speech grounds. The state subsequently settled, agreeing not to enforce the content-moderation reporting requirements.",

Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",

Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",

      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

      "LAS VEGAS -- The two people killed in a shooting over the weekend on the Las Vegas Strip captured it on video while livestreaming to their shared YouTube channel, according to a police report.",
      "The married victims were identified by the Clark County coroner's office as Tanisha Finley, 43, and Rodney Finley, 44. Both died of multiple gunshot wounds.",
      "Las Vegas police said the shooting on Sunday night near the landmark Bellagio fountains was an isolated incident between the victims and the suspect, who had been feuding on social media since at least 2023. The suspect, identified by police as Manuel D. Ruiz, surrendered to authorities Monday morning at a police station outside of Las Vegas.",
      "Ruiz, 41, faces two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and is being held without bail, jail records show.",
      "The Associated Press sent an emailed message Thursday seeking comment from his public defender. Ruiz told police after his arrest that he was acting in self-defense, according to his arrest report.",
      "The suspect is seen in the video livestream pulling a gun from his waistband, raising it and initially firing between five and six shots, according to a description of the video detailed in the report. One or two more gunshots can be heard in the video after Tanisha Finley is seen grabbing the cellphone that is being used for the livestream.",

      "The couple's son was among the 911 callers to report the shooting, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.",
      "\u201cI heard gunshots around him,\" he says. \"I think he might have got shot, so I was just trying to check and make sure, just try to see if he's OK or where he's at.\u201d",
      "In his interview with police after he surrendered, the suspect said he also has a YouTube channel and had been livestreaming from the Strip on the night of the shooting. Ruiz told police began shooting because it looked like one of the victims was reaching for a weapon, according to the report.",
      "Police said no firearms were found on the victims.",
      "The shooting happened on one of the busiest stretches of the Strip. The dancing Bellagio fountains, which soar up to 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, play every 15 minutes on the weekends between 8 p.m. and midnight.",

    "summary": "Prosecutors alleged Read hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, with her car outside another officer's home in January 2022 and then left him to die there during a blizzard.",
    "story": [
      "Read was accused of killing her boyfriend John O'Keefe in 2022.",
      "A Massachusetts jury found Karen Read not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend in 2022, nearly a year after her first prosecution ended in a mistrial.",
      "She was acquitted of the most serious charges, including second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene after an accident resulting in death.",
      "The jury did find her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor. The judge immediately sentenced her to one-year probation, the standard for a first-time offense.",
      "Cheers could be heard from outside the courthouse, where supporters of Read have gathered, while the verdict was being read. Read embraced her legal team and cried following the verdict.",
      "A new \"20/20\" special, \"Karen Read: The Verdict,\" airing Wednesday, June 18, from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET on ABC and streaming the next day on Hulu, examines the case.",
      "The jury began deliberating the afternoon of June 13 in Norfolk County before reaching a verdict Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Read hit her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, with her car outside the Canton home of fellow police officer Brian Albert after a night of heavy drinking in January 2022 and then left him to die there during a major blizzard.",
      "The defense had argued that Read's vehicle did not hit O'Keefe and instead said O'Keefe was attacked by a dog and beaten by other people who were in the house before he was thrown out in the snow to die.",
      "Read pleaded not guilty to the charges and has maintained her innocence.",
      "In brief remarks upon leaving the courthouse, she thanked her \"amazing supporters\" for their financial and emotional support for the past nearly four years.",
      "\"No one has fought harder for justice than John O'Keefe than I have -- than I have and my team,\" Read added.",
      "Following the verdict, several of the witnesses who testified against Read called the result of the retrial \"a devastating miscarriage of justice.\"",
      "\"Today, our hearts are with John and the entire O\u2019Keefe family. They have suffered through so much and deserved better from our justice system,\" members of the Albert and McCabe families said in a statement. \"While we may have more to say in the future, today we mourn with John\u2019s family and lament the cruel reality that this prosecution was infected by lies and conspiracy theories spread by Karen Read, her defense team, and some in the media.\"",
      "During deliberations, the jury asked four questions, including, \"If we find not guilty on two charges but can't agree on one charge, is it a hung jury on all three charges or just one charge?\" the judge told attorneys in court.",
      "The judge told the jury she is not able to respond to their question, telling attorneys it was a \"theoretical question.\"",
      "The jury also asked about the time frame for when Read is accused of driving under the influence, whether video clips from Read's interviews about the case are to be considered as evidence and if she is convicted on a sub-charge, if that would mean she is guilty on the overall charge.",
      "In an unusual moment, Judge Beverly Cannone told the courtroom earlier Wednesday that the jury had indicated during the lunch break that they had reached a verdict, then updated that they did not have a verdict. Cannone sealed that verdict slip and informed the court that there was not yet a verdict \"because, as we all know, there is no verdict until it is announced and recorded in open court.\" The verdict was then read in court about 30 minutes later.",
      "Read's first trial ended in a mistrial in July 2024 after the jury could not reach a verdict.",
      "At least four jurors who served on her first trial last year have confirmed that she was found not guilty of second-degree murder and leaving a scene of personal injury and death, according to Read's attorneys. However, the jury could not agree on the third charge of manslaughter while operating a motor vehicle under the influence, the attorneys said.",
      "Her lawyers filed multiple appeals, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, claiming Read should not be retried on the counts the jury apparently agreed on, saying it would amount to double jeopardy. Each appeal was denied.",
      "Read's attorneys made motions for a mistrial twice during her second criminal trial, both of which were denied by the judge.",
      "Like her first trial, Read did not take the stand in her own defense.",
      "\"I am not testifying,\" Read said to reporters outside the courthouse on June 10. \"[The jury has] heard my interview clips. They've heard my voice. They've heard a lot of me.\"",
      "Read had added one of the alternate jurors from her first trial to her legal team for the retrial. Victoria George, the alternate juror, is a licensed civil attorney in Massachusetts.",

      "Democrats say Trump should de-escalate instead of setting \"more things afire.\"",
      "Senate Republicans largely lined up behind President Donald Trump's handling of the conflict between Iran and Israel and said they trusted Trump's judgment on whether the United States ought to involve itself.",
      "Trump said again Wednesday that he has not decided whether the U.S. should get more involved in the He signaled to reporters that he would decide at the last moment, stating he\u2019d make the decision \u201cone second before.\u201d",
      "The issue of getting more involved in the conflict has divided Trump's MAGA base, with some pointing to his campaign promise to keep America out of foreign wars.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a defense hawk who said he spoke to Trump last night, endorsed the use of force if diplomatic efforts fail.",
      "\"Either you want them to have a nuclear weapon, or you don't,\" Graham said. \"And if you don't, if diplomacy fails, you use force.\"",
      "Most Republicans said that they agreed with Trump that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"I think this is something on which the entire world can agree: Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, or the ability to deliver a nuclear warhead, period,\" Sen. John Kennedy said.",
      "\"American foreign policy is always a balance between ... between values and interests. The value here is obvious to everyone. Iran cannot have a bomb. It's just unthinkable, and I support the president unconditionally on that,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds said there is evidence that Iran was getting closer to building a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"If Israel has a plan which is appropriate to take care of the problem, then we don't need to be there, but we should never take or eliminate options that are available to the president in exercising his authority as the commander-in-chief,\" Rounds said.",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer said he would support Trump's decision if he decided to enter the conflict, but would also support a decision to instead \"assist Israel in getting the job done.\"",
      "\"Iran's made that really crystal clear. They pledged to wipe out the United States of America. I prefer not to let them get here,\" Cramer said. \"I prefer preemptive prevention of war rather than having to end one after it gets to our soil, right?\"",
      "Cramer said Trump has been handling the crisis \"brilliantly\"and applauded Trump's suggestion that he may or may not get involved.",
      "\"I think that's pretty honest, right? I may or I may not. I think that that the element of of surprise, if you will, is maintained by an answer that doesn't tell you what he's going to do,\" he said. \"It'd be crazy for the president to give a warning, if you will, of what he may do.\"",
      "Both Republicans and Democrats said they would like Congress to have a role in determining whether the U.S. gets involved in the conflict, but Republicans were much less forceful.",
      "\"I would love to see Congress have a role, but we certainly don't have time in the midst of what we all see going on for Congress to sit and cogitate for six or eight months,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Democrats, on the other hand, said Trump should get Congress' approval before taking any military action.",
      "\"At some point, the president must come to Congress if there is to be active, kinetic military involvement that constitutes war. That's the Constitution, Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. \"And I believe that the president has to face accountability at some point, for the use of military force in combat, in a war. And the question is, when that point is.\"",
      "Other Democrats said the U.S. should be trying to de-escalate the conflict rather than inflame it.",
      "\"We don't need to escalate in Iran. That doesn't make anyone in the Middle East safer, and it certainly doesn't make the United States any safer right now, Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. \"The role of the United States should be to help de-escalate, to push for negotiations, not to try to set more things afire.\"",

      "\"It's sort of amusing the extent to which the speculation is out there,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"So what is the order? Then list it out for us. List it out for us. Be a man. Did you authorize them to detain or arrest?\" Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who served in Iraq, said.",
      "The senator questioned Hegseth about the possibility of an order given for the military to use lethal force against protesters.",
      "\"I'm just asking the question. Don't laugh,\" Slotkin said after Hegseth brushed off the question.",
      "\"What is that based on?\" Hegseth responded. \"What evidence do you have that that order has ever been given?\"",
      "Slotkin responded that his predecessor, Mark Esper, didn't accept such an order during the first administration. She cited Esper's memoir where he claimed Trump inquired if the military could shoot protesters who demonstrated in the streets during the 2020 George Floyd protests.",
      "\"He had more guts and balls than you because he said, I'm not going to send in a uniformed military to do something that I know in my gut isn't right \u2026 You're pooh-poohing this,\" the senator said.",
      "Hegseth testified that there was \"zero indication that an order was given to shoot protesters and that has not happened.\"",
      "But when she asked whether troops could use force against unarmed civilians, Hegseth wouldn\u2019t say.",
      "\"I'd be careful what you read in books and believing it. Except for the Bible,\" he said.",
      "Hegseth responded similarly when questioned by Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Ariz, earlier in the hearing.",
      "Rosen asked about the firings of several top national security officials, including the director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Timothy Haugh, that were allegedly done at the request of far-right social media influencer Laura Loomer.",
      "\"She's been denounced even by Republicans, and the idea is that any leaders within our agency responsible for our nation's security, somebody would be dismissed based on the advice of a social media influencer,\" Rosen said.",
      "Hegseth reiterated that the panel should not be \"believing everything you read in the media.\"",
      "\"I don't discuss who I talk about anything with, but ultimately, this is my decision and he serves at the pleasure of the president and that's why he's no longer there,\" he said.",
      "\"Do you believe it's appropriate for social media to influence personnel decisions in your department, yes or no?\" Rosen asked. Time then expired. The chairman left a moment for Hegseth to answer the question, as witnesses often do after a lawmaker has asked their final question.",
      "Hegseth took a beat, and said, \"I believe your time is up.\"",
      "Rosen pushed back.",
      "\"Oh, it is not up to you to tell me when my time is up. I am going to say, Mr. Secretary, you're either feckless or complicit. You're not in control of your department,\" she replied. \"You [are] unserious. ... I yield back and I don't appreciate the smirk, sir. You are the secretary of defense.\"",

    "story": [
      "The national hotline launched a pilot program in 2022 focused on LGBTQ+ youth.",
      "The federal government said on Tuesday it is ending the national suicide hotline's specialized support for LGBTQ+ youth next month.",
      "In a press release, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) -- which falls under the Department of Health and Human Services -- said the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline would close the LGBTQ+ Youth Specialized Services program on July 17.",
      "\"The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline will no longer silo LGB+ youth services, also known as the 'Press 3 option,' to focus on serving all help seekers, including those previously served through the Press 3 option,\" SAMHSA said in statement.",
      "\"Everyone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress,\" the statement continued. \"Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.\"",
      "In September 2022, 988 launched a pilot program to specifically address the needs of LGBTQ+ Americans under age 25 by providing services with a counselor trained to support LGBTQ+ youth and young adults. In March 2023, the program expanded to 24/7 services.",
      "SAMHSA data shows more than 1.2 million LGBTQ+ people contacted 988 between July 2022 -- the beginning of the new three-digit number for the national suicide hotline -- and February 2025.",
      "The Trevor Project, a nonprofit focusing on suicide prevention efforts among LGBTQ+ youth, was among those providing support for the specialized program. The organization said on Wednesday that it received notice the program was ending.",

      "U.S. officials signaled Tuesday that the next 24 to 48 hours would be critical.",
      "As President Donald Trump huddled with his top advisers in the White House Situation Room on Tuesday, U.S. officials signaled that the next 24 to 48 hours would be critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible -- or if the president might resort to military action instead.",
      "Trump significantly ramped up his rhetoric against the Iranian regime ahead of the meeting, asserting that the U.S. knew exactly where Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was hiding.",
      "\"He is an easy target, but is safe there -- We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin,\" Trump wrote on social media.",
      "\"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,\" he claimed in another post.",
      "Despite the apparent saber rattling, U.S. negotiators on Tuesday continued to assess that Iran is in a weak position and could be forced to come back to the negotiating table and to ultimately accept a deal that would require it abandon all nuclear enrichment, according to multiple officials involved in the diplomatic process.",
      "As Iran and Israel trade blows, the Iranian regime has signaled a willingness to resume discussions with the U.S., the officials said, adding that the Trump administration has been looking for more concrete commitments before backing off the war path.",
      "If Iran returns to the negotiations and agrees to drop its uranium enrichment, U.S. officials believe a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and potentially Vice President JD Vance would happen as soon as this week.",
      "But that scenario likely requires Iran to move quickly. The president has already acknowledged his patience with the situation in the Middle East is wearing thin.",
      "Sources familiar with the president's mindset said he has grown frustrated by a destabilized Iran's inability to provide the administration with immediate answers and also appears highly disinclined to allow for a situation to unfold where it appears as if Tehran has successfully called his military bluff.",
      "The U.S. military is already sending assets toward the region, including sending additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier and its strike group to the Middle East -- all moves that are defensive in nature, officials say.",
      "\"We're strong, we're prepared, we're defensive and present,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said of the U.S. posture in the Middle East during an interview with Fox News on Monday.",
      "But while the repositioning of assets is intended to protect the 40,000 estimated American troops stationed in the region, it also leaves options open for the Trump administration if it decides to directly assist with Israel's ongoing offensive operation against Iran.",
      "\"It's our role to keep options on the table, but our posture is still defensive,\" said a U.S. official.",
      "A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers. The heavy strategic bombers are capable of carrying the 30,000 pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bombs, which might be able to destroy Iran's deep underground nuclear facility at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant.",
      "Currently, the military's fleet of 19 B-2 bombers is located at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri. Six of the aircraft were previously deployed to the airbase on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean -- much closer to Iran. However, they were replaced by B-52 long-range bombers which are not capable of carrying the bunker-buster bombs needed to destroy the Fordo site.",
      "Already, roughly a dozen U.S. Navy vessels are in Bahrain's territorial waters away from post, according to a Defense Department official, who said that the ships do not have any official tasking. Among them are a littoral combat ship, four minesweepers, and six water patrol craft, the official said.",
      "The Navy also has two destroyers in the Red Sea, an aircraft carrier, and three other surface ships in the Arabian Sea. Two more American destroyers are in the eastern Mediterranean Sea -- each equipped with missile defense systems capable of shooting down Iranian ballistic missiles.",
      "Signs the Trump administration could be inching toward military action could include canceling the president's plans to travel to the Netherlands for a NATO summit next week.",
      "At a press briefing on Tuesday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the summit was still \"on the books\" -- but said the situation could change depending on the dynamic with Iran.",
      "\"This is something that is moving -- as things tend to -- very rapidly. So, I would say that anything is possible,\" she said.",
      "Already, the president made an early exit from the G7 summit in Canada, opting to cut his time there short on Monday in order to monitor the situation in the Middle East from the White House.",

      "ABC News contributor and retired Col. Steve Ganyard said the bomb, which has never been used in combat, was designed specifically to be used against targets in Iran and elsewhere where facilities have been built underground and protected by thick concrete.",
      "\"You make sure you save them for places like Iran and North Korea because you don't need something that goes that deep\" in normal circumstances, he said.",

    "story": [
      "His comments come amid an growing divide among Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters",
      "In a lengthy post on X on Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance came to the defense of President Donald Trump after supporters like Tucker Carlson and those in the MAGA base have been outspoken about the U.S. not getting involved in the war between Israel and Iran.",
      "\"First, POTUS has been amazingly consistent, over 10 years, that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. Over the last few months, he encouraged his foreign policy team to reach a deal with the Iranians to accomplish this goal,\" Vance wrote on X. \"The president has made clear that Iran cannot have uranium enrichment. And he said repeatedly that this would happen one of two ways--the easy way or the \"other\" way.\"",
      "Vance continued, explaining the difference between \"civilian nuclear power\" and \"uranium enrichment.\" The vice president told his followers that Iran has \"been found in violation of their non-proliferation obligations by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\"",
      "\"He may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment. That decision ultimately belongs to the president,\" Vance wrote. \"And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue. And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish American people's goals. Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Vance's comments come amid a quickly escalating divide among some of Trump's most vocal supporters being led in part by two prominent Trump allies: Trump's longtime adviser Steve Bannon and Carlson, the right-wing commentator -- who continue to speak out against U.S. involvement in the Iran-Israel conflict.",
      "Bannon went on Carlson's podcast Monday night and warned that further involvement would \"blow up\" the Trump coalition and derail the president's national agenda, particularly on immigration.",
      "\"If we get sucked into this war, which inexorably looks like it's going to happen on the combat side, it's going to not just blow up the coalition, it's also gonna thwart what we're doing with the most important thing, which is the deportation of the illegal alien invaders that are here,\" he said.",
      "Earlier Monday, Carlson appeared on Bannon's show and said the move could lead to \"the end of the American empire\" and could \"effectively\" end Trump's presidency.",
      "Trump swatted down Carlson's comments, calling him \"Kooky\" in a post on Truth Social and telling reporters Carlson should \"get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",
      "But other leading MAGA voices are weighing in, including an exceedingly rare comment from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene pushing back on Trump's jab at Carlson without naming him, writing in a lengthy post that Carlson's comments regarding Iran are \"not kooky.\"",
      "\"Tucker Carlson is one of my favorite people. He fiercely loves his wife, children, and our country. Since being fired by the neocon network Fox News, he has more popularity and viewers than ever before. He unapologetically believes the same things I do. That if we don't fight for our own country and our own people then we will no longer have a country for our children and our grandchildren. And foreign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction. That's not kooky. That's what millions of Americans voted for. It's what we believe is America First,\" she wrote.",
      "Greene also appeared on longtime Trump ally and former Rep. Matt Gaetz's show on Monday, and the pair both urged the president to \"reject\" calls to join the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "Asked Tuesday on Capitol Hill if his post was directed specifically at conservatives or those who usually support the MAGA movement, Vance said it was \"not targeted at any particular demographic of the country\" and was directed toward \"everybody who is interested.\"",
      "The vice president said he wrote the post to help Americans understand why the administration is so focused on Iran.",
      "\"I just wanted to explain to the American people, if you want safety, part of safety, and I think all Americans want that, is ensuring that the worst people in the world don't have a nuclear bomb. And part of ensuring that they don't have a nuclear bomb is ensuring that they don't have the enrichment capacity to get there. I just kind of wanted to lay that out and sot of explain why we're talking about this issue and why the President is so focused on this question,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance didn't directly answer questions about whether the U.S. will strike Iran as he was leaving a closed-door lunch with Senate Republicans about Trump's megabill, but he repeatedly reiterated the president's policy position that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon or enriched uranium.",
      "\"It's so bizarre to me that the Iranians seem confused about what's going on,\" Vance said. \"The president has been as clear as possible for as long as possible that part of his no-nuclear policy is Iranians are not allowed to have enrichment in their country.\"",

      "\"The public is counting on us to ensure this never happens again, because we won't always be fortunate enough to have a leader like President Trump, who is so unmistakably in command,\" Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt said.",
      "In May, Senate Republicans announced their plans to launch the probe into Biden's mental fitness while in office -- including his use of autopen, a mechanical device to automatically add a signature to a document that's been utilized by several past presidents, including Trump in his first term.",
      "The hearing also comes after Trump earlier this month ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether Biden's administration sought to conspire to cover up his alleged mental state while in office. The move by the White House represents a significant escalation, as it is a directive to the Justice Department to formally investigate.",
      "Biden responded to the Trump order, saying \"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency.\"",
      "\"I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said in a statement.",
      "In May, House Oversight Chairman James Comer requested Biden's White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, appear for a transcribed interview as part of an investigation into Biden's mental fitness and use of a presidential autopen while in office. Comer asked O'Connor to sit for an interview on June 25.",
      "The calls for the probes into Biden also come after the recent release of \"Original Sin\" by CNN host Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson, claiming the Bidens had a \"capacity for denial and the lengths they would go to avoid transparency about health issues.\"",
      "In response to the book's release, a Biden spokesman said \"there is nothing in this book that shows Joe Biden failed to do his job, as the authors have alleged, nor did they prove their allegation that there was a cover up or conspiracy.\"",
      "On Wednesday morning, Trump -- who often criticizes Biden -- lambasted the former president's use of autopen and claimed that Biden didn't have control while leading the country.",
      "\"All these people, all the scum that was around the Oval, you know, the Oval Office, or around the beautiful Resolute desk, telling this guy here, 'Do this,' 'Do that,' and not even tell him. They just go over to the autopen and sign whatever the hell they wanted to sign,\" he said.",
      "Trump claimed that it was aides who were making decisions for Biden -- employing the autopen to carry out an agenda.",
      "\"He wasn't for open borders, he wasn't for transgender for everybody. He wasn't for men playing in women's sports. But he has no idea what the hell -- he has no idea,\" Trump claimed.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago notes the contradiction of Barcelona\u2019s Mayor Jaume Collboni backing the expansion of the city's international airport \u2014 announced this week \u2014 while still planning to wipe out the tourist apartments.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "A team of 60 international scientists report that by early 2028 society will have emitted enough greenhouse gases that the Earth will be pretty much locked into hitting the internationally agreed upon preferred limit for global warming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas in less than three years that a key threshold for limiting global warming will be nearly unavoidable, according to a study to be released Thursday.",
      "The report predicts that society will have emitted enough carbon dioxide by early 2028 that crossing an important long-term temperature boundary will be more likely than not. The scientists calculate that by that point there will be enough of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere to create a 50-50 chance or greater that the world will be locked in to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times. That level of gas accumulation, which comes from the burning of fuels like gasoline, oil and coal, is sooner than the same group of 60 international scientists calculated in a study last year.",
      "\u201cThings aren\u2019t just getting worse. They\u2019re getting worse faster,\u201d said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the climate monitoring group Berkeley Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re actively moving in the wrong direction in a critical period of time that we would need to meet our most ambitious climate goals. Some reports, there\u2019s a silver lining. I don\u2019t think there really is one in this one.\u201d",
      "That 1.5 goal, first set in the 2015 Paris agreement, has been a cornerstone of international efforts to curb worsening climate change. Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations. Over the last 150 years, scientists have established a direct correlation between the release of certain levels of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases like methane, and specific increases in global temperatures.",
      "In Thursday's Indicators of Global Climate Change report, researchers calculated that society can spew only 143 billion more tons (130 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide before the 1.5 limit becomes technically inevitable. The world is producing 46 billion tons (42 billion metric tons) a year, so that inevitability should hit around February 2028 because the report is measured from the start of this year, the scientists wrote. The world now stands at about 1.24 degrees Celsius (2.23 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times, the report said.",
      "The report, which was published in the journal Earth System Science Data, shows that the rate of human-caused warming per decade has increased to nearly half a degree (0.27 degrees Celsius) per decade, Hausfather said. And the imbalance between the heat Earth absorbs from the sun and the amount it radiates out to space, a key climate change signal, is accelerating, the report said.",
      "\u201cIt's quite a depressing picture unfortunately, where if you look across the indicators, we find that records are really being broken everywhere,\u201d said lead author Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds in England. \u201cI can't conceive of a situation where we can really avoid passing 1.5 degrees of very long-term temperature change.\u201d",
      "The increase in emissions from fossil-fuel burning is the main driver. But reduced particle pollution, which includes soot and smog, is another factor because those particles had a cooling effect that masked even more warming from appearing, scientists said. Changes in clouds also factor in. That all shows up in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, which is now 25% higher than it was just a decade or so ago, Forster said.",
      "Earth\u2019s energy imbalance \u201cis the most important measure of the amount of heat being trapped in the system,\u201d Hausfather said.",
      "Earth keeps absorbing more and more heat than it releases. \u201cIt is very clearly accelerating. It\u2019s worrisome,\u201d he said.",
      "The planet temporarily passed the key 1.5 limit last year. The world hit 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times for an entire year in 2024, but the Paris threshold is meant to be measured over a longer period, usually considered 20 years. Still, the globe could reach that long-term threshold in the next few years even if individual years haven't consistently hit that mark, because of how the Earth's carbon cycle works.",
      "That 1.5 is \u201ca clear limit, a political limit for which countries have decided that beyond which the impact of climate change would be unacceptable to their societies,\u201d said study co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.",
      "The mark is so important because once it is crossed, many small island nations could eventually disappear because of sea level rise, and scientific evidence shows that the impacts become particularly extreme beyond that level, especially hurting poor and vulnerable populations, he said. He added that efforts to curb emissions and the impacts of climate change must continue even if the 1.5 degree threshold is exceeded.",
      "Crossing the threshold \"means increasingly more frequent and severe climate extremes of the type we are now seeing all too often in the U.S. and around the world \u2014 unprecedented heat waves, extreme hot drought, extreme rainfall events, and bigger storms,\u201d said University of Michigan environment school dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist who wasn't part of the study, said the 1.5 goal was aspirational and not realistic, so people shouldn\u2019t focus on that particular threshold.",
      "\u201cMissing it does not mean the end of the world,\u201d Dessler said in an email, though he agreed that \u201ceach tenth of a degree of warming will bring increasingly worse impacts.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- A former Fulton County jail guard has been indicted on federal civil rights charges after prosecutors said she used her Taser abusively against three inmates and then lied to cover it up.",
      "Khadijah Solomon, a 47-year-old Fairburn resident, pleaded not guilty to the six-count indictment in federal court in Atlanta on Tuesday and was released on bail. The troubled jail where Solomon worked has been under a federal civil rights investigation for the past two years and was also the site where Donald Trump surrendered on election interference charges in 2023.",
      "Solomon's lawyer, Devin Rafus, said his client will fight the allegations.",
      "\u201cThe Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office is under a lot of political pressure with the Department of Justice investigating the jail,\u201d Rafus said via email. \u201cMy client is collateral damage of that pressure.\u201d",
      "The June 11 indictment said Solomon used her Taser \u201cwithout legal justification\" against separate inmates at the Atlanta jail on Jan. 16, Jan. 25 and Jan. 27. The indictment alleges that Solomon then wrote reports falsely justifying what she did.",
      "In reality, sheriff's office investigators said body-worn camera video showed the pretrial detainees were compliant and not resisting.",
      "In the Jan. 16 incident, sheriff's office investigators said Solomon approached an inmate who was kicking his cell door and said she was about to \u201cpop\u201d him before opening the cell and using the Taser on the inmate. Investigators said Solomon then stunned the inmate twice more. She later claimed in her report that the inmate \u201cwas getting ready to throw\u201d a tray at her.",
      "The sheriff's office in February announced that it had fired Solomon and two other jail officers \u2014 Chantrece Buggs and LaQuondria Pierce \u2014 arrested them, and charged them with state crimes including aggravated assault and violating their oath of office. Solomon, a jail sergeant, was also charged with cruelty to inmates and false statements or writings.",
      "At the time, investigators said Pierce used her Taser without justification on an inmate Feb. 13 and Buggs encouraged Solomon's violence. No federal charges against the other two were announced, and neither has yet been indicted in a state court.",
      "Rafus, who is also the lawyer representing Pierce, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on her state charges.",
      "Natalie Ammons, a spokesperson for Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat, said the sheriff's office had worked with the FBI in the Solomon case.",
      "\u201cOn three occasions, Khadijah Solomon allegedly tased Fulton County Jail detainees without a legitimate purpose, causing each of them pain and injury,\" U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg said in a statement. \"Abuses of power of this kind are unconstitutional, erode our community\u2019s trust, and will be prosecuted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Justice Department in July 2023 opened a civil rights investigation into jail conditions in Fulton County, citing violence, filthy living quarters and the in-custody death of a man whose body was found covered in insects. That investigation found that jail officers didn't receive adequate training and guidance on the use of force and were found to engage in \u201ca pattern or practice of using excessive force\u201d against people in county custody.",
      "The Justice Department and Fulton County officials announced in January that they had entered into a court-enforceable consent decree. An independent monitor was appointed in February to oversee that agreement.",

      "Consumers Energy had planned to close the power station by May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy. But the Energy Department intervened just days earlier, saying the plant must remain open, at least until late August, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S.",
      "The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, known as MISO, manages the flow of electricity in 15 U.S. states and Manitoba in Canada. MISO has said there should be enough electricity this summer though it cited the potential for \u201celevated risk\u201d during extreme weather.",

      "A new United Nations report says that Iran carried out executions at \u201can alarming rate\u201d last year with at least 975 people killed",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Iran carried out executions at \u201can alarming rate\u201d last year with at least 975 people killed, the United Nations chief said in a report that also cited other human rights abuses, from barriers to freedom of expression to the use of torture and arbitrary detention.",
      "U.N. deputy human rights commissioner Nada Al-Nashif, who presented the report to the Geneva-based Human Rights Council on Wednesday, urged Iran to halt all executions as a first step toward a ban.",
      "She also called for urgent diplomatic negotiations to end the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The 975 people executed in 2024 surpassed the estimated 834 in 2023 and was the highest rate of executions since 2015, said the report by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Four of the executions were carried out publicly. Iran carries out executions by hanging.",
      "Of those executed, 52% were for drug-related offenses, 43% for murder, 2% for sexual offenses and 3% for security-related offenses, the report said.",
      "The number of women executed also increased. According to information received by the U.N. human rights office, at least 31 women were reported to have been executed in 2024, up from at least 22 in 2023. Among those 31 women were 19 reportedly executed for murder, including nine convicted of killing their husbands in cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage or child marriage.",
      "Also among those executed were women and men connected to protests that began in September 2022 following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, who was arrested by Iran\u2019s morality police and accused of not wearing her head covering correctly.",
      "The report also said a disproportionate number of those executed were from Iran's minorities, with at least 108 Baluch prisoners and 84 Kurdish prisoners among those executed last year.",
      "Citing information received by the human rights office, the report said at least 31 people, including political dissidents, were executed for national security-related offenses such as spying for Israel.",
      "The rights office said it also received reports of torture, arbitrary detention and trials that failed to comply with due process and fair trial standards.",
      "As for the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, the report said information received by the rights office found that at least 125 journalists were prosecuted for their work in 2024. At least 40 female journalists were prosecuted or summoned for their reporting, the report said.",
      "Al-Nashif said Iran has cooperated with the human rights office, but Guterres regrets that the government has denied access to the independent international fact-finding mission on Iran that the Human Rights Council established.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida's public universities can free up $22.5 million a year to compensate student-athletes under an emergency rule approved by a state board Wednesday ahead of a landmark legal settlement allowing schools to pay their players through licensing deals.",
      "The sprawling $2.8 billion antitrust settlement, going into effect July 1, allows schools to directly pay their pay their players for the use of their name, image and likeness. It's upending the way college sports have been run for more than a century and has sent universities across the country scrambling for new revenue streams in the hopes of gaining an edge \u2014 or at least keeping pace \u2014 in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college athletics.",
      "Public universities in Florida, which is home to some of the country\u2019s most high-profile college sports teams, will now be able to dip into the funding reserves of campus auxiliary programs like bookstores, food service, student housing and parking in order to cut checks to student-athletes. Under the policy approved Wednesday, the funds can be issued as a transfer or a loan.",
      "\u201cAthletic departments are already currently recruiting student-athletes for fall 2025, and they need clarity on the available funding to retain and recruit the best talent for their rosters,\u201d said Alan Levine, vice chair of the board of governors, which oversees Florida's state universities. \u201cIf the universities cannot react to the settlement immediately, there will be irreparable harm to the athletic programs and to the financial welfare of our institutions.\"",
      "Florida's emergency rule goes into effect immediately and will last 90 days, at which point the board of governors can reassess the issue.",
      "Other schools are also taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct payments to athletes.",
      "Meanwhile, Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments. And Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The American flag has long flown from a pole on the White House roof, but that's always been too small for President Donald Trump, who wants everything to be bigger and more beautiful.",
      "On Wednesday, massive new flagpoles were erected on the North and South Lawns of the White House.",
      "\u201cIt's such a beautiful pole,\u201d Trump said as workers used a crane to install the latest addition to the South Lawn. He returned to the same spot later in the day, saluting as the stars and stripes were hoisted for the first time.",
      "The second pole, on the North Lawn, is close to Pennsylvania Avenue. The two poles are the most notable exterior modification to the White House since Trump returned to the presidency with grand ideas for remaking the building.",
      "He's already updated the Oval Office, adding gold accents, more portraits and a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Workers have begun paving over the grass in the Rose Garden, and there are plans to construct a new ballroom somewhere on the White House grounds. The changes bring the iconic building more in line with Mar-a-Lago, Trump's private club in Florida.",
      "The president made time to watch one of the flagpole installations despite the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, plus questions of whether the U.S. would become directly involved.",
      "\u201cI love construction,\u201d said Trump, who made his mark as a New York real estate developer. \u201cI know it better than anybody.\u201d",
      "He talked about how the pole went down nine feet deep for stability, and the rope would be contained inside the cylinder, unlike the one at Mar-a-Lago. When the wind blows, \u201cyou hear that rope, banging.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the real deal,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the best you can get. There\u2019s nothing like this.\u201d",

      "A retired Connecticut police detective who went missing last year was found seven months later buried under debris in hoarding conditions in her home",
      "GLASTONBURY, Conn. -- Mary Notarangelo lived a reclusive life in her later years, according to the few people who had contact with her. The retired police detective tended to her many birds at her Connecticut home and posted videos of them on social media, including one accompanying her on a trip to a local crafts store.",
      "But a welfare check request to police last year uncovered disturbing truths. Hoarding conditions were found in her house in Glastonbury, just southeast of Hartford, when authorities tried to find her last July. It wasn't until February that a work crew using a small excavator discovered her skeletal remains. They were found beneath a pile of debris heaped just inside her front door, according to a police report released Wednesday.",
      "Glastonbury police said conditions in the single-family home set off a rural road in the woods were among the worst they've seen and hindered several search attempts over the months. Officers said there were 6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) \u201cmountains\u201d of garbage blocking entrance doors. Dead birds were found in cages along with mice running about and a live cat. And there was a terrible stench.",
      "\u201cOnce inside, I observed more mountains of garbage, cobwebs, and spiders,\u201d Officer Anthony Longo wrote in the report. \u201cThere was no path whatsoever. The only way to move from room to room was by climbing over the garbage.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how Notarangelo died. At 73, she was a retired Bridgeport police detective and longtime Wiccan, according to officials and friends. Her death was first reported by Hearst Connecticut Media earlier Wednesday.",
      "The state medical examiner's office said her cause of death could not be determined because the remains were mostly skeletal. A friend had called police to request the welfare check July 3, 2024. He told investigators Notarangelo last texted him around June 12, 2024, saying she was having abdominal cramps, vomiting and had fallen. It's not clear why the friend \u2014 who did not return phone and text messages \u2014 waited so long to call authorities.",
      "It's also not clear why it took seven months to find her remains, although several attempts had been made and officials cited the mounds of trash and other items. A police spokesperson did not immediately return an email seeking comment about the timeline.",
      "\u201cIt's so upsetting and so sad,\u201d said another friend, Patti Steeves, who worked with Notarangelo at the Bridgeport Police Department as a civilian employee years ago. \u201cShe, as quirky as she was, she was a good person at heart.\u201d",
      "Steeves added: \u201cShe was passionate about her faith. She was passionate about her job. She had a great sense of humor. And she loved her animals. She loved her animals more than she did herself.\u201d",
      "Steeves said she tried to talk with Notarangelo about the hoarding, but Notarangelo wouldn't discuss it.",
      "She said Notarangelo was a \u201cbird fanatic\u201d who had about 20 birds, including cockatoos, cockatiels and parrots, and a cat and a dog.",
      "Bridgeport police said Notarangelo worked there from 1985 to 1996. She was promoted to detective in 1992 and to sergeant a year later. Steeves said she retired on disability after an on-duty car crash that injured her back and legs.",
      "Notarangelo posted occasionally on her social media accounts, saying she was an animal lover and an \u201cintuitive & reiki master,\u201d referring to the Japanese healing practice. She posted videos and photos of her birds, including a cockatoo perched on a shopping cart during her outing to a crafts store.",
      "Police and firefighters first searched the home on July 3, 2024, the day of the welfare check request but couldn't find her, citing hoarding piles as a major factor. They also sent a drone in the house, but it hit cobwebs and became disabled, police said. More searches, they said, were conducted on July 5, July 11, July 12 and Nov. 20.",
      "On Feb. 24, an environmental services crew arrived with a small excavator. Plywood was removed from the front door area and crews used the excavator to carefully remove the contents of the home through the opening. Notarangelo's remains were discovered within minutes, police said.",
      "An attorney was assigned to handle Notarangelo's estate in March. He did not return phone and email messages Wednesday.",
      "Relatives of Notarangelo, including her brother and niece, declined to comment.",

      "Investigators say runway lights that would have helped guide a small jet into a San Diego airport in foggy weather before it crashed and killed all six aboard hadn't worked since 2022",
      "The runway lights that would have helped guide a small jet into a San Diego airport in foggy weather before the plane crashed, killing all six aboard, hadn't worked since 2022, investigators said. But it's unclear whether the pilot who was based at the airport knew the lights were out service.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board's issued its preliminary report Wednesday on the early morning crash of May 22 that also injured eight people on the ground. It confirmed that the Cessna came in too low as it approached the airport and struck power lines before the plane broke apart, crashing in a nearby neighborhood. The plane struck one home and that 20 vehicles were also damaged by the crash and ensuing fire.",
      "The jet was carrying a music executive named Dave Shapiro and five others. No one in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy housing died, but eight people were treated for smoke inhalation from the fiery crash and non-life-threatening injuries after the crash near Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.",
      "The pilot acknowledged the weather conditions for landing at the small airport were not ideal and debated diverting to a different airport while discussing the visibility with an air traffic controller at a regional Federal Aviation Administration control facility, according to audio of the conversation posted by LiveATC.net.",
      "The FAA had posted an official notice for pilots that the runway alignment lights were out of service, but the NTSB said that had been the case since March 2022. Repairs to those lights had been delayed while waiting for an environmental study. The NTSB said it appeared the pilot tried to activate the lights by keying his microphone seven times while approaching the airport.",
      "The NTSB said the pilot was based out of the executive airport near where the crash occurred. Shapiro had a pilot's license and was listed as the owner of the plane. But the preliminary report did not say whether investigators have determined whether the pilot knew the runway lights were not working.",
      "A power surge had also knocked out the weather system at the airport but the pilot was aware of the fog and an air traffic controller gave him weather information from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) to the north.",
      "The NTSB said the plane was only about 60 feet (18 meters) above the ground when it struck the power lines above the neighborhood. The NTSB said the plane should have been flying almost 200 feet (60 meters) higher as it approached the airport.",
      "Wednesday's report does not list the cause of the crash. That won't be officially determined until the final report is done sometime next year.",

      "Dozens of Read supporters, dressed mostly in pink, were camped out waiting for the verdict. They gathered behind barricades and across the courthouse each morning to catch a glimpse of Read. Once she would pass, the crowd would retire to beach chairs where they would swap stories and details about the case.",
      "The crowd, some of whom come waving American flags or posters supporting Read or denigrating the prosecution, said they are there because Read could have been one of them.

      "Trump now alleges that Biden administration officials may have forged the former president\u2019s signature and taken sweeping actions without his knowledge, though he provided no evidence of that happening. But Trump has ordered lawyers at the White House and the Justice Department to investigate.",
      "Republicans played clips during the hearing Wednesday of Democrats defending Biden. In the montage, the Democrats talk about how Biden was mentally sharp when he was in office.",
      "\u201cMost Democrats on this committee have chosen to all but boycott the hearing and have failed to call a single witness,\u201d said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. \u201cThey have chosen to ignore this issue, like they ignored President Biden's decline.\u201d",

      "\u201cApparently arm chair diagnosing former President Biden is more important than the issues of grave concern,\u201d said Durbin of Illinois.",
      "After his opening remarks, Durbin played a video montage of his own \u2014 but with clips of Trump speaking that he said reflected the \u201ccognitive ability\u201d of the current president. Durbin left the hearing after his opening remarks.",
      "Three witnesses testified: former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, former White House official Theodore Wold and University of Virginia law professor John Harrison. Spicer and Wold both served under Trump.",

      "GOP Sen. Katie Britt also questioned Spicer on \u201cwhat mechanisms should we put in place\u201d to hold the media accountable \u201cfor not actually following what is clearly in front of them.\u201d",

Those wishing to watch the Assembly session from the gallery could do so, but they were encouraged to instead view it from another room.",
      "In a more visible sign of force, there were state patrol officers in the building and around both legislative chambers in addition to the usual Capitol Police.",

      "\u201cA lot of those folks have been saying, where\u2019s summer? Well, buckle up, because it\u2019s coming,\u201d said Kines. The humid conditions will make places that exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) feel as much as 20 degrees hotter, said Kines.",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir that traps heat and humidity, said Ricky Castro, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Illinois.",
      "According to the NWS Weather Prediction Center, daytime temperatures will be in the 90s Fahrenheit (30s Celsius) and overnight temperatures will only drop to the mid-70s Fahrenheit (mid-20s Celsius) from the Great Lakes to the East Coast during the heat wave that's expected to last into next week.",
      "Moisture blown northward from the Gulf of Mexico is fueling the muggy weather, said Jacob Asherman, a Weather Prediction Center meteorologist. This influx of Gulf moisture is fairly typical during late spring and summer, he said.",
      "The heat will be widespread into next week. On Friday, Denver could reach 100\u00b0F (38\u00b0C), according to the weather service. Chicago temperatures could reach 96 degrees (36\u00b0C) on Sunday.

Parts of Nebraska and Kansas will be in the highest of four categories on the scale on Saturday, meaning that anyone without effective cooling or sufficient hydration could face health risks. On Sunday, Iowa, Wisconsin, Missouri and Illinois also see a category 4 rating.",
      "Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air, and the heat index is what the temperature feels like when the humidity outside is factored in, according to the weather service.",
      "When humans sweat, it cools the body down because it absorbs and removes heat as it evaporates off the skin. The air is saturated with water on humid days, which makes it harder for sweat to evaporate. Hot and humid days can be dangerous when the body is unable to cool itself off and can exacerbate pre-existing health conditions and even lead to heat stroke.",
      "Minimizing direct sun exposure, wearing loose and light-colored clothing, staying hydrated and spending time in air-conditioned spaces are ways to cool down during extreme heat, according to the NWS.",
      "Some parts of the U.S., such as Phoenix, Arizona, are famously hot without the mugginess. Phoenix and nearby desert regions experience this so-called \u201cdry heat\u201d due to being located far away from large water bodies, mountains that block moist air masses and weather patterns that bring scarce precipitation.",
      "Sweat evaporates faster in dry climates compared to humid ones. This can be dangerous because it is easy to underestimate how dehydrated you are, according to Johns Hopkins University and Johns Hopkins Health System.",
      "In places such as Iowa, crops can affect the humidity in summer months. Plants feel the effects of hot weather and some people in the Midwest are familiar with \u201c corn sweat,\u201d which is when crops move water to their leaves and other surfaces so it can evaporate, according to the Ohio State University.",
      "Madison County, Iowa, farmer Ryan Marquardt said corn sweat is \u201cnot as bad as a sauna, but it definitely would have a sauna effect. It\u2019s humid in there (the cornfield), so you\u2019re gonna sweat.\u201d",

      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and the main architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, has pushed ICE to aim for at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "ICE said authorities had \u201creceived intelligence\u201d that businesses operating at the racetrack's stables employed \u201cunauthorized workers\u201d who were then targeted in the raid.",
      "Of the dozens of workers detained during the raid, \u201cat least two\u201d had prior criminal records, according to the agency.",
      "\u201cThese enforcement operations aim to disrupt illegal employment networks that threaten the integrity of our labor systems, put American jobs at risk and create pathways for exploitation within critical sectors of our economy,\u201d said Steven Stavinoha, U.S. Customs and Border Protection director of field operations in New Orleans, in a written statement.",
      "\u201cOur Company complies fully with federal labor laws, and to our knowledge, no Delta Downs team members were involved in this matter,\u201d said David Strow, a spokesperson for Boyd Gaming Corporation which owns the racetrack, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe will cooperate with law enforcement as requested.\u201d",
      "In the past few weeks, ICE has engaged in other large-scale raids across Louisiana. On May 27, the agency raided a federally funded flood-reduction project in New Orleans and reported arresting 15 Central American workers. And the agency said it arrested 10 Chinese nationals working at massage parlors in Baton Rouge during a June 11 raid.",
      "Rachel Taber, an organizer with the Louisiana-based immigrant rights group Uni\u00f3n Migrante, criticized the raids.",
      "\u201cOur economy runs on immigrants,\u201d Taber said. \u201cAnd when we let ourselves be divided by racial hatred, our economy for everyone suffers.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has asked a federal judge to strike down a Kentucky regulation that it says unlawfully provides undocumented students with access to reduced in-state college tuition",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- President Donald Trump's administration has asked a federal judge to strike down a Kentucky regulation that it says unlawfully gives undocumented immigrants access to in-state college tuition.",
      "The U.S. Justice Department's lawsuit says the regulation violates federal immigration law by enabling undocumented students to qualify for the lower tuition rate at Kentucky's public colleges and universities, while American citizens from other states pay higher tuition to attend the same schools.",
      "\u201cFederal law prohibits aliens not lawfully present in the United States from getting in-state tuition benefits that are denied to out-of-state U.S. citizens. There are no exceptions,\" the suit said.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in a federal court in Kentucky, follows a similar action by Trump's administration in another red state as part of its efforts to crack down on immigration.",
      "A federal judge blocked a Texas law that had given college students without legal residency access to reduced in-state tuition. That order only applied to Texas but was seen as an opening for conservatives to challenge similar laws in two dozen states. Such laws were intended to help \u201cDreamers,\u201d or young adults without legal status, to be eligible for in-state tuition if they meet certain residency criteria.",
      "\u201cThe Department of Justice just won on this exact issue in Texas, and we look forward to fighting in Kentucky to protect the rights of American citizens,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuits in both states follow recent executive orders signed by Trump designed to stop any state or local laws or regulations the administration feels discriminate against legal residents.",
      "The Texas suit listed the State of Texas as the defendant but did not name the state's Republican governor as a defendant. The suit in Kentucky names Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear as one of the defendants.",
      "The Kentucky regulation in question appears to have been issued by the state's Council on Postsecondary Education before 2010, Beshear's office said Wednesday in a statement that attempted to separate the governor from the legal fight.",
      "Beshear \u2014 who was first elected governor in 2019 and is now in his second and last term due to term limits \u2014 is widely seen as a potential presidential candidate in 2028.",
      "Beshear spokeswoman Crystal Staley said the governor has no authority to alter the regulations of the education council, or CPE, and should not be a party to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cUnder Kentucky law, CPE is independent, has sole authority to determine student residency requirements for the purposes of in-state tuition and controls its own regulations,\u201d Staley said in the statement.",
      "Beshear in the past has denounced Trump's anti-immigrant language as dangerous and dehumanizing and has called for a balanced approach on immigration: one that protects the nation\u2019s borders but recognizes the role legal immigration plays in meeting business employment needs. Beshear has said he believes that \u201cDreamers\u201d should be able to get full American citizens.",
      "A spokeswoman for CPE, another defendant in the Kentucky case, said Wednesday that its general counsel was reviewing the lawsuit and regulation but had no additional comments.",
      "Kentucky's Republican attorney general, Russell Coleman, said he has \u201cserious concerns\u201d that CPE's policy violates federal law and said his office supports the Trump administration's efforts.",
      "A handful of Republican lawmakers in Kentucky tried to bring up the issue during this year's legislative session but their bill made no headway in the GOP-supermajority legislature. The measure would have blocked immigrants in the state illegally from claiming Kentucky residency for the purpose of paying in-state tuition at a state college or university.",
      "The Justice Department suit says the regulation is in \u201cdirect conflict\u201d with federal law by allowing an undocumented student to qualify for reduced in-state tuition based on residence within the Bluegrass State, while denying that benefit to U.S. citizens who don't meet Kentucky's residency requirements.",
      "Students from other states generally pay higher tuition rates than in-state students to attend Kentucky public colleges, the suit says. Exceptions exist when a reciprocity agreement with another state allows for reduced tuition rates for qualifying students from that other state, it said.",
      "The regulation recognizes undocumented immigrants who graduated from Kentucky high schools as Kentucky residents in conflict with federal law, the suit says.",
      "\u201cIt directly conflicts with federal immigration law\u2019s prohibition on providing postsecondary education benefits \u2014 such as lower tuition rates \u2014 based on residency to aliens not lawfully present in the United States that are not available to all U.S. citizens regardless of residency,\u201d the suit says.",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

      "The data transfer, the senators wrote, posed serious ethical issues and \u201csignificant concerns about possible violations of federal\u201d privacy laws.",

Trump appointees overruled them, giving CMS a 54-minute deadline to share the information with DHS, according to emails obtained by AP.",

      "Schiff and Padilla said the decision by HHS to share the information was \u201ca remarkable departure from established federal privacy protections that should alarm all Americans.\u201d",
      "The senators gave the administration a July 9 deadline to provide to provide copies of communications between the agencies regarding the data transfer, details about the personal information provided to DHS and an accounting for how homeland security officials intend to use it.",

    "summary": "An actor who worked on Tyler Perry's TV series \"The Oval\" has filed a lawsuit accusing Perry of sexual assault and harassment during his time on the show.",
    "story": [
      "Tyler Perry has been accused in a civil lawsuit of repeatedly sexually assaulting and harassing an actor on \"The Oval,\" a TV drama that Perry created, according to a new lawsuit. The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",
      "Matthew Boyd, an attorney representing Perry, denied the allegations in a statement obtained by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,\" the statement said. \"But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\"",
      "Dixon appeared on 85 episodes of \"The Oval,\" which has had a six-season run on the network BET. The actor's most recent appearances came during the latest season of the series earlier this year, according to IMDB. His lawsuit seeks at least $260 million in damages.",
      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It alleges the behavior happened during Dixon's time as a series regular on \"The Oval,\" when Perry \"held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities.\"",
      "The lawsuit, first reported Tuesday by TMZ, says that Perry first noticed Dixon in 2019 when Dixon was part of the event staff at a Perry party, and later offered an audition.",
      "Dixon would first appear in a small role on the Perry series \"Ruthless\" before getting the bigger role on the political drama \"The Oval.\"",
      "Perry soon began sending unwanted sexual text messages to Dixon, according to the lawsuit, which includes alleged screenshots of several of them.",
      "\"What's it going to take for you to have guiltless sex?\" one of the messages says.",
      "The lawsuit claims Perry offered Dixon an increasingly prominent role on the show as his sexual advances became more aggressive.",
      "In the lawsuit, the actor says he tried to remain friendly while maintaining boundaries.",
      "\"Dixon did his best to tiptoe around Mr. Perry's sexual aggression while keeping on Mr. Perry's good side,\" the lawsuit says. \"Mr. Perry made it clear to Dixon that if Dixon ignored Perry or failed to engage with the sexual innuendoes, Dixon's character would 'die.'\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges Perry eventually sexually assaulted Dixon on \"multiple occasions,\" including an instance where he \"forcibly pulled off Mr. Dixon's clothing, groped his buttocks, and attempted to force himself on Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon clearly told Perry \"No,\" but was initially ignored until he was able to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The following day, the suit claims, Perry apologized, and told Dixon he would work with Dixon on a TV pilot Dixon was seeking to produce.",
      "Dixon says he later received a raise that the lawsuit suggests was part of an attempt to keep him quiet.",
      "He said the fear of his character dying kept him quiet as intended.",
      "Perry also produced and bought the rights to the pilot, called \"Losing It,\" but the lawsuit alleges Perry had no intention of selling the show and was using it only for leverage over Dixon.",
      "The lawsuit describes several other alleged assaults. In one of those alleged instances, the suit claims Perry climbed into bed with Dixon, uninvited, and groped him while Dixon was staying in a guest room at Perry's house.",
      "It also alleges that Dixon eventually moved from Atlanta, home to Perry's production studio, to Los Angeles to put distance between the two of them, but \"Mr. Perry continued to sexually harass Mr. Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon in 2024 filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dixon quit the show when its producer's did not take action to investigate his accusations, even after he had filed that complaint with the EEOC.",
      "CBS News and The Associated Press do not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Dixon has.",
      "\"The Oval\" is one of many television series executive produced by, written by and directed by the 55-year-old Perry, who first became known as creator and star of the \"Madea\" films and has since built a major production empire in TV and movies.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/desi-arnaz-singer-husband-dad-and-the-man-who-invented-tv/",
    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 09:29:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",

      "A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the \"Friends\" star's overdose death will plead guilty, according to an agreement filed in court Monday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Perry, 54, was found unresponsive and floating face-down in his jacuzzi on\u00a0Oct. 28, 2023, according to\u00a0an autopsy report\u00a0from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",

      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",

    "summary": "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two measles vaccine doses, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "Colorado says many of its vaccinated cases have been in residents who were exposed during travel to other parts of the world facing large outbreaks like Canada and Europe.",
      "The state previously said it had linked multiple cases to an infectious traveler who exposed others at Denver International Airport and on a Turkish Airlines flight.",
      "The CDC has\u00a0issued new guidance\u00a0for summer camps to prepare for the threat of measles spread this year, including urging camp operators to check for documentation of immunity among staff and children.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

      "\"You're basically saying to a family, it's going to be a $1,000 a month or more to get to and from work, to get to and from school,\" Manzo said. \"It's not cheap.\" \u00a0 The costs may not be as high in some other states as in California. But nationwide, taking into account inflation, the financial burden of transportation is steadily rising, along with housing and childcare, United Way analysis has found.",
      "Manzo says that advising families in California to move somewhere more affordable isn't necessarily a practical solution.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, marking a continuation of its \"wait-and-see\" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies.",
      "The central bank also expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, but it still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as it projected in March.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference to discuss the rate decision.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The rate has remained at that level since President Trump took office in January. The last time the Fed cut rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "When determining rate cuts, the Fed's goal is to keep inflation low and maintain a healthy job market. In its announcement\u00a0Wednesday, the central bank mentioned solid labor market conditions and an economy that continues to grow at a \"solid pace\" although it also signaled caution.",
      "\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated,\" the Fed wrote in its announcement.",
      "At the Wednesday press conference, Powell underscored the relative strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions including the 4.2% unemployment rate, a low inflation rate and improvements in business and consumer sentiment. But he added that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth in the economy this year.",
      "In its latest\u00a0quarterly projections\u00a0for the economy and interest rates, the Fed said it expects that inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will pick up to 3% by year end. The central bank also expects unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%, up from the current 4.2%.",
      "\"The thing that every outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4% in May, still above the Fed's target rate of 2%. There has been speculation that Mr. Trump's tariffs could drive up inflation, but so far it has largely remained in check.",
      "Powell said that he expect the Fed will learn a \"great deal more\" on tariffs over the summer and that the developments will inform their thinking moving forward. In the meantime, the Fed Chair said the central bank is well positioned to hold off on rate cuts. \"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" he said.",
      "More tariff changes are expected in the coming months. President Trump's 90-day-pause on reciprocal tariffs ends July 9.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "Fed officials said they predict two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, in keeping with what they projected in March, but did not specify when future cuts might happen.",
      "\"What we're waiting for to reduce rates is to understand what will happen with the tariff inflation,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Others, meanwhile, are betting a rate reduction will come in September. Economists give a roughly 60% probability that the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate at its September 17 meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "But analysts also remain cautious in their predictions. \"If the June and July inflation measures remain tepid \u2014 and especially if the labor market starts to show signs of weakness \u2014 that could have investors wondering if the Fed may consider a cut at its July 29-30 meeting,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What does this mean for your money?",
      "The federal funds rate reflects the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans. A higher benchmark rate can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers because it helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "When the benchmark rate is lowered, loan rates tend to follow, making it less expensive to borrow money.",
      "With the Fed keeping rates steady, it's unlikely that borrowers will see near-term relief on their lending costs.",
      "\"This is music to the ears of savers, like retirees, that are earning good income on their hard-earned savings,\" said Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email. \"But it underscores the urgency for borrowers to aggressively pay down high-cost credit card debt and offers little hope of a significant drop in interest rates any time soon.\"",
      "What has President Trump said about interest rates?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to slash rates, including on Wednesday morning before the Fed announced its decision. During remarks to the press, Mr. Trump called out Powell, saying he's \"done a poor job.\"",
      "\"We had the highest inflation we ever had and then it came down when I got elected,\" he said. \"Now we have a man who refuses to lower the Fed rate.\"",

      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a 19% cut to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Medicare's outlook",
      "Separately, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued a report Wednesday that said the health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.",
      "Instead, the program's revenues would only cover 89% of its costs at that point, the report said.",
      "\"Medicare provides essential coverage for millions of American seniors, but this year's report underscores the urgent need for serious, sustained reform to secure its long-term future,\" CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement.",

      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",

      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",

      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",

      "The benchmark interest rate has been at its current range since December.",
      "The Fed has held off on cutting rates since President Trump took office, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, most recently this month, after a new employment report showed job creation slowed in May.",
      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",

      "When is the FOMC meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",

      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",

Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",

      "The company will also issue a \"golden share\" to the U.S. government, which will give the president the power to approve or veto a number of major corporate decisions, and gives the U.S. government the right to appoint one independent director.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has ignored a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "At Home's court filings reveal fissures in the company's finances. At Home shuttered six stores in the last year, according to the company's Chapter 11 filing. And some macroeconomic factors like inflation and tariffs have placed \"significant pressure\" on its revenue, the company said.",

      "The voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings are taking place at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the company said in its\u00a0statement.

      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0executive order\u00a0on Friday clearing the way for Japan-based Nippon Steel to potentially buy U.S. Steel comes with an unusual corporate twist called a \"golden share.\"",
      "As part of the agreement, Mr. Trump will gain power to approve a number of major corporate decisions for the company, signaling that the president could potentially block the company from relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, or transferring or relocating jobs outside the U.S.",
      "The details of the golden share were disclosed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday in a social media post, where he described the agreement as including \"powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel.\"",
      "What is a golden share?",
      "A \"golden share\" refers to special rights held by a government over a corporate entity. They are typically granted in relation to newly privatized businesses over which the government wants to maintain some control,\u00a0according to legal research company Westlaw.",
      "Golden shares have been employed in countries ranging from the U.K. to China, although they are rare in the U.S. In the former case, the U.K. government held a golden share in the British Airports Authority, although it was ruled illegal by a court in 2003. In the latter, the Communist Party had taken a percentage ownership in private companies as well as control over government board seats and voting power, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported in 2023.",
      "While presidents can indirectly influence corporate decisions through agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers for antitrust concerns, it's unusual for a commander-in-chief to exercise the level of control outlined by Lutnick regarding U.S. Steel. According to his post, U.S. Steel \u2014 which would keep its name and headquarters after the merger \u2014 also wouldn't be allowed to change its name from U.S. Steel without President Trump's approval.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent three directors and can veto the other two choices, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"The Art of the Deal,\" Lutnick wrote of the agreement, referencing Mr. Trump's best-selling book about his business skills and negotiating techniques.",
      "Terms remain unclear",
      "Lutnick described the golden share in the U.S. Steel deal as \"perpetual.\" The Commerce Department didn't return a request for clarification on if the golden share would transfer to subsequent presidents after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The full terms also remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel nor the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Friday, the two companies\u00a0announced in a joint statement\u00a0that they had agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement. They added the terms mandate $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "The U.S. Steelworkers union told CBS MoneyWatch that it can't comment on the golden shares without seeing more information about the agreement. But it pointed to a June 15 statement that expressed the union's disappointment with the president's decision to move forward with the merger.",
      "\"Details matter: Neither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\" the union letter said. \"And, while there is a claimed 'golden share,' what can we expect from Nippon's leadership in Japan which continues to build up overcapacity in steel globally and has been charged again with dumping by the Department of Commerce just weeks ago?\"",

After scoring cities across these metrics, WalletHub then compared the data against each city's per-capita budget to determine which are run the best.",
      "\"The best-run cities in America use their budgets most effectively to provide high-quality financial security, education, health, safety and transportation to their residents,\" said Chip Lupo, a WalletHub analyst, wrote in the study. \"Many of the top cities also have a very low amount of outstanding government debt per capita, which can prevent financial troubles in the future.\"",
      "Read on to find out where your city falls on WalletHub's list.",
      "What are the best-run cities?",
      "Provo, Utah, ranks as the best-run city in the U.S., according to the WalletHub study. Home to 115,000 people, the western city is probably best known for its towering mountains and as the birthplace of Brigham Young University.",
      "A constellation of factors pushed Provo to the top of the list, including its robust business growth (5.2%), impressive high school graduation rate (91%), infrastructure and safety ratings, with it the fourth-lowest violent crime rate in the country. The nation's average high school graduation rate stands at 87%.",
      "Trailing Provo at number two and number three are Nampa, Idaho, which stands out due to its low government debt and safety ratings, and Manchester, New Hampshire, respectively. The latter notched points for low pollution levels and steady growth in home values.",
      "Here are the best and worst-run cities, as ranked by WalletHub. You can also search for your city by name in the bar at the top of the chart.",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:12:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled that Tennessee's law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth does not violate the 14th Amendment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a decision that is likely to have broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth in half of the country.",
      "In the case of U.S. v. Skrmetti, the high court ruled 6-3 to reject the challenge brought by the Biden administration, three families and a physician who had argued that Tennessee's law violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The court concluded that the state's measure, which is known as SB1 and was enacted in 2023, does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.",
      "The court's majority found that Tennessee's law is not subject to a heightened level of judicial review and satisfies the most deferential standard, known as rational basis.",
      "\"We are asked to decide whether SB1 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"We hold it is not. SB1 does not classify on the bases that warrant heightened review.\"",
      "The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent. Sotomayor read her opinion from the bench, saying \"in sadness, I dissent.\"",
      "The court, Sotomayor wrote, \"obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.\"",
      "Joined by Kagan and Jackson, she continued: \"The court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"",
      "The Tennessee law",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. The state is one of 25 with laws that seek to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first in which the Supreme Court stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth. In addition to the state prohibitions, President Trump has issued executive orders that address what he calls \"gender ideology.\" One declares that it is the federal government's policy to recognize \"two sexes, male and the female,\" and the second threatens federal funding for medical institutions that offer gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 18.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposals are being challenged in the federal courts.",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's law prevents health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Shortly before the law took effect, three families with transgender children and a physician who provides the treatments to patients with gender dysphoria challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened in the case.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status. A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued.",
      "The appeals court evaluated the law under rational-basis review, the most deferential of the tiers of judicial scrutiny. But the Biden administration and the families had argued Tennessee's ban should be subject to a more stringent level of review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it draws lines based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "But Tennessee had argued that the state aims to protect young people from the consequences of the medical treatments, which it said are risky and unproven. The state said it was setting age- and use-based limits on medical care and exercising its authority to regulate medicine.",
      "Access to gender-affirming care has become a flashpoint in the culture wars, as half of the states have in recent years enacted laws that limit the availability of the medical interventions. Many of those same states have also enacted measures prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.",
      "\"Today's landmark ruling by the Supreme Court is a victory for our Constitution, the rule of law, and common sense. Elected representatives have the right \u2014 and obligation \u2014 to protect children from falling victim to irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation,\" Liz Huston, White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \"President Trump will continue to speak out and take action to protect innocent American children from these barbaric procedures that are based on junk science.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision, which she said allows states to protect children.",
      "\"This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect America's children and parental rights. I encourage other states to follow Tennessee's lead and enact similar legislation to protect our kids,\" she said in a statement shared on social media.",
      "The court's decision",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority found that Tennessee's law classifies on the basis of age and medical use, since treatments like puberty blockers and hormones can be administered to treat certain conditions, but not gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder or gender incongruence.",
      "Classifications that turn on age or medical use are subject only to rational-basis review, the least demanding level of judicial review, it said.",
      "\"Under SB1, no minor may be administered puberty blockers or hormones to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence; minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other purposes,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The majority said that Tennessee had \"plausible reasons\" for restricting access to gender-affirming care that brought its inquiry over the law's constitutionality to an end, namely concerns about the health risks. The justices said they wouldn't second-guess the legislature over the lines that the ban draws.",
      "\"Recent developments only underscore the need for legislative flexibility in this area,\" Roberts wrote, pointing to a report from England's National Health Service that evaluated the evidence regarding the use of puberty blockers and hormones and characterized it as \"remarkably weak.\"",
      "\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" he wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.\"",
      "Roberts concluded that the court's role is only to ensure that the law does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas, Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito all issued separate concurring opinions to express their views on the case.",
      "Thomas said the dispute serves as a reminder that the American people and their elected officials can disagree with experts on questions of \"controversial medical questions,\" and courts should not sit as a \"super-legislature.\"",
      "\"The ongoing debate over the efficacy of sex-transition treatments for children confirms that medical and regulatory authorities are not of one mind about the treatments' risks and benefits,\" he wrote. \"These conditions illustrate why states may rightly be skeptical of groups or advocates claiming that expert consensus supports their position, and why courts must exercise restraint in reviewing state legislatures' decisions in this area.\"",
      "Barrett, meanwhile, wrote that the question of how to regulate a medical condition like gender dysphoria involves policy judgments that legislatures, not courts, are best positioned to make. She noted that transgender status implicates other areas that have been subject to regulation by states, including access to restrooms and transgender athletes' eligibility for sports teams. If those laws are subject to a more stringent level of scrutiny, courts will then be forced to scrutinize those legislative choices, she warned.",
      "\"But legislatures have many valid reasons to make policy in these areas, and so long as a statute is a rational means of pursuing a legitimate end, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied,\" she wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Thomas.",
      "The dissent",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that Tennessee's law discriminates against transgender adolescents and conditions the availability of medications on the patient's sex. In subjecting the law to rational-basis review, Sotomayor accused the majority of \"retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most\" and abandoning \"transgender children and their families to political whims.\"",
      "She said that the lower court should have evaluated the law under intermediate scrutiny because it draws lines on the basis of sex, and accused the majority of skirting its obligation to take a closer look at the ban.",
      "Sotomayor argued that there is a history of discrimination against transgender people in health care, employment and housing, and pointed to Mr. Trump's recent directives as evidence \u2014 namely his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect for now, and executive order seeking to ensure federal grant dollars do not promote what he calls \"gender ideology.\"",
      "She accused the majority of rendering \"transgender Americans doubly vulnerable to state-sanctioned discrimination,\" and said the high court could have ordered the 6th Circuit to apply the more stringent standard of review without wading into scientific and policy debates over the safety of medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Yet the majority inexplicably refuses to take even the modest step of requiring Tennessee to show its work before the lower courts,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, which represented the transgender adolescents and their families, lamented the Supreme Court's decision as a loss for transgender youth.",
      "\"Today's ruling is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution,\" said Chase Strangio, a co-director of the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project who participated in arguments before the Supreme Court. \"Though this is a painful setback, it does not mean that transgender people and our allies are left with no options to defend our freedom, our health care, or our lives.\"",

    "story": [
      "An interview between Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz about Israel's military campaign against Iran became contentious when the ex-Fox News host quizzed the Texas Republican about Iran \u2014 highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies.",
      "The back-and-forth hinged on Cruz's backing of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration has stated the U.S. is not directly involved in the offensive, but it has helped Israel defend against Iranian counterattacks, and Mr. Trump has weighed conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Carlson \u2014 a vocal skeptic of military intervention \u2014 questioned the premise of joining a war with Iran and criticized Cruz for saying he would like the Iranian regime to be toppled, saying to Cruz at one point: \"You don't know anything about Iran.\"",
      "One of the most contentious exchanges in the two-hour interview \u2014 which was released in full on X Wednesday \u2014 came when Carlson asked Cruz what Iran's population is. Cruz said he wasn't sure.",
      "\"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\" Carlson asked.",
      "\"I don't sit around memorizing population tables,\" Cruz retorted.",
      "The host then followed up by asking Cruz about Iran's demographics. When Cruz said they were Persians, predominantly Shia Muslims, Carlson asked him for the percentage, frustrating the Texas senator.",
      "\"Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,\" Cruz said.",
      "The two Trump supporters also argued about whether Iran has sought to assassinate Mr. Trump, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged last week. Federal prosecutors last year\u00a0announced charges against an Iranian asset, accusing him of plotting to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz cited the alleged assassination plots while criticizing Iran's leadership, but Carlson questioned why the senator hadn't instead supported immediate U.S. military action if he believed Iran has tried to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz, meanwhile, suggested Carlson at one point has a \"weird \u2026 obsession with Israel\" when Carlson asked about support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Carlson said he interpreted the comment as an accusation of antisemitism, which Cruz denied.",
      "\"You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to overthrow, and you're calling me reckless,\" Carlson said late in the interview.",
      "\"I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons that could kill millions of Americans. You say 'I can't see how that benefits America in any way.' That is bizarre,\" Cruz responded.",
      "The sparring continued on social media, with Cruz accusing Carlson of \"playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran\" and mocking the question about Iran's size.",
      "The bitter exchange reflects a wider divide among Mr. Trump's backers on how involved the U.S. should get in the Israel-Iran conflict. The president has long criticized foreign intervention, but has also supported pressuring Iran.",
      "Mr. Trump's closest advisers have not reached agreement on whether the president should strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CBS News has reported.",
      "Some Republicans, in addition to Cruz, have backed a hardline policy against Iran and are open to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iran. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0told CBS News over the weekend he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but if that fails, he urged Mr. Trump \"to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program.\"",
      "During the interview, Cruz told Carlson he doesn't support sending U.S. troops into Iran, but told reporters Wednesday the president \"could quite reasonably make the decision\" to bomb Iran's subterranean nuclear site at\u00a0Fordo.",
      "But other Trump allies are wary of intervention. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Carlson in an interview he views stopping \"forever wars\" as a core MAGA tenet, and suggested U.S. involvement in Iran could \"blow up the coalition\" and harm Mr. Trump's domestic priorities. Still, Bannon told reporters Wednesday he thinks \"the vast majority of the MAGA movement\" would trust Mr. Trump's judgment if he decides striking Iran is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of congressional Republicans have called for a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from taking military action on Iran without congressional approval.",
      "It's unclear how the president will proceed, though he downplayed the idea of an intra-MAGA rift over Iran on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"my supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them.\"",
      "The president also repeatedly lashed out at Carlson on Monday, before the Cruz interview was released. The president called him \"kooky\" in a Truth Social post, and seemed to mock Carlson over his ouster from Fox News.",
      "\"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",

      "There's disagreement among Mr. Trump's close advisers about taking direct action along with Israel, CBS News' sources said Tuesday, but the U.S. military has sent additional warplanes from their home bases to Europe, which analysts believe could be preparation for a greater role in the Mideast.",
      "CBS News' partner network BBC News said Tuesday that its own analysis of flight tracking data had verified at least 30 American military aircraft flying from bases in the U.S. to Europe over the previous three days - all tanker aircraft used to re-fuel fighter jets and bombers. Data from the Flightradar24 tracking website showed at least seven of the planes - all KC-135 Stratotankers - had stopped at U.S. bases in Spain, Scotland and England.",

    "summary": "About six years ago, Boelter was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. But what exactly does being appointed to that board mean?",
    "story": [
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is in the Sherburne County Jail on Tuesday in Elk River, Minnesota, facing several federal and state charges for the shootings that killed a state representative and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife.",
      "Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot inside their Brooklyn Park home overnight Saturday. About 90 minutes before that, police say Boelter shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans were struck multiple times and are still recovering.",
      "About six years ago, Boelter was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. But what exactly does being appointed to that board mean?",
      "What we know about Boelter's appointment on workforce board",
      "State records show Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the development board, first appointed by\u00a0then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016. Three years later, Walz reappointed him.",
      "A spokesperson for Walz's office gave this statement to WCCO on Tuesday:",
      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",
      "According to the development board's website, it \"represents key leaders from business, education, labor, community-based organizations, and government,\" with the board providing \"a venue for workforce stakeholders building on a shared vision and mission.\"",
      "Boelter's expertise was rooted in his work as a general manager at a Speedway gas station.",
      "During Boelter's second term, which ended in January 2023, he served alongside Sen. John Hoffman. It's unclear at this point if the two worked closely.",
      "David Schultz, political science professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, says under state law, the governor appoints hundreds of people to dozens of boards across the state, ranging in topics as disparate as amateur sports, mosquito control and tourism.",
      "Schultz says appointees are unpaid and the state's boards are more technical than political, with bipartisan appointments and, essentially, citizen volunteers. The governor's role, according to Schultz, is more ceremonial.",
      "\"They're not vetted or reviewed personally by the governor. In many cases, this is done as it should be, by subordinates, you know, who then bring to the governor the recommendations,\" Schultz said. \"And this is no different than what we would find in business and industry, where we don't expect the president of most companies to be involved in the hiring for every position.\"",
      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",
      "U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, who was previously lieutenant governor under Dayton and also served as his chief of staff, echoed Schultz that governors don't directly choose board appointments.",
      "\"Those workforce training councils or groups are very much not political, and the governor would often appoint people to those committees that they did not know personally, but were recommended by industry groups,\" she said in an interview with WCCO.",
      "FBI: Boelter extensively planned attacks, researched his victims",
      "The FBI says Boelter extensively planned and researched his victims. Inside his SUV left outside the Hortmans' home, police found high-powered guns and ammunition.",
      "They also found pages of handwritten notebooks with the names of more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public officials. Melissa Hortman's name was on that list, according to authorities, with her home address written next to her name.",
      "Boelter also visited the homes of two other lawmakers early Saturday. Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, confirmed on Tuesday that she was home, but Boelter was allegedly scared away after a police officer pulled up to his vehicle. Rest said she's grateful for the heroic work of the New Hope Police Department, whose \"quick action saved my life.\"",
      "Rep. Kristen Bahner, DFL-Maple Grove, confirmed on Wednesday she too had been targeted but was not at home, citing \"divine intervention\" that led her family to change their plans.",
      "\"This senseless violence came to my door as well, placing me and my family in harm's way,\" Bahner said. \"I do not know why this man was filled with such hatred that he would come to my door.\"",
      "There is a security debate amongst legislators at the Minnesota State Capitol\u00a0because the building, much like other state capitols, doesn't have metal detectors or security screenings at its various points of entry.",

      "Hashmi is the first Muslim and the first Indian-American to be nominated to appear on the ballot for a Virginia statewide office. She defeated five other candidates, including Democrat Levar Stoney by less than a percentage point, to secure the nomination in a razor-thin primary race. Stoney congratulated Hashmi on Wednesday in a concession statement.",

Abigail Spanberger, the nominee for governor, said in a joint statement Wednesday morning.",
      "Virginia's off-year elections typically draw national attention as a possible bellwether for politicians as they head into midterms in 2026. And this year, the election is also sure to make history.",
      "Spanberger, who ran for the Democratic nomination unopposed, will battle Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor's race. The female nominees all but guarantee that Virginia will have a woman for governor, which is a first in the state's some 250-year history dating back to Patrick Henry's governorship.",
      "On Wednesday, Spanberger's campaign announced a new advertisement emphasizing her biography.",
      "Conservatives did not hold statewide primaries this year, with only one candidate in each statewide contest advancing to the general election ballot.",
      "Earle-Sears became the Republican gubernatorial nominee after conservatives Dave LaRock and Amanda Chase failed to collect enough signatures to qualify for the ballot. Both LaRock and Chase initially challenged Earle-Sears for not being fully aligned with the White House.",
      "Reid, a conservative talk-radio host, secured the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor despite intraparty quarreling over whether he was tied to a social media account reposting pornography, a charge he vehemently denied.",
      "Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares sailed to his spot on the ballot after announcing his reelection bid.",
      "Roughly 481,000 votes have been counted so far in the lieutenant governor's Democratic primary, and about 479,000 in the contest for attorney general.",
      "The races appear to be on track to match Democratic turnout for the statewide primary in 2021. But in that election, a wide field of candidates vying for governor was on the ballot. With Spanberger as the nominee, only Hashmi and Jones faced contested statewide primaries.",
      "Hashmi's political career has been marked by its fair share of firsts: she was the first Muslim woman and the first South Asian American in Virginia's upper chamber.",
      "She emigrated from India to Georgia when she was four years old, later moving to Richmond after getting a doctorate in American literature. She spent most of her career as a professor, first at the University of Richmond and then at Reynolds Community College.",
      "The Democrat managed to distinguish herself by touting her legislative chops. Hashmi began her career in the Virginia Senate six years ago after ousting incumbent Republican Sen. Glen Sturtevant. She was reelected to her seat in 2023.",
      "In the Senate, Hashmi put forth bills establishing Virginians' right to contraception, which passed both chambers but were vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",

      "On Tuesday night, some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle moved to limit Mr. Trump's ability to order U.S. strikes on Iran, on the grounds that many past presidents have found ways to avoid asking for congressional authority to declare war, although the Constitution confers Congress with the power to declare war.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday explicitly said he's considering joining Israel in strikes on Iran, telling reporters, \"I may do it, I may not do it, nobody knows what I'm going to do.\"",

      "Initially the Trump administration maintained that the U.S. was not involved and that Israel was acting unilaterally. But now, Mr. Trump is considering joining Israel in potential strikes against Iran's nuclear sites, including the secretive Fordo nuclear enrichment facility. The site is buried deep under a mountain, and military experts say Israel would need U.S. warplanes to drop so-called \"bunker-buster\" bombs to penetrate the facility.",
      "Mr. Trump on Tuesday called for \"unconditional surrender\" by Iran's clerical rulers and threatened Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, saying the U.S. knew where he was but would not kill him \u2014\u00a0 \"at least not for now.\" The president added, \"Our patience is wearing thin.\"",

The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",

Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a challenge brought by Texas and a group of landowners to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at a facility in the state.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a decision for a 6-3 court in the case of NRC v. Texas\t that neither Texas nor a land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding, and therefore are not entitled to obtain judicial review. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.",
      "The court reversed a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that allowed the case to move forward and ordered the lower court to deny or dismiss the petitions for review filed by Texas and the landowners. It did not address a second matter raised in the dispute regarding whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite.",
      "\"In short, the Hobbs Act affords judicial review to those who were parties before the commission. Here, obtaining party status required Texas or Fasken to successfully intervene in the commission proceeding,\" Kavanaugh wrote for the six-justice majority. \"Because neither Texas nor Fasken successfully intervened, they may not obtain judicial review of the commission's licensing decision under the Hobbs Act.\"",
      "The Hobbs Act is a 1950 law that dictates when a \"party aggrieved\" by an agency's final order can seek review from a federal appeals court.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress enacted a law requiring the federal government to establish a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel. Yucca Mountain in Nevada was later selected to house this repository.",
      "But the site hasn't yet been established amid pushback from the state, and the project was halted during the Obama administration. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will seek to restart the Yucca Mountain project.",
      "The issue of where to put the increasing amount of spent fuel remains. More than 90,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently privately stored, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the Government Accountability Office. Plants continue to generate an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, as nearly 20% of the nation's electricity is supplied by nuclear energy, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "Spent fuel from a nuclear reactor can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years,\u00a0according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "In September 2021, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a license to a company called Interim Storage Partners that allowed it to store 5,000 metric tons, and up to 40,000 metric tons, of nuclear waste in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be built in Andrews County, Texas, located west of Dallas and near the New Mexico border. The area is already home to a disposal site for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the storage site and warned against housing spent nuclear fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above Texas' Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the nation's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality did not try to intervene during the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But other groups did try to object, including a company that owns land in the Permian Basin, though its request was denied by the commission.",
      "The state and landowners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the government's license to Interim Storage Partners, and the court allowed the legal battle to proceed. The 5th Circuit also ruled that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not have the authority to issue a license that let nuclear waste to be held at privately owned facilities offsite from where the spent fuel was generated.",
      "Whether the commission could allow private companies to temporarily store nuclear waste was only one part of the dispute before the Supreme Court. The first, key issue for the justices to weigh was whether Texas and landowners who challenged the license to Interim Storage Partners could do so in the first place, since they didn't intervene at an earlier stage in the licensing process.",
      "The high court determined that Texas and the landowners could not seek judicial review of the commission's decision to issue Interim Storage Partners its license. Still, Kavanaugh noted that \"history and precedent\" offer support for the commission's interpretation that the Atomic Energy Act allows spent nuclear fuel to be stored offsite at private facilities.",
      "\"To be clear, because Texas and Fasken's claims are not judicially reviewable, we need not and do not decide the ultimate question of statutory authority that the dissent focuses on,\" he wrote for the six-justice majority. \"So that there is no confusion, however, we underscore that in resting on the threshold reviewability issue, we are not somehow assuming or buying into a premise that the commission is wrong on the underlying merits.\"",
      "Writing in dissent, Gorsuch, joined by Thomas and Alito, said that the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners was unlawful. Accepting the commission's argument that Texas and Fasken could not seek review of its licensing decision \"requires us to ignore the full scope of the agency's own licensing proceeding,\" he wrote.",
      "Gorsuch continued: \"It forces us to reimagine a statute expanding public access to the agency's administrative proceedings into one restricting access. And it asks us to believe that the very state in which the agency intends to store spent nuclear fuel indefinitely cannot be heard in court to complain about the agency's plans. Because nothing in the law requires us to indulge any of those fantasies, I respectfully dissent. \"",

    "summary": "NYC Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE agents Tuesday at immigration court in Manhattan.",
    "story": [
      "New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested Tuesday by masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents inside federal immigration court in Lower Manhattan.",
      "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and\u00a0impeding a federal officer.",
      "He was released several hours later. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the charges against him were dropped.",
      "Lander's office said he was taken into custody by ICE agents while observing court. He has been attending immigration hearings for the past several weeks to observe and, by his own account, help escort people out of court so they aren't arrested by ICE.",
      "\"While escorting a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, Brad was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE,\" Dora Pekec, Lander's campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "Video from the courthouse, shot by a member of Lander's staff, showed him being placed into handcuffs. A furious Lander could be heard telling agents that they had no right to cuff him.",
      "\"You don't have the authority to arrest U.S. citizens asking for a judicial warrant,\" he could be heard saying during his arrest.",
      "A spokesperson for the Southern District of New York said it is continuing to investigate the incident.",
      "\"The safety and security of official proceedings, government officials, law enforcement officers, and all members of the public who participate in them is a core focus of our office,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Under federal law, assaults on law enforcement or other public officials, destruction of property and obstruction of official proceedings are all prohibited.",
      "\"Our heroic ICE law enforcement officers face a 413% increase in assaults against them \u2014 it is wrong that politicians seeking higher office undermine law enforcement safety to get a viral moment. No one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.",
      "Lander speaks out after ICE arrest",
      "\"I'm happy to report I am just fine. I lost a button,\" Lander joked after he was released. \"But I'm going to sleep in my bed tonight, safe with my family. I'm grateful to hear that the charges are not being brought. But if they are, I've got a lawyer. I don't have to worry about my due process rights. At that elevator, I was separated from someone named Edgardo, who I had just met a couple of minutes earlier. Edgardo is in ICE detention, and he's not going to sleep in his bed tonight. So far as I know, he has no lawyer. He has been stripped of his due process rights by a government and a judge that owe him a credible fear hearing before they deport him, and yet have decided instead to strip folks like Edgardo. So I will be fine, but Edgardo is not going to be fine, and the rule of law is not fine, and our constitutional democracy is not fine.\"",
      "Lander said he had accompanied four families out of prior hearings \"all of whom were afraid they were going to be detained by ICE agents.\"",
      "CBS News New York's Ali Bauman later asked Lander why he thinks he was arrested.",
      "\"Donald Trump is coming for New York City. He's coming for our immigration neighbors, trying to ratchet up fear. That's how creeping authoritarianism works,\" Lander said.",
      "\"It was important for me to go down there and stand up for... for the rule of law and due process in New York City,\" he added. \"And apparently, that is not what the Trump administration wants people to do.\"",
      "Lander's arrest followed the arrest of California Sen. Alex Padilla at a Homeland Security press conference last week, and the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an ICE facility last month.",
      "Bauman asked Lander what message is being sent when people see politicians arrested.",
      "\"[Attorney General] Pam Bondi has made it clear what they're doing. They're going after the leaders of Democratic cities with a political intention of provoking conflict,\" Lander said.",
      "Hochul calls it a \"sorry day for New York and for our country\"",
      "The governor also spoke out after Lander was released.",
      "\"This is a sorry day for New York and our country,\" Hochul said. \"The video is shocking. I knew I needed to come down here immediately [to] check on [his] whereabouts and do what I could to intervene.\"",
      "Hochul went on to say, \"We're a better country than this. A far better country than what we're experiencing. This is New York. This is New York, a land of immigrants. We're proud of them. As I stood in the hallway upstairs on the ninth floor waiting to know the whereabouts of my friend, almost everyone I spoke to who worked there in security and otherwise, they came from other countries. They're immigrants, themselves. Don't forget that.\"",
      "A spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement, \"Today should not be about Brad Lander.\"",
      "\"It's about making sure all New Yorkers \u2014 regardless of their documentation status \u2014 feel safe enough to use public resources, like dialing 911, sending their kids to school, going to the hospital, or attending court appearances, and do not instead hide in the shadows,\" the statement continued.",
      "\"ICE arresting Brad Lander for asking questions is a stunning abuse of power and a threat to our democracy. Arresting a public official, the duly-elected comptroller of the City of New York, for asking questions is dangerous intimidation and shows a wanton disregard for the will of the people of New York. It sends an unmistakably authoritarian message \u2014 that ICE doesn't care about the rule of law and that anyone exercising their right to challenge ICE and speak up for immigrants will be punished,\" ACLU of New York Executive Director Donna Lieberman said. \"All elected officials and candidates for office should condemn this arrest in the strongest terms and stand up for New Yorkers.\"",
      "\"This is an abomination. The violence that you witness from a sitting citywide official who's simply standing to bear witness [to] what is happening to other humans, that violence you saw him experience, just imagine what they do to people who are less well known,\" said New York City Councilmember Alex Avil\u00e9s.",
      "\"What I saw today was not the rule of law,\" Lander's wife says",
      "Lander's wife, Meg Barnette, held an earlier news conference outside the courthouse, saying she was with him when he was arrested.",
      "\"I joined him today, because this is the third time that he has done court watching here, and I have been moved and horrified and found his stories very compelling, and I wanted to be here with him to witness for myself,\" Barnette said. \"What I saw was shocking and unacceptable and not in accordance \u2014 I am an attorney. I haven't practiced law in a while, but I sure know that what I saw today was not the rule of law. That was not due process, and the way people are being treated is absolutely unacceptable in this city and this country.\"",
      "She told reporters Lander and other advocates had repeatedly asked to see the judicial warrant and grounds for deportation and they were linking arms with the person at the center of the hearing, whom he later identified as Edgardo.",
      "\"We're surrounding the individual, locking arms. We asked \u2014 I was part of the group \u2014 and we asked numerous times for the warrant, for their names, for their badge numbers. It was unclear what agency they were from, they're in full uniform, in many cases, with a mask pulled up over the bridge of their nose,\" said Barnette. \"So Brad, I assume, was saying, 'I am an American citizen, I am asking you for the judicial warrant, you do not have grounds to arrest me.'\"",
      "Lander has been going to immigration court on separate occasions for several weeks after a number of undocumented immigrants, including a Bronx public school student named Dylan, were arrested by masked ICE agents after showing up to routine hearings.",
      "Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined the news conference and said, \"Thank you to Brad Lander.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, all the power we have is to be present and to witness what is happening. And everyone of any moral character, any moral consciousness will be thanking Brad Lander for being that witness and using what he could where he was with what he had to try to help someone,\" Williams said. \"What is happening in this country, what is happening in that building is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Lander's rabbi was also at the courthouse as an observer and spoke during the news conference.",
      "\"I share the public advocate's view that I have never been as proud of him as I am today, and I've known him in many situations,\" said Rabbi Ellen Lippmann. \"I have never been as ashamed to be an American or a New Yorker as I feel today, except for the uprising from all the incredible New Yorkers who represent the good and the true and the right in this city.\"",
      "What advocates allege is happening in immigration court",
      "Barnette described seeing multiple cases where the person is told that their case is dismissed and they have 30 days to appeal, but said they were then met by agents waiting for them in the hallway.",
      "\"What I saw happen, repeatedly, there and what I understand from other stories has continued to happen is that these folks have pending asylum cases, they are told, 'Your case is dismissed.' That sounds like good news. It is not good news. What that means is that you are subject to immediate removal when you leave the courtroom,\" she explained. \"And the ICE agents are lining the hallway, and that is not explained to people.\"",
      "\"They are kidnapping our neighbors off of the street. They are bamboozling them, they are tricking them to tell them to come here and something good will happen. And when they hear the court news, they believe something good has happened. And then they're faced with people in fatigues, with masks on their faces, and they're taken, having not understood even what just happened legally and what their recourse is,\" added Williams. \"That is something that we all have to stand up against.\"",

      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger is emphasizing her life and career as she aims to become the next governor of Virginia at a time when her national party is searching for answers on how to win over voters after an election cycle filled with setbacks.",
      "The Spanberger campaign's new advertisement for the general election, first reported by CBS News, shows her reflecting on the various kinds of hallways she's walked through, starting with her education at Virginia's J.R. Tucker High School, before quickly pivoting to the CIA, where she was a case officer, and then to the Capitol, where she was a bipartisan-minded U.S. House representative.",
      "\"As governor, I'll work to lower costs and make sure our schools prepare all our kids for jobs of the future,\" Spanberger said in the advertisement.",
      "According to the campaign, the advertisement is set to run in the Norfolk and Richmond markets along with digital platforms.",
      "The messaging approach comes as Spanberger prepares to try and introduce herself to a wider range of voters with less than five months to go before this fall's off year election. Before running for governor, Spanberger served three terms in Congress after unseating a Republican incumbent in the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "Over the last 25 years, Virginia has shifted from backing Republicans in presidential elections to Democrats. That has not been the case in races for governor however, with the office shifting back and forth between the two major parties over the same period of time.",
      "The state's gubernatorial contests, which take place in the off year after presidential elections, have long been viewed as political bellwethers, with voters typically favoring a governor from the party opposite the president. That pattern has held in nearly every presidential election since 1980, from Ronald Reagan to Joe Biden. Most recently, Republican Glenn Youngkin's 2021 victory was seen as an early warning sign for Democrats ahead of their midterm challenges.",
      "Strategists from both parties see this year's outcome as a test of the national mood \u2014 and of messaging on key issues ranging from abortion, crime and education to the economy and immigration.",
      "Youngkin's 2021 victory over then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when backlash against Democrats during the early days of the Biden administration appeared to energize Republican voters. Under Virginia law, a governor cannot serve for two consecutive terms, which has resulted in open races for the office without the advantage of incumbency.",
      "Virginia GOP Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is running to be Youngkin's successor, is facing both a challenging national political climate in her attempt to keep the governor's office under Republican control during the second Trump administration and a notable local dynamic. Republicans haven't won two straight races for governor in the Commonwealth since George Allen and Jim Gilmore did so in the 1993 and 1997 elections.",

      "A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick ruled Tuesday that any individual who needs to renew their passport because it expires within one year, apply for a new passport, or change their name or sex designation may choose the gender that they identify with. Applicants can also still select \"X\" on a passport application form. Kobick's ruling expanded an earlier decision in April that only applied to six of the original plaintiffs.",
      "The executive order, issued by President Trump on Inauguration Day, directed the State Department to no longer issue U.S. passports with anything other than a male or female designation. It reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for Americans to self-select their gender on their passport application, and included an \"X\" for those who do not identify as either male or female.",
      "If passports with the \"X\" marker expired and were renewed under the new policy, those people who had previously selected it would be forced to choose male or female.",
      "In February, a group of transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs backed by the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming the executive order was discriminatory against them.",
      "In April, Kobick ruled that the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the new passport policy \"related to an important governmental interest\" and found that the policy discriminated against transgender Americans.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group\u2014transgender Americans\u2014who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her April decision. The judge reaffirmed Tuesday that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

    "story": [
      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers last week in San Diego.",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Sayed Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego after he attended a mandatory immigration hearing on Wednesday, June 11.",
      "\"For more than three years I worked for the U.S. military back in my home country,\" Naser said in the video as the masked officers took him into custody. \"I came here to make a better life. I didn't know this was going to happen like this for me.\"",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "The Department for Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to, and DHS did not respond to our request for more information.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 18:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has ignored a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. A deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday the president would sign the latest executive order this week delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days, marking the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "The current extension expires Thursday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support that gave ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law was upheld by the Supreme Court days before it took effect.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "summary": "A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on whether President Trump must return control of California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in San Francisco weighed Tuesday whether President Trump can continue with his deployment of California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations and appeared skeptical of the state's arguments against the president's mobilization of more than 4,000 troops.",
      "The three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard arguments on a Justice Department request for it to halt a district judge's order that required Mr. Trump to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom while the court fight moves forward. Newsom, a Democrat, objects to the federalization of the National Guard in Los Angeles.",
      "Brett Shumate, an assistant attorney general with the Justice Department, said Mr. Trump's decision to call National Guard troops into federal service under a law known as Title 10 is unreviewable by courts, regardless of the facts of the case. If the panel were to side with California, he warned, \"it puts Article III judges on a collision course with the commander-in-chief.\"",
      "Shumate said that California's interpretation of the law is \"dangerous\" and would allow Newsom to issue a \"pocket veto\" of any future orders from Mr. Trump. He said it's \"essential\" that the district court's injunction be lifted and said leaving it intact would put \"lives and property at risk.\"",
      "Shumate said that if the 9th Circuit declines to halt the district judge's order, it should allow the Justice Department time to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "But Sam Harbourt, a deputy solicitor general for California, said Mr. Trump's order calling the National Guard into federal service sweeps too broadly. He told the court that the president failed to consider any \"modest measures\" to quell protests in Los Angeles before taking the \"grave and extraordinary step\" of calling forth the National Guard.",
      "Harbourt told the judges that Mr. Trump circumvented Newsom when he unilaterally decided to deploy the California National Guard to Los Angeles and warned that the continued presence of troops in city streets would escalate tensions and the risk of violence.",
      "The three judges considering the Trump administration's request for a stay during the appeal are Judges Mark Bennett, Eric Miller and Jennifer Sung. Mr. Trump appointed Bennett and Miller during his first term, and former President Joe Biden tapped Sung for the 9th Circuit.",
      "Early on, Bennett appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's position that courts cannot review the president's decision to federalize the National Guard and should not second-guess his military judgments. But as the arguments continued, all three judges pressed Harbourt on his position.",
      "Bennett asked where in the law there is a requirement for the president to have considered alternative measures before exercising control of the National Guard. He also probed Harbourt on his claim that Title 10 required Mr. Trump to consult with Newsom before calling the California troops into federal service.",
      "Miller cited a state law that he said effectively makes the adjutant general of the California National Guard a \"substitute\" for the governor. Mr. Trump had directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to effectuate the federalization of Guard troops, and he then issued memoranda to the adjutant general to transfer authority over the Guard from the state to the federal government.",
      "The case landed before the 9th Circuit after U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled last week that Mr. Trump's actions in deploying the National Guard to respond to protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles were illegal and blocked the administration from deploying the troops in the city.",
      "The Trump administration swiftly appealed that decision, and the 9th Circuit panel issued a temporary administrative stay while it took more time to consider the issue.",
      "The legal battle involves whether the president exceeded his authority when he invoked Title 10 to call forth the California National Guard in response to protests in California's largest city. Demonstrations broke out earlier this month after immigration agents conducted raids across Los Angeles as part of the administration's efforts to crack down on immigration and execute mass deportations.",
      "Title 10 lays out three circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service: when the U.S. is invaded or in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; when there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the U.S.; or when the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws. It then says that orders \"shall be issued through\" the governor.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his June 7 memorandum ordering the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members that the protests in Los Angeles \"constitute a form of rebellion,\" which allowed him to federalize the National Guard and bypass Newsom. An additional 2,000 troops were brought under federal command. Roughly 700 active-duty U.S. Marines have also been mobilized to the area to protect federal property and immigration agents during arrests.",
      "In his decision, Breyer rejected the president's claim that the demonstrations are a \"rebellion,\" writing that he is \"troubled by the implication inherent in defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion.\"",
      "The protests, the judge said, \"fall far short\" of rebellion, and the administration failed to identify a \"violent, armed, organized, open and avowed uprising against the government as a whole.\" The judge's order did not address the president's mobilization of the Marines to Los Angeles.",
      "In filings with the 9th Circuit, the Trump administration argued that courts do not have a role in reviewing the president's decision to deploy the troops. Even if courts could review his decision to call the National Guard into federal service, the Justice Department said the president had ample reason to determine that the protests in Los Angeles rose to the level of a \"danger\" of rebellion, one of the conditions laid out in Title 10.",
      "\"The district court's order improperly impinges on the commander in chief's supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the Held, and puts federal officers (and others) in harm's way,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote.",
      "Newsom and California officials told the 9th Circuit in filings that Breyer's order should be left undisturbed, as it restored the status quo in place before Mr. Trump's June 7 memorandum.",
      "\"Considered individually, defendants' legal arguments are meritless. Considered in the aggregate, they are terrifying,\" California lawyers wrote. They said that the administration's interpretation of Title 10 \"would empower the president to commandeer a state's National Guard based merely on evidence that some civilians opposed his authority, disobeyed his commands, or presented operational difficulties for civil law enforcement officials \u2014 and without any input from (or even notice to) the governor. \"",
      "They said that \"unchecked power\" could be used in any context, \"not just where civilians are protesting immigration enforcement, but also where they are protesting other policies of a federal administration, or protesting in advance of a hotly contested federal election.\"",
      "\"Collectively, defendants' arguments would sideline the judiciary, ignore Congress's limitations, and trample over the states' sovereign interest in their own militias,\" California's attorneys argued.",
      "Among the issues before the 9th Circuit panel is whether the Trump administration properly notified Newsom of its order calling the National Guard into federal service. The Justice Department argued in lower court proceedings that it did because two memos calling up the National Guard went through California's adjutant general, who runs the California National Guard, and not Newsom's office, as California has argued is necessary.",
      "That argument, Breyer wrote, \"strains credibility\" because Congress mandates that the National Guard requires the notice to be \"issued through the governors.\"",

At least 24 people in Israel have died in Iranian ballistic missile launches that have managed to make it through Israeli air defenses, Israel's military said.",

    "summary": "President Trump has instructed immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Sunday night directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after large protests erupted in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas against the Trump administration's immigration policies.",
      "In a Truth Social post, the president called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \"to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He added that to reach the goal officials \"must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"",
      "\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of the president's immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's\u00a0crackdown\u00a0on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News. The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the\u00a0agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he heard from hotel, agriculture and leisure industries that his \"very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them\" and promised that changes would be made.",
      "Opponents of the president's immigration policies took to the streets as part of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations Saturday that came as Mr. Trump held a massive parade in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The parade featured tanks, flyovers and fireworks.",
      "Mr. Trump made the call for stepped up enforcement in Democratic-controlled cities on social media as he was making his way to the Group of Seven economic summit in Alberta, Canada. The first thing on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Mr. Trump met Carney at the White House last month. The rest of the day will consist of meetings with the G7 leaders, and the traditional \"family photo\" of those leaders and a cultural event.",

      "The solar flare peaked at 5:49 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory said. It was an X-class flare \u2014 the most intense kind, NASA said. Solar flares are essentially \"giant explosions on the sun\" that send energy, light and high-speed particles into space, according to NASA.",
      "An image captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory shows the sun, colorized in teal to draw attention to the flare. The flare is visible as a bright flash at the center of the sun. The heat of a solar flare causes it to appear bright.",
      "The energy from solar flares can be disruptive, NASA says on its website. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals. They also can pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.",
      "Solar flares are also often associated with coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says online. Often, CMEs look like \"huge, twisted ropes,\" NASA says, because they involve the sun's magnetic fields. Coronal mass ejections can also disrupt radio and satellite communications, and can also cause geomagnetic storms on Earth.",
      "In May 2024, a powerful coronal mass ejection brought the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares were recorded. The storm caused some radio blackouts. Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

      "The agency did not provide any additional launch details, but based on the space station's orbit and rendezvous requirements, a Thursday takeoff would be targeted for 4:53 a.m. EDT.",
      "If that schedule holds up, commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu would aim for a docking at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 10:30 a.m. on Friday.",
      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",
      "The leak rates seen earlier could be related to \"a small amount of air flowing into the transfer tunnel across the hatch seal from the main part of the station,\" NASA said.",
      "\"By changing pressure in the transfer tunnel and monitoring over time, teams are evaluating the condition of the transfer tunnel configuration, resulting in an updated launch opportunity for the private astronaut mission.\"",

      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 20:12:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled that Tennessee's law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender youth does not violate the 14th Amendment.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a decision that is likely to have broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth in half of the country.",
      "In the case of U.S. v. Skrmetti, the high court ruled 6-3 to reject the challenge brought by the Biden administration, three families and a physician who had argued that Tennessee's law violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The court concluded that the state's measure, which is known as SB1 and was enacted in 2023, does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.",
      "The court's majority found that Tennessee's law is not subject to a heightened level of judicial review and satisfies the most deferential standard, known as rational basis.",
      "\"We are asked to decide whether SB1 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"We hold it is not. SB1 does not classify on the bases that warrant heightened review.\"",
      "The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent. Sotomayor read her opinion from the bench, saying \"in sadness, I dissent.\"",
      "The court, Sotomayor wrote, \"obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.\"",
      "Joined by Kagan and Jackson, she continued: \"The court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"",
      "The Tennessee law",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. The state is one of 25 with laws that seek to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first in which the Supreme Court stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth. In addition to the state prohibitions, President Trump has issued executive orders that address what he calls \"gender ideology.\" One declares that it is the federal government's policy to recognize \"two sexes, male and the female,\" and the second threatens federal funding for medical institutions that offer gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 18.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposals are being challenged in the federal courts.",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's law prevents health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Shortly before the law took effect, three families with transgender children and a physician who provides the treatments to patients with gender dysphoria challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened in the case.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status. A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued.",
      "The appeals court evaluated the law under rational-basis review, the most deferential of the tiers of judicial scrutiny. But the Biden administration and the families had argued Tennessee's ban should be subject to a more stringent level of review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it draws lines based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "But Tennessee had argued that the state aims to protect young people from the consequences of the medical treatments, which it said are risky and unproven. The state said it was setting age- and use-based limits on medical care and exercising its authority to regulate medicine.",
      "Access to gender-affirming care has become a flashpoint in the culture wars, as half of the states have in recent years enacted laws that limit the availability of the medical interventions. Many of those same states have also enacted measures prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.",
      "\"Today's landmark ruling by the Supreme Court is a victory for our Constitution, the rule of law, and common sense. Elected representatives have the right \u2014 and obligation \u2014 to protect children from falling victim to irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation,\" Liz Huston, White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \"President Trump will continue to speak out and take action to protect innocent American children from these barbaric procedures that are based on junk science.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision, which she said allows states to protect children.",
      "\"This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect America's children and parental rights. I encourage other states to follow Tennessee's lead and enact similar legislation to protect our kids,\" she said in a statement shared on social media.",
      "The court's decision",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority found that Tennessee's law classifies on the basis of age and medical use, since treatments like puberty blockers and hormones can be administered to treat certain conditions, but not gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder or gender incongruence.",
      "Classifications that turn on age or medical use are subject only to rational-basis review, the least demanding level of judicial review, it said.",
      "\"Under SB1, no minor may be administered puberty blockers or hormones to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence; minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other purposes,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The majority said that Tennessee had \"plausible reasons\" for restricting access to gender-affirming care that brought its inquiry over the law's constitutionality to an end, namely concerns about the health risks. The justices said they wouldn't second-guess the legislature over the lines that the ban draws.",
      "\"Recent developments only underscore the need for legislative flexibility in this area,\" Roberts wrote, pointing to a report from England's National Health Service that evaluated the evidence regarding the use of puberty blockers and hormones and characterized it as \"remarkably weak.\"",
      "\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" he wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.\"",
      "Roberts concluded that the court's role is only to ensure that the law does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas, Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito all issued separate concurring opinions to express their views on the case.",
      "Thomas said the dispute serves as a reminder that the American people and their elected officials can disagree with experts on questions of \"controversial medical questions,\" and courts should not sit as a \"super-legislature.\"",
      "\"The ongoing debate over the efficacy of sex-transition treatments for children confirms that medical and regulatory authorities are not of one mind about the treatments' risks and benefits,\" he wrote. \"These conditions illustrate why states may rightly be skeptical of groups or advocates claiming that expert consensus supports their position, and why courts must exercise restraint in reviewing state legislatures' decisions in this area.\"",
      "Barrett, meanwhile, wrote that the question of how to regulate a medical condition like gender dysphoria involves policy judgments that legislatures, not courts, are best positioned to make. She noted that transgender status implicates other areas that have been subject to regulation by states, including access to restrooms and transgender athletes' eligibility for sports teams. If those laws are subject to a more stringent level of scrutiny, courts will then be forced to scrutinize those legislative choices, she warned.",
      "\"But legislatures have many valid reasons to make policy in these areas, and so long as a statute is a rational means of pursuing a legitimate end, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied,\" she wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Thomas.",
      "The dissent",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that Tennessee's law discriminates against transgender adolescents and conditions the availability of medications on the patient's sex. In subjecting the law to rational-basis review, Sotomayor accused the majority of \"retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most\" and abandoning \"transgender children and their families to political whims.\"",
      "She said that the lower court should have evaluated the law under intermediate scrutiny because it draws lines on the basis of sex, and accused the majority of skirting its obligation to take a closer look at the ban.",
      "Sotomayor argued that there is a history of discrimination against transgender people in health care, employment and housing, and pointed to Mr. Trump's recent directives as evidence \u2014 namely his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect for now, and executive order seeking to ensure federal grant dollars do not promote what he calls \"gender ideology.\"",
      "She accused the majority of rendering \"transgender Americans doubly vulnerable to state-sanctioned discrimination,\" and said the high court could have ordered the 6th Circuit to apply the more stringent standard of review without wading into scientific and policy debates over the safety of medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Yet the majority inexplicably refuses to take even the modest step of requiring Tennessee to show its work before the lower courts,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, which represented the transgender adolescents and their families, lamented the Supreme Court's decision as a loss for transgender youth.",
      "\"Today's ruling is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution,\" said Chase Strangio, a co-director of the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project who participated in arguments before the Supreme Court. \"Though this is a painful setback, it does not mean that transgender people and our allies are left with no options to defend our freedom, our health care, or our lives.\"",

    "summary": "The facility will breed millions of sterile New World screwworm flies at Moore Air Base, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government on Wednesday released a five-prong policy initiative to stop the spread of New World screwworms\u00a0in live cattle and other animal imports, including its plan to build an $8.5 million insect dispersal facility in Texas.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said her department plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year. The facility will breed millions of sterile New World screwworm (NWS) flies at Moore Air Base, according to the initiative. The male flies will then be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larvae.",
      "It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.",
      "\"The United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,\" Rollins said during a news conference at the South Texas air base with other state and cattle industry officials.",
      "Late last year, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department warned outdoor enthusiasts to watch out for animals that may be impacted by the dangerous \"man-eater\" parasites from flies that lay eggs in open wounds, nostrils, eyes and mouths. Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico.",
      "The New World Screwworm has been making its way further north through the Americas, Texas officials said, and the fly's appearance in southern Mexico has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians' groups.",
      "According to the USDA, the New World Screwworm \"is a devastating pest.\" The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "The USDA also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said Wednesday in a post on X that Rollins' plan \"seems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-U.S. work.\"",
      "\"We trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million, as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer.\u00a0Pressure from the U.S.\u00a0prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larvae can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\"The only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\" Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat seriously and are pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration, as well, and see that having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile ones is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\"We have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\" Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \"There's an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\""

      "\"It happened so quickly\"",
      "\"We almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\" Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said during a news conference Sunday. \"During this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges and highways, where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents.

      "Vargo added: \"It happened so quickly and so fast. ... I've been doing this for 35 years. I've seen major floods here in the city and the county. I've never seen anything like this.\"",
      "Jim Blazier, the fire chief in Wheeling in the state's northern panhandle, said crews performed rescue operations into Sunday's early morning hours. He said first responders regrouped Sunday morning and were focused on an area from the Ohio state line across the Ohio River to Wheeling Creek.",
      "\"We're searching the banks, we're searching submerged vehicles, any debris we find along the trail and so forth,\" Blazier said. \"We're using drones, search dogs and swift water personnel, and we have teams organized that are searching sectors that we're trying to recover anybody that's missing.\"",
      "There were about 2,500 power outages in the county as of Sunday afternoon, the governor said. Restoration efforts were hampered by natural gas leaks that need to be fixed first, officials said.",

      "Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed in their home in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, at about 3:30 a.m. Saturday in what Gov. Tim Walz called a \"political assassination.\"",
      "Brooklyn Park police say the home had been boarded up early Sunday after investigators processed all of the evidence at the scene, and family members had removed \"items of value\" from the residence on Tuesday.",
      "\"It was discovered that the plywood covering the rear window of the home had been pried off and the window broken to gain entry,\" police said in a statement released late Wednesday morning.",
      "Police say crime scene investigators searched the home again, and family members say \"they don't believe anything was missing.\" Police are still searching for the suspect.",
      "Anyone with information on the break-in, including neighborhood residents who have surveillance cameras, are asked to contact the Brooklyn Park Police Department at 763-493-8222.",
      "Melissa Hortman's neighbors express disbelief, sarrow",
      "Geoff Olinyk, a longtime neighbor of the Hortmans, says he's outraged by the break-in.",
      "\"Whoever it was that broke in has no respect for the deceased couple that lived here,\" Olinyk said. \"It's a horrible deal that people would come now and desecrate their memory by breaking into the house.\"",
      "Christine Cole-Finch says she and her dog Libby would join Melissa Hortman and her dog, Gilbert, on neighborhood walks. Gilbert was also shot in the attack and had to be put down by the Hortmans' children.",
      "\"It's horrible. I think it's really horrible. It's hard to put words to it,\" Cole-Finch said. \"Even days later we're still struggling with it.\"",
      "Some say the break-in feels as if the Hortmans are being attacked again.",
      "\"It's just very disturbing to know that someone would want to break into a house after a tragedy like this,\" said neighbor Sarah Abuisnaineh.",
      "As the investigations continue, neighbors have already started to tend the Hortmans' gardens, as well as the growing memorial in their front yard.",
      "\"Melissa was really taking care of her gardens whenever she wasn't doing her legislative work,\" Olinyk said.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Melissa Hortman's mother, Linda Haluptzok, said the pain of her daughter's death is \"mind-numbing.\" Her brother, Patrick Haluptzok, says his family is \"just trying to get by.\"",
      "\"It's been very hard the last few days, in what seems unfair and tragic, the way her last night was spent,\" said Patrick Haluptzok.",
      "A candlelight vigil for the Hortmans is scheduled for Wednesday at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul from 8 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., which Gov. Tim Walz plans to attend. People are asked to bring their own candles, but do not bring signs.",
      "\"This senseless violence came to my door as well\"",
      "The man accused in the killings,\u00a057-year-old Vance Boelter, is in custody and facing federal and state murder charges following a 36-plus-hour manhunt that authorities say was the largest of its kind in state history.",

Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, announced on Monday she was targeted while at home, but Boelter was reportedly scared off by a police officer before approaching the residence.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 18:44:07 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will maintain the benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, marking a continuation of its \"wait-and-see\" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies.",
      "The central bank also expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, but it still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as it projected in March.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference to discuss the rate decision.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The rate has remained at that level since President Trump took office in January. The last time the Fed cut rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "When determining rate cuts, the Fed's goal is to keep inflation low and maintain a healthy job market. In its announcement\u00a0Wednesday, the central bank mentioned solid labor market conditions and an economy that continues to grow at a \"solid pace\" although it also signaled caution.",
      "\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated,\" the Fed wrote in its announcement.",
      "At the Wednesday press conference, Powell underscored the relative strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions including the 4.2% unemployment rate, a low inflation rate and improvements in business and consumer sentiment. But he added that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth in the economy this year.",
      "In its latest\u00a0quarterly projections\u00a0for the economy and interest rates, the Fed said it expects that inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will pick up to 3% by year end. The central bank also expects unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%, up from the current 4.2%.",
      "\"The thing that every outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4% in May, still above the Fed's target rate of 2%. There has been speculation that Mr. Trump's tariffs could drive up inflation, but so far it has largely remained in check.",
      "Powell said that he expect the Fed will learn a \"great deal more\" on tariffs over the summer and that the developments will inform their thinking moving forward. In the meantime, the Fed Chair said the central bank is well positioned to hold off on rate cuts. \"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" he said.",
      "More tariff changes are expected in the coming months. President Trump's 90-day-pause on reciprocal tariffs ends July 9.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "Fed officials said they predict two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, in keeping with what they projected in March, but did not specify when future cuts might happen.",
      "\"What we're waiting for to reduce rates is to understand what will happen with the tariff inflation,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Others, meanwhile, are betting a rate reduction will come in September. Economists give a roughly 60% probability that the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate at its September 17 meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "But analysts also remain cautious in their predictions. \"If the June and July inflation measures remain tepid \u2014 and especially if the labor market starts to show signs of weakness \u2014 that could have investors wondering if the Fed may consider a cut at its July 29-30 meeting,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What does this mean for your money?",
      "The federal funds rate reflects the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans. A higher benchmark rate can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers because it helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "When the benchmark rate is lowered, loan rates tend to follow, making it less expensive to borrow money.",
      "With the Fed keeping rates steady, it's unlikely that borrowers will see near-term relief on their lending costs.",
      "\"This is music to the ears of savers, like retirees, that are earning good income on their hard-earned savings,\" said Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email. \"But it underscores the urgency for borrowers to aggressively pay down high-cost credit card debt and offers little hope of a significant drop in interest rates any time soon.\"",
      "What has President Trump said about interest rates?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on the Fed to slash rates, including on Wednesday morning before the Fed announced its decision. During remarks to the press, Mr. Trump called out Powell, saying he's \"done a poor job.\"",
      "\"We had the highest inflation we ever had and then it came down when I got elected,\" he said. \"Now we have a man who refuses to lower the Fed rate.\"",

      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a 19% cut to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM. It uses the Android operating system.",
      "It's unclear what company will manufacture the devices, with the Trump Mobile website noting that its products and services \"are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\" The website adds that the T1 Phone LLC is using the \"Trump\" name as part of a limited license agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

      "Vance Boelter, 57, is in the Sherburne County Jail on Tuesday in Elk River, Minnesota, facing several federal and state charges for the shootings that killed a state representative and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife.",
      "Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot inside their Brooklyn Park home overnight Saturday. About 90 minutes before that, police say Boelter shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans were struck multiple times and are still recovering.",
      "About six years ago, Boelter was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. But what exactly does being appointed to that board mean?",
      "What we know about Boelter's appointment on workforce board",
      "State records show Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the development board, first appointed by\u00a0then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016. Three years later, Walz reappointed him.",
      "A spokesperson for Walz's office gave this statement to WCCO on Tuesday:",
      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",
      "According to the development board's website, it \"represents key leaders from business, education, labor, community-based organizations, and government,\" with the board providing \"a venue for workforce stakeholders building on a shared vision and mission.\"",
      "Boelter's expertise was rooted in his work as a general manager at a Speedway gas station.",
      "During Boelter's second term, which ended in January 2023, he served alongside Sen. John Hoffman. It's unclear at this point if the two worked closely.",
      "David Schultz, political science professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, says under state law, the governor appoints hundreds of people to dozens of boards across the state, ranging in topics as disparate as amateur sports, mosquito control and tourism.",
      "Schultz says appointees are unpaid and the state's boards are more technical than political, with bipartisan appointments and, essentially, citizen volunteers. The governor's role, according to Schultz, is more ceremonial.",
      "\"They're not vetted or reviewed personally by the governor. In many cases, this is done as it should be, by subordinates, you know, who then bring to the governor the recommendations,\" Schultz said. \"And this is no different than what we would find in business and industry, where we don't expect the president of most companies to be involved in the hiring for every position.\"",
      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",
      "U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, who was previously lieutenant governor under Dayton and also served as his chief of staff, echoed Schultz that governors don't directly choose board appointments.",
      "\"Those workforce training councils or groups are very much not political, and the governor would often appoint people to those committees that they did not know personally, but were recommended by industry groups,\" she said in an interview with WCCO.",

      "Boelter also visited the homes of two other lawmakers early Saturday. Sen.

      "U.S. residents accounted for more than half of all new millionaires created across the globe in 2024. The surge in American millionaires was bolstered by robust stock market returns, with the S&P 500 jumping more than 23% last year.",
      "\"Wealth growth was tilted strongly towards North America, driven by a stable U.S. dollar and upbeat financial markets,\" UBS analysts wrote in the report.",
      "Globally, a total of 680,000 people became new millionaires in 2024, a 1.2% uptick compared to the year prior.",
      "UBS expects that number to keep growing over the next five years. By 2029, the bank projects an additional 5.34 million people will see their net worths reach at least $1 million.",
      "Despite the growing share of millionaires, most Americans' wealth falls well short of seven figures. At the end of 2024, in the Americas, the average wealth per adult was around $312,000, according to the report.",

      "Combining the new millionaires with the ranks of those already in the seven-figure club, the Americas accounted for nearly 40% \u2014 or about 24 million \u2014 of the world's millionaires in 2024, followed by Asia-Pacific (36%), and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (25%).",

    "summary": "An actor who worked on Tyler Perry's TV series \"The Oval\" has filed a lawsuit accusing Perry of sexual assault and harassment during his time on the show.",
    "story": [
      "Tyler Perry has been accused in a civil lawsuit of repeatedly sexually assaulting and harassing an actor on \"The Oval,\" a TV drama that Perry created, according to a new lawsuit. The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",
      "Matthew Boyd, an attorney representing Perry, denied the allegations in a statement obtained by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,\" the statement said. \"But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\"",
      "Dixon appeared on 85 episodes of \"The Oval,\" which has had a six-season run on the network BET. The actor's most recent appearances came during the latest season of the series earlier this year, according to IMDB. His lawsuit seeks at least $260 million in damages.",
      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It alleges the behavior happened during Dixon's time as a series regular on \"The Oval,\" when Perry \"held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities.\"",
      "The lawsuit, first reported Tuesday by TMZ, says that Perry first noticed Dixon in 2019 when Dixon was part of the event staff at a Perry party, and later offered an audition.",
      "Dixon would first appear in a small role on the Perry series \"Ruthless\" before getting the bigger role on the political drama \"The Oval.\"",
      "Perry soon began sending unwanted sexual text messages to Dixon, according to the lawsuit, which includes alleged screenshots of several of them.",
      "\"What's it going to take for you to have guiltless sex?\" one of the messages says.",
      "The lawsuit claims Perry offered Dixon an increasingly prominent role on the show as his sexual advances became more aggressive.",
      "In the lawsuit, the actor says he tried to remain friendly while maintaining boundaries.",
      "\"Dixon did his best to tiptoe around Mr. Perry's sexual aggression while keeping on Mr. Perry's good side,\" the lawsuit says. \"Mr. Perry made it clear to Dixon that if Dixon ignored Perry or failed to engage with the sexual innuendoes, Dixon's character would 'die.'\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges Perry eventually sexually assaulted Dixon on \"multiple occasions,\" including an instance where he \"forcibly pulled off Mr. Dixon's clothing, groped his buttocks, and attempted to force himself on Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon clearly told Perry \"No,\" but was initially ignored until he was able to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The following day, the suit claims, Perry apologized, and told Dixon he would work with Dixon on a TV pilot Dixon was seeking to produce.",
      "Dixon says he later received a raise that the lawsuit suggests was part of an attempt to keep him quiet.",
      "He said the fear of his character dying kept him quiet as intended.",
      "Perry also produced and bought the rights to the pilot, called \"Losing It,\" but the lawsuit alleges Perry had no intention of selling the show and was using it only for leverage over Dixon.",
      "The lawsuit describes several other alleged assaults. In one of those alleged instances, the suit claims Perry climbed into bed with Dixon, uninvited, and groped him while Dixon was staying in a guest room at Perry's house.",
      "It also alleges that Dixon eventually moved from Atlanta, home to Perry's production studio, to Los Angeles to put distance between the two of them, but \"Mr. Perry continued to sexually harass Mr. Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon in 2024 filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dixon quit the show when its producer's did not take action to investigate his accusations, even after he had filed that complaint with the EEOC.",
      "CBS News and The Associated Press do not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Dixon has.",
      "\"The Oval\" is one of many television series executive produced by, written by and directed by the 55-year-old Perry, who first became known as creator and star of the \"Madea\" films and has since built a major production empire in TV and movies.

    "summary": "Sen. Ted Cruz sparred with media personality Tucker Carlson, highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies over whether to join Israel's campaign against Iran.",
    "story": [
      "An interview between Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz about Israel's military campaign against Iran became contentious when the ex-Fox News host quizzed the Texas Republican about Iran \u2014 highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies.",
      "The back-and-forth hinged on Cruz's backing of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration has stated the U.S. is not directly involved in the offensive, but it has helped Israel defend against Iranian counterattacks, and Mr. Trump has weighed conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Carlson \u2014 a vocal skeptic of military intervention \u2014 questioned the premise of joining a war with Iran and criticized Cruz for saying he would like the Iranian regime to be toppled, saying to Cruz at one point: \"You don't know anything about Iran.\"",
      "One of the most contentious exchanges in the two-hour interview \u2014 which was released in full on X Wednesday \u2014 came when Carlson asked Cruz what Iran's population is. Cruz said he wasn't sure.",
      "\"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\" Carlson asked.",
      "\"I don't sit around memorizing population tables,\" Cruz retorted.",
      "The host then followed up by asking Cruz about Iran's demographics. When Cruz said they were Persians, predominantly Shia Muslims, Carlson asked him for the percentage, frustrating the Texas senator.",
      "\"Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,\" Cruz said.",
      "The two Trump supporters also argued about whether Iran has sought to assassinate Mr. Trump, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged last week. Federal prosecutors last year\u00a0announced charges against an Iranian asset, accusing him of plotting to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz cited the alleged assassination plots while criticizing Iran's leadership, but Carlson questioned why the senator hadn't instead supported immediate U.S. military action if he believed Iran has tried to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz, meanwhile, suggested Carlson at one point has a \"weird \u2026 obsession with Israel\" when Carlson asked about support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Carlson said he interpreted the comment as an accusation of antisemitism, which Cruz denied.",
      "\"You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to overthrow, and you're calling me reckless,\" Carlson said late in the interview.",
      "\"I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons that could kill millions of Americans. You say 'I can't see how that benefits America in any way.' That is bizarre,\" Cruz responded.",
      "The sparring continued on social media, with Cruz accusing Carlson of \"playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran\" and mocking the question about Iran's size.",
      "The bitter exchange reflects a wider divide among Mr. Trump's backers on how involved the U.S. should get in the Israel-Iran conflict. The president has long criticized foreign intervention, but has also supported pressuring Iran.",
      "Mr. Trump's closest advisers have not reached agreement on whether the president should strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CBS News has reported.",
      "Some Republicans, in addition to Cruz, have backed a hardline policy against Iran and are open to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iran. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0told CBS News over the weekend he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but if that fails, he urged Mr. Trump \"to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program.\"",
      "During the interview, Cruz told Carlson he doesn't support sending U.S. troops into Iran, but told reporters Wednesday the president \"could quite reasonably make the decision\" to bomb Iran's subterranean nuclear site at\u00a0Fordo.",
      "But other Trump allies are wary of intervention. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Carlson in an interview he views stopping \"forever wars\" as a core MAGA tenet, and suggested U.S. involvement in Iran could \"blow up the coalition\" and harm Mr. Trump's domestic priorities. Still, Bannon told reporters Wednesday he thinks \"the vast majority of the MAGA movement\" would trust Mr. Trump's judgment if he decides striking Iran is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of congressional Republicans have called for a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from taking military action on Iran without congressional approval.",
      "It's unclear how the president will proceed, though he downplayed the idea of an intra-MAGA rift over Iran on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"my supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them.\"",
      "The president also repeatedly lashed out at Carlson on Monday, before the Cruz interview was released. The president called him \"kooky\" in a Truth Social post, and seemed to mock Carlson over his ouster from Fox News.",
      "\"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",

      "Why is Iran's Fordo nuclear site such a concern?",
      "Two experts told CBS News in 2012 \u2014 the last time Netanyahu looked close to attacking Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 that Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses, was the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons \"breakout\" program.",
      "Fordo is \"obviously for nuclear weapons hedging, to preserve centrifuges in case of an attack\" on other, more vulnerable facilities, Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on Iran's nuclear program at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "Israel attacked the only other nuclear facility known to house significant uranium enrichment facilities in Iran last week, causing damage at Natanz.",
      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first term, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz, which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

    "summary": "The location of the HMS Endeavour, a lost ship belonging to 18th-century British explorer Captain James Cook, has been confirmed as Rhode Island's Newport Harbor.",
    "story": [
      "Researchers have confirmed that the 18th-century British explorer Captain James Cook's lost ship found its final resting place in Rhode Island's Newport Harbor, solving a decadeslong mystery, according to the Australian National Maritime Museum.",
      "Two Australian historians, Mike Connell and Des Liddy, originally pinpointed the location of the ship, called HMS Endeavour\u00a0in 1998, the museum said in a report released earlier this month. The museum's report detailed how a 26-year archival and archaeological research program ultimately determined that the Endeavour was, in fact, at the bottom of Newport Harbor as Connell and Liddy had thought.",
      "Captain Cook famously sailed the Endeavour across the Pacific Ocean multiple times in the mid-1700s. He is remembered for his voyage to Tahiti, New Zealand and Australia, which he claimed for Britain, as well as Hawaii, where he ultimately met his fate in a dispute with indigenous residents. Cook's exploration of the islands laid the foundation for British colonization in those areas, which is why, for different reasons, it's an important part of Australian history, according to the museum's report.",
      "\"For some, the Pacific voyage led by James Cook between 1768 and 1771 embodies the spirit of Europe's Age of Enlightenment,\" the executive summary of the report reads, \"while for others it symbolises the onset of colonisation and the subjugation of First Nations Peoples.\"",
      "After Cook's death, the Endeavour returned to England, which went on to use it for transporting British troops and detaining prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. It was sold to private owners, who renamed the ship Lord Sandwich, and deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in the midst of war in 1778.",
      "When Australian maritime experts\u00a0initially announced in 2022 that they believed the Endeavour was among a number of ancient shipwrecks still scattered across Newport Harbor, the claim was widely debated. But a partnership between the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission and the Australian National Maritime Museum forged ahead with the research that eventually led to the wreck's identification. They are working to ensure that the wreck site is protected from now on.",
      "\"Given Endeavour's historical and cultural significance to Australia, Aotearoa New Zealand, England, the United States of America and First Nations peoples throughout the Pacific Ocean, positive identification of its shipwreck site requires securing the highest possible level of legislative and physical protection,\" the report says.",

    "summary": "Israel's prime minister has declined to rule out assassinating Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. President Trump says he'd be an \"easy target,\" and \"our patience is wearing thin.\"",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's 86-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the figurehead of what he calls an \"existential\" threat to Israel. Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel would like to see, and even help to precipitate, a change of regime in Iran, which has been ruled by a hardline theocratic government since the 1979 Islamic revolution.",
      "On Friday, after ordering the first attacks on\u00a0Iran's nuclear sites, Netanyahu said: \"Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people. Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.\"",
      "He urged the people of Iran \"to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,\" adding, \"This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.\"",
      "Asked by ABC News in an interview that aired Monday if Israel would try to kill Khamenei, Netanyahu would only say that his country was \"doing what we need to do.\"",
      "He rejected suggestions that such a move would be escalatory, however, saying, \"It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.\"",
      "In a post on his own Truth Social media platform Tuesday, President Trump said: \"We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "Israel's strikes hit Khamenei's inner circle",
      "\"I imagine the supreme leader is currently unable to sleep and worried about whether he'll be alive or not,\" Holly Dagres, a regional expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have killed several of Iran's top generals and security advisers to the ayatollah, dealing a blow to his inner circle, which, according to the Reuters news agency, consists of only 15 to 20 trusted loyalists. The dead include the commander-in-chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran's ballistic missile program Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and spy chief Mohammad Kazemi.",
      "On Tuesday, Israel's military boasted about killing the man tapped to replace the Iranian military's chief of staff, just four days after it killed his predecessor in its first round of strikes.",
      "\"We eliminated Ali Shadmani, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime,\" Israeli military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Tuesday. \"He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation. He only managed to fill the position for 4 days.\"",
      "But even if Israel were to kill the ayatollah himself, Dagres said Iran's clerical regime has an established process in place to keep the government stable.",
      "Iran is not run by \"one man and some generals\"",
      "\"The thing with the Islamic Republic is this isn't just one man and some generals,\" Dagres told CBS News. \"This is a system or an apparatus that has been thought through very extensively. The Islamic Republic has something that's akin to the (Vatican's) College of Cardinals \u2014 the Assembly of Experts, and they actually determine who gets to be supreme leader.\"",
      "The top-level religious body, also known as Iran's Council of Experts, is composed of 88 senior Islamic clerics who are responsible for electing Iran's supreme leader, usually when the current one dies.",
      "\"From what we've been seeing so far, it doesn't sound like any of those people have been targeted\" by Israel, said Dagres. \"This is a replaceable regime in terms of leadership at the top, because they're prepared for the eventual death of a supreme leader.\"",
      "Even if Iran's entire theocratic system of government were to collapse, the upheaval would not necessarily guarantee a new government that is any friendlier to Iran's own repressed people, to Israel, or to the United States.",
      "\"There could be a scenario where the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps takes over, and they could go in different directions,\" said Dagres. \"They could be more authoritarian. They can be more Western-friendly. We don't know. I think one of the lessons of the Arab Spring, up until the fall of Assad, was that what happens isn't always better.\"",
      "Those Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings across the Middle East in 2010 \u2014 in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Tunisia \u2014 were initially met with hope in the democratic Western world, but in most of those countries, the bids for democracy either devolved into civil war, or were beaten back by new or returning authoritarian regimes or the rise of extremist groups.",
      "Could internal tension threaten Iran's regime?",
      "Echoing Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday he could suffer a fate similar to Iraq's former President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi strongman's regime fell in 2003 after nearly a quarter century. He was found hiding in a bunker by U.S. forces and was then sentenced to death by a special Iraqi tribunal and hanged for crimes against humanity.",
      "\"I warn the Iranian dictator against continuing to commit war crimes and launch missiles toward Israeli civilians,\" Katz said on Tuesday. \"He should remember what happened to the dictator in the neighboring country to Iran who took the same path against Israel.\"",
      "Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and commentator in Tel Aviv, told CBS News on Tuesday that the \"kinds of tensions that cause a regime to fall are usually internal, not external.\"",
      "\"A country of 10 million cannot precipitate a regime change in a country of 90 million,\" Pinkas noted, highlighting the vast discrepancy in size between Israel and the much larger Iran, which he noted was also 1,100 miles away.",
      "\"For that to happen, for a regime change to happen, you need basically a reenactment of the failed Iraq invasion [by the U.S.] of 2003,\" Pinkas said. \"And I don't think anyone wants that, certainly not the Americans.\"",
      "He views Netanyahu's call for Iranians to rise up against their own leadership as \"sheer arrogance.\"",
      "\"I doubt anyone living in Tehran and listening to Netanyahu would say, 'Oh, wow, you know, this is a call for action, I should get out and fight the regime because Mr. Netanyahu, a thousand miles away, told me to do so.'\"",
      "The last time mass anti-government street protests erupted in Iran was in 2022 with the so-called \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement. That outrage was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's religious police, reportedly after being detained for an improper head covering.",
      "Netanyahu has repeated the three-word protest refrain in messages aimed directly at Iranians since his country launched its attacks late last week.",
      "But those protests in Iran were quashed quickly \u2014 and aggressively \u2014 by Iranian authorities and had died down by the spring of 2023.",
      "Since Israel started bombing Iran last week, no one has taken to the streets in Iranian cities. The country's residents appear to be focusing on the immediate threat, scrambling for shelter and to evacuate major cities as Israeli bombs fall.",
      "\"Why would you be on the streets if Israeli jets are bombarding those very streets or bombarding military targets not far from you,\" noted Pinkas. \"They're driving away, as far away as possible from Tehran \u2026 but I think that when the dust settles \u2014 and that could be in two, three days, it could also be in three weeks, I honestly cannot predict that \u2014 I think a lot of that anger will be taken out on the regime.\"",
      "In other words, even if Israel's actions don't prompt an immediate toppling of Iran's Islamic rulers, it could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their clerical leaders. If that happens, it could come at one of the ayatollah's weakest moments in almost half a century.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's not just \"looking for a ceasefire\" in the Israel-Iran war. He also warned all of Tehran's residents to evacuate.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said early Tuesday morning that he wants \"a real end\" to Iran's nuclear problem, with Tehran \"giving up entirely\" its enrichment activities. He said he was not just working toward a ceasefire to end the war between Iran and Israel, which has claimed at least two dozen lives in Israel and hundreds in Iran as it enters its fifth day.",
      "\"I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after\u00a0cutting short his time at the G7 summit in Canada. \"We're looking for better than a ceasefire,\" he added.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"",
      "He did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Israel's military said it had taken full control of the airspace over Tehran.",
      "\"Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured 'stuff,'\" Mr. Trump said in his post Tuesday. \"Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump's post, administration officials had stressed that the U.S. was \"not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran.\"",
      "The president also\u00a0said earlier\u00a0that French President Emmanuel Macron had \"mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a 'cease fire' between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",
      "The president said it was possible he could send special envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, or both, to meet with Iranian negotiators, but \"it depends what happens when I get back\" to Washington.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",
      "Asked if it would take U.S. involvement to destroy Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Trump said he hoped it would be \"wiped out long before that.\"",
      "Vance says Trump has \"shown remarkable restraint\" but \"may decide he needs to take further action\"",
      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",

      "A popular Mexican band under investigation for glorifying a wanted drug lord has released an anti-narco song in a bid to clear its name.",
      "The band, Los Alegres del Barranco, is accused of condoning crime over a song praising Nemesio Oseguera, head of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel in western Mexico.",
      "In April, the United States, which has designated the cartel as a terrorist organization, revoked the band's visas for displaying images of Oseguera during a concert and last month prosecutors in Jalisco state opened an investigation into the group. Oseguera \u2014 better known as \"El Mencho\" \u2014 has a $15 million U.S. bounty on his head.",
      "In a bid to curry favor with the authorities, the band released a new song on YouTube on Sunday titled \"El Consejo\" (The Advice). Its lyrics warn that there are only two avenues open to those who become involved in drug trafficking: \"the pantheon (of dead traffickers) or prison.\"",
      "The Jalisco prosecutor's office reacted positively to the new track, which had garnered nearly 80,000 views on Monday, saying that \"by spreading a positive message in a song, there is a possibility that the investigation will be suspended.\"",

    "summary": "Residents in Barcelona, Spain, and several other popular European destinations say tourism in their cities is driving up housing costs for locals.",
    "story": [
      "Residents in Spain and several other popular destinations in Europe protested against mass tourism Sunday, saying a flood of summer visitors is driving up housing costs in their cities and pushing out locals.",
      "Some of the protesters in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns.",
      "The protests were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\"The squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\" Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \"Barcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\"",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \"bubble tea\" spots.",
      "\"Our lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\"",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \"Everywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\" The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination's historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \"One more tourist, one less resident.\" They stuck stickers saying \"Citizen Self-Defense,\" in Catalan, and \"Tourist Go Home,\" in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel's doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona's main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but Wanda said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit weather.",
      "\"That's lovely, thank you sweetheart,\" she said to the squirter. \"I am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\"",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed a record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain's capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \"Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain's Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \"cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\" which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \"Your Airbnb was my home.\"",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\"I think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\" Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago, recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\"In the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\" he said.",
      "In another strategy, last year, Barcelona's leaders launched a program to replace outdated infrastructure in public schools to address rising temperatures, paid for by a tax on tourists.",
      "\"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News at the time.",
      "But some residents say the program misses the point.",
      "\"The government should be doing this without depending on tourism \u2026 it's public health,\" activist Agnes Rodriguez said. \"If you're coming to Barcelona tonight, to Chicago or to New York, and you're staying in a tourist apartment where a family should be living, you are part of this city changing. You're affecting the life of people living there.\"",

      "Hearing loss is one of the most common conditions affecting older adults, with about one in three Americans between 65 and 74 affected, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).",
      "While some of this loss is due to the hair cells in the inner ears breaking down with age and not picking up vibrations as well, per WebMD, there are some risk factors that can be controlled with behavior modifications.",
      "Making small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise.",
      "COMMON AGING SYMPTOM COULD WORSEN LONELINESS IN SENIORS",
      "Below are some practical tips you can start implementing today.",
      "1. \u00a0Limit exposure to loud noises",
      "Whether it's a crowded concert, heavy traffic or the constant hum of power tools, repeated exposure to high noise levels is known to cause permanent damage to the delicate structures in the inner ear.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to these loud environments, the NIH states.",
      "Making small changes now can help protect your ears and hearing later in life, experts advise. (iStock)",

      "Damage to the inner ear can happen long before it shows up on a hearing test, according to the NIH, which means prevention is key.",
      "When loud situations are unavoidable, and you expect to be exposed for more than a few minutes, experts recommend wearing ear protection, such as foam earplugs or noise-canceling earmuffs.",
      "One of the most effective ways to protect your hearing as you age is to limit your exposure to loud environments.",

      "Although hearing loss is common with age, it\u2019s not the only auditory issue.",
      "According to the AARP (American Association of Retired Persons), conditions like tinnitus, which often peaks between ages 60 and 69, can also develop. Tinnitus causes persistent sounds such as ringing, hissing, buzzing or whooshing in the ears.",

      "Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports on a new barrage of Iranian missiles launched toward Israel as air raid sirens sound across the country.",
      "As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, voters are torn on Israel\u2019s decision to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, yet they agree Iran is a national security threat and that what happens abroad matters to life in the U.S.",
      "Seventy-three percent of registered voters think Iran poses a real threat to the U.S., a 13-point increase from six years ago (the last time this question was asked).",
      "\"The increased sense that Iran constitutes a threat is real, but it also reflects the unique timing and circumstances surrounding this poll,\" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. \"The poll was in the field as images of Iranian missiles falling on Tel Aviv dominated television and the internet -- the immediacy and clarity of the conflict undoubtedly contributes to how voters gauge what is at risk.\"",
      "Majorities of Democrats (69%), Republicans (82%), and Independents (62%) agree Iran poses a real risk and those numbers are up since 2019 (by 12, 17, and 4 points respectively).",
      "The latest Fox survey, released Wednesday as President Donald Trump urged for Iran\u2019s \"unconditional surrender,\" also finds voters split on Israel\u2019s decision to launch military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear programs \u2013 nearly half (49%) approve of the strikes while slightly fewer (46%) disapprove.",
      "Republicans (73% approve) are more than twice as likely as Democrats (32%) and Independents (32%) to approve of the strikes.",
      "FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM",
      "Voters have contradictory concerns. On the one hand, voters are pessimistic about how the air strikes will affect security. Most think the attacks against Iran will make the world a more dangerous place (59%) rather than safer (36%).\u00a0About three-quarters of Democrats (74%) and Independents (77%) agree the strikes will increase peril, as do nearly 4 in 10 Republicans (36%).",
      "On the other hand, voters are worried about Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Almost 8 in 10 say they are also extremely or very concerned about Iran\u2019s nuclear program (78%) up from 66% in April and matching the high in September 2010. The increase comes from demographics across the board.",
      "FOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRATS' FAVORABILITY HITS NEW LOW, STILL FAVORED OVER GOP IN 2026 MIDTERMS",
      "While concern is palpable, voters see other issues as more pressing. When presented with a list of eight issues, Iran\u2019s nuclear program falls in the middle.\u00a0The future of the U.S. (85% extremely or very concerned), inflation (84%), and government spending (80%) rank higher while antisemitism (69%), illegal immigration (67%), the use of U.S. military troops domestically (66%), and protests in U.S. cities (63%) rank lower than concerns about Iran.",
      "While roughly 8 in 10 Democrats, Republicans, and Independents are concerned about Iran getting a nuke, it only ranks in the top three concerns for Republicans.",
      "Overall, 8 in 10 think what happens in the Middle East matters a great deal or some to life in the U.S. (81%) while more than half support financial aid to the Israelis for their military (53%), a 3-point increase since March, but down from a high of 60% in November 2023, shortly after the October 7 Hamas attacks.",
      "Since November 2023, Democrats (-14 points) and Independents (-11) are less likely to support sending money to the Israelis while Republicans (+4 points) solidified their support.",
      "\"Even though most think the stakes are high, there is a reticence to get involved in the Middle East,\" says Shaw. \"The public isn\u2019t blind to history and history teaches us that those who get directly involved in these conflicts do so at their peril.\"",
      "Trump left the G7 summit early on Monday along with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing the ongoing and intensifying situation in the Middle East as the reason.",
      "Trump\u2019s approval rating on foreign policy has held relatively steady since April: 42% approve vs. 57% disapprove for a net negative rating of -15, it was -14 last month.\u00a0He fares better on border security (53% approve, 46% disapprove) and immigration (46%, 53%) while he does worse on the economy (40%, 58%) and inflation (34%, 64%).",
      "Overall, 46% approve of his job performance as president, while 54% disapprove.",
      "Trump\u2019s personal favorable rating held steady at 45%, compared to those in his administration.",
      "Trump\u2019s personal favorable rating held steady at 45%. Compared to those in his administration, Trump\u2019s about even with Vice President JD Vance (44% favorable) and performs better than Rubio (42%), Elon Musk (41%), and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (32%). Robert F. Kennedy Jr. does the best with a 48% favorable rating.",
      "For comparison, the favorable ratings among Democratic Party leaders were in the same ballpark: Kamala Harris (49% favorable), Joe Biden (43%), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40%), and Gavin Newsom (39%).\u00a0Everyone tested was viewed more negatively than positively, although by only 2 points for both Harris and RFK Jr.",
      "The Russia-Ukraine conflict",
      "The continuing war between Russia and Ukraine takes a backseat to the conflict in the Middle East, with 72% saying the war matters a great deal to life in the U.S. compared to 81% who say the same about what is happening in the Middle East.",
      "Those saying the Russia-Ukraine war matters are down from 81% in October 2023 (when the question was last asked) and a high of 85% in March 2022 (at the start of the war).",
      "Even so, 56% of voters support sending money to Ukraine to help fight Russia.\u00a0That number has held steady at between 54 and 63% for the last three years.",
      "Big picture, majorities favor sending financial aid to the Ukrainians (56%) and the Israelis (53%) to fight their respective wars, with partisanship driving support in the different theaters.",
      "Seventy percent of Democrats support funding Ukraine compared to just 46% of Republicans, while 71% of Republicans favor sending aid to Israel compared to just 43% of Democrats.",

      "The bipartisan Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure (AFIDA) Improvements Act seeks to implement recommendations published by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2024, which found the AFIDA was ill-equipped to combat foreign ownership of American agricultural land.",
      "\"Communist China is our greatest geopolitical threat,\" Ricketts told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview, adding, \"This is a way for us to improve the disclosure that's going on with regard to the purchase of this agricultural land, so we can take other action if necessary to make sure we're not giving Communist China the opportunity to buy agricultural land.\"",
      "The bill's proposal comes as two Chinese nationals \u2013 a University of Michigan post-doctoral research fellow, Yunqing Jian, and Huazhong University of Science and Technology student Chengxuan Han \u2013 were held in federal custody after they were accused of smuggling biological materials into the United States.",

If ingested by humans, the substance can cause vomiting, liver damage and \"reproductive defects in humans and livestock.\"",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital that the Trump administration is focused on \"keeping our homeland secure\" through enhanced border screenings.",
      "\"Protecting America\u2019s food supply and national security remains a top priority. Last week\u2019s smuggling attempt by Chinese nationals of Fusarium graminearum, a dangerous crop-destroying fungus, posing a significant bioterrorism threat, only highlights this imperative to combat this threat,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "\"That could potentially be very damaging to agriculture,\" Ricketts told Fox News Digital. \"We also know that Chinese nationals have been trying to steal our biotechnology with regard to agriculture. They've also been crashing gates of bases. Supposed Chinese tourists have been flying drones around bases. Of course, the Chinese flew a surveillance balloon over our country when the Biden administration just let that happen.\"",
      "Ricketts said China has been aggressively buying American agriculture, \"which is why we need to have a heightened sense of vigilance around protecting our homeland.\"",

      "\"It's not just about the number of acres that they own, but the fact that they own it around Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota or Fort Liberty in North Carolina. They're buying it around sensitive military installations,\" Ricketts said.",
      "The bill, also co-sponsored by Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, John Cornyn of Texas, Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, requires AFIDA reporting for foreign persons holding more than 1% interest in American agricultural land.",
      "The AFIDA Improvements Act aims to increase information-sharing between the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States and the USDA. It also requires updates to the AFIDA's handbook and establishes a deadline for USDA to set up an online AFIDA system.",

      "Based on the GAO's recommendations, the bill seeks to update the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act of 1978 to better equip the USDA to combat foreign adversaries\u2019 ownership of American agricultural land.",
      "\"We are at the most dangerous point in our history right now since World War II,\" Ricketts said. \"We have to be investing in our military. We have to be supporting our friends around the world that are pushing back on these dictators. Communist China is one of them.\"",
      "Additionally, the bill comes as conflict in the Middle East reaches a boiling point between Iran and Israel, reigniting concerns about national security. Israel successfully coordinated attacks against Iran from inside the country, and Ricketts pointed to Ukraine's success in targeting a Russian air base.",

      "\"What Ukraine was able to do against Russia with their operation that destroyed some of their strategic bombers, and they placed trucks with drones close to an air base and had those drones attack their squadrons.

That should be very concerning to us,\" Ricketts said.",
      "Ricketts added that American farmland should not be a \"tool that our adversaries, like Communist China, can use to attack us from inside our own country.\"",
      "There has been little movement on the bill since it was just recently introduced. That is largely because Senate Republicans are narrowly focused on advancing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of digital threats, safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial. Android is responding with a suite of new security features designed to protect you from scams, fraud, and device theft.",
      "These enhancements are primarily rolling out to devices running Android 16. Some protections, such as enhanced theft protection and AI-powered scam detection, are also becoming available on select devices running Android 10 and later via Google Play Services updates.",
      "The most advanced features, including Identity Check and device-level Advanced Protection, are initially launching on Google Pixel and Samsung devices with One UI 7, with plans to expand to other manufacturers as they update to Android 16. Let's take a look at how these innovations are making Android security smarter and more comprehensive.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\u00a0free when you join.",
      "Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1. Smarter protections against phone call scams",
      "Phone scammers are becoming increasingly creative, often attempting to trick people into changing device security settings or granting risky permissions during calls. Android's new\u00a0in-call protections add a layer of defense by blocking certain actions during calls with non-contacts. For example, you won't be able to disable Google Play Protect, sideload an app for the first time, or grant accessibility permissions while on a call with someone not in your contacts. If you're screen-sharing during a call, Android will prompt you to stop sharing when the call ends.",

      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR ANDROIDS - CYBERGUY PICKS 2025",
      "2. Smarter scam detection in Google Messages",
      "Android's AI-powered\u00a0Scam Detection in Google Messages and Phone by Google is now even more intelligent. It can identify suspicious conversation patterns in real-time and warn you before you fall victim to a scam. This protection covers a wide range of scams, including toll road and billing fee scams, cryptocurrency scams, financial impersonation scams, gift card and prize scams, tech support scams, and more. All message analysis happens on your device, so your conversations stay private.",
      "Availability can vary depending on your device, region, and carrier. If you don't see these features yet, make sure your\u00a0app is updated and keep an eye out as Google continues to expand support to more users worldwide.",
      "Scam Detection (Google)",
      "3. Fighting fraud and impersonation with Key Verifier",
      "To help protect you from scammers who try to impersonate someone you know, Android is rolling out Key Verifier in Google Messages. This feature lets you and your contact verify each other's identity using public encryption keys, either by scanning a QR code or comparing numbers. If a contact's verification status changes, like after a SIM swap, you'll see a warning, giving you extra confidence that you're talking to the right person.",
      "Key Verifier (Google)",
      "4. Find Hub: Locating what matters most, from luggage to loved ones",
      "If you've ever used Android's\u00a0Find My Device to track down a lost phone or set of keys, you know how helpful it can be. Now, Find My Device is evolving into\u00a0Find Hub, making it easier to keep track of your devices, family, and friends all in one place, with more partner brands joining the network.",
      "Find Hub is also becoming more personalized. Whether you want built-in luggage tracking from\u00a0July and\u00a0Mokobara, ski protection with\u00a0Peak integration, or Disney-themed Bluetooth tags from Pixbee, there are options to suit different needs. Soon, tags that are enabled with ultra-wideband, starting with moto tag, will provide improved nearby location tracking.",
      "Later this year, Find Hub will include satellite connectivity, allowing you to stay connected with friends and family even when cellular service is unavailable. For travelers, new partnerships with airlines such as Aer Lingus, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Iberia, and Singapore Airlines will let you share your Bluetooth tag's location directly with these airlines. This should make recovering lost luggage easier and less stressful.",

The new\u00a0Identity Check adds an extra layer of security if your PIN or password is compromised, and it's rolling out to more devices with Android 16.\u00a0Factory Reset Protection is getting tougher, restricting all functionalities on devices reset without the owner's authorization.\u00a0Remote Lock now includes a security challenge question to prevent unauthorized use, and one-time passwords will be hidden on the lock screen in higher-risk scenarios.",

      "For those who want even stronger security,\u00a0Advanced Protection is now available as a device-level setting in Android 16. This combines Google's most robust security tools, like intrusion logging and scam call detection, into one setting that can't be turned off without unenrolling.",
      "Whether you're a journalist, a public figure, or just want extra peace of mind, Android 16 makes it easy to activate Advanced Protection. This suite of features brings together Google's top security tools, like Intrusion Logging, USB protection, and scam detection for calls, into one powerful setting.

      "Note: After activation, these protections cannot be turned off without unenrolling from Advanced Protection.",
      "Advanced Protection (Google)",
      "Optional: Review additional settings",
      "You can review and adjust related security settings within the Advanced Protection menu, such as app permissions and network controls, as new features become available. If you don't see the option, make sure your device is updated to Android 16 and check for any additional requirements, such as a Google account or specific device compatibility. Some features may require additional verification steps, like using a security key or two-factor authentication, especially if you're enrolling for the first time or on a new device.",

      "Install strong antivirus software: This adds another layer of defense against malware and suspicious apps. Google Play Protect, which is built-in malware protection for Android devices, automatically removes known malware. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough.

So, you may want to choose a strong antivirus app and keep it updated for maximum protection.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Keep your device updated: Always install the latest\u00a0Android updates to patch any security vulnerabilities. Updates often include important security fixes that protect against new threats. To do this, go to\u00a0Settings, tap\u00a0System or\u00a0About phone, select\u00a0Software update or\u00a0System update, then tap\u00a0Download and Install if an update is available.",
      "Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Avoid reusing passwords across different accounts to reduce the risk if one is compromised. Consider a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Be cautious with app permissions: Only grant apps the permissions they truly need. Review permissions regularly and revoke any that seem unnecessary or intrusive.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Enable two-factor authentication: This adds an extra step to your logins, making it more difficult for others to access your accounts. Most major apps and services offer this feature in their security settings.",
      "Download apps only from the Google Play Store: Avoid third-party stores, which are more likely to host unsafe apps. The Play Store has security checks that help reduce the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "Regularly review your privacy settings: Make sure you're comfortable with what you're sharing. Adjust settings to limit data sharing and enhance your privacy whenever possible.",
      "Consider a personal data removal service: Scammers often start by gathering information about you from public records and data broker sites. Using a personal data removal service can help scrub your personal details from these sites, making it much harder for scammers to target you. If you're concerned about your privacy or just want to take your security to the next level, this is a smart step to consider.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Keeping your phone and personal data secure is more important than ever, but Android is making it easier to stay protected with smarter scam detection, new ways to keep track of your devices and loved ones, and the strongest security features yet. By taking a few extra steps, like using strong passwords, keeping your device updated, and considering a personal data removal service, you're adding even more layers of protection against evolving threats. Security is always changing, but with these tools and habits, you can use your Android device with greater confidence and peace of mind.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal have changed how we move money. They are fast and convenient, but with that ease comes exposure. If you send funds to the wrong person, they are likely gone for good. There is often no real path to recovery, especially when the recipient disappears behind a fake username and an unresponsive support system.",
      "This vulnerability becomes even more dangerous in moments of crisis. During natural disasters, high-profile social movements, or health emergencies, people are moved to give. Scammers know this and exploit the impulse. One such scam involved a fake Venmo account pretending to collect donations for a Minnesota nonprofit after the death of George Floyd. The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana. Scammers have created a fraudulent Venmo account that closely mimics the legitimate Venmo handle of the cancer nonprofit organization. They are using this fake account to trick well-meaning donors into sending money, believing they are supporting the real charity.",

      "Instead of helping, Venmo routed Rinaldi through generic FAQs and legal disclaimers. Even after he was connected with a live support agent, the responses were standard scripts. He was told that the issue had been escalated, but no one could provide a timeline beyond a vague window of three to five business days.",

Take a known nonprofit, tweak the username slightly, and ride the momentum of goodwill. By the time anyone catches on, the money is gone and the damage is done.",
      "The incident involving MPCS is not an isolated case. In December 2024, Final Victory Animal Rescue, a nonprofit based in South Carolina,\u00a0discovered a Venmo account impersonating the organization and collecting donations intended for the real charity.

      "Scammers aren\u2019t just targeting charities. They\u2019re after anyone and everyone. Here are a few ways to protect yourself and keep your hard-earned money safe.",
      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details. By scrubbing your data from these sources, you lower your risk of being targeted in payment app scams and reduce the likelihood that someone could impersonate you or a nonprofit you care about.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "4) Create a strong, unique and complex password for each of your mobile payment apps and change it often. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says Hugging Face has launched affordable open-source humanoid robots for home AI exploration.",
      "Hugging Face, a well-known name in AI development, is making big moves in the world of robotics. The company has just introduced two open-source humanoid robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini, designed to make advanced robotics more accessible to everyone, from researchers and developers to students and hobbyists.",

      "Meet HopeJR: The full-size humanoid for real-world tasks",
      "HopeJR is\u00a0Hugging Face's new full-size humanoid robot. It stands out for its impressive 66 actuated degrees of freedom. This means it can walk, move its arms, and perform a wide range of independent gestures, making it a versatile platform for research, experimentation, and even household tasks in the future. Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000. That is a fraction of what most full-scale humanoid robots cost, opening the door for smaller labs, schools, and dedicated enthusiasts to get involved in advanced robotics development.",

This desktop robot stands about 11 inches tall and is packed with features, including a camera, microphone, speaker, and a full six-degree-of-freedom neck for expressive movement. It can move its head, listen, speak, and interact with AI applications, making it a fun and practical tool for developers and educators alike.",
      "Reachy Mini is expected to cost between $250 and $300. It is designed to be a hands-on gateway into robotics, letting users build, customize, and experiment with embodied AI. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with Hugging Face Spaces, giving access to over 500,000 AI apps on the Hugging Face Hub.",

      "Why open source matters in robotics",
      "Both HopeJR and Reachy Mini are fully open source. This means anyone can assemble, rebuild, and understand how these robots work. Hugging Face's CEO, Clem Delangue, emphasized that this approach helps keep robotics open and accessible rather than dominated by a handful of companies with proprietary black-box systems. The community-driven model encourages collaboration and innovation, allowing users to share their improvements and build on each other's work.",

      "This expansion into robotics builds on Hugging Face's recent acquisition of\u00a0Pollen Robotics, the creators of the original Reachy robot. That partnership gave Hugging Face the expertise needed to accelerate hardware development and bring these new robots to market quickly.",

      "Just ask \"Pamela,\" who wrote to us: \"I thought I couldn't be scammed, but I almost was.\"",

      "Facebook scam warning: How Pamela almost fell for a tech support hoax",
      "\"I was working on my Facebook and it suddenly had a screen flash and voice that said the computer was locked and I needed to call a number to report the breach. I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",
      "\"I have great virus software on all my devices and use two-step authentication for almost everything - but I still almost fell for it. I'm sharing this story to help others.\"",
      "Pamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.",
      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

      "Check URLs carefully before you click them, and use strong antivirus software",
      "Verify links before clicking them, especially if they come from someone who randomly contacted you on the internet. Scammers often use URLs that look similar to legitimate sites, but they typically contain slight misspellings or different domains (e.g., payepal.com or Microsoft.xyz). Also, install and update strong antivirus software.Protect all your devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones, with strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Be cautious with personal information on social media",
      "Think twice before sharing personal details, such as your birthday, address, or even your pet's name. Scammers can use information from your social media profiles to guess passwords or craft personalized\u00a0phishing attacks.",

      "Don't limit\u00a0MFA to just your main accounts. Enable it wherever possible, including email, social media, and financial services. Multifactor authentication adds an extra step to the login process, making it significantly harder for scammers to gain access, even if they have your password.",
      "Use a personal data removal service to clean up your online footprint",
      "Scammers often scour the internet for your personal information. Using a personal data removal service can help reduce the amount of your sensitive data available online, making it harder for scammers to target you with convincing attacks. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Monitor your bank accounts, credit cards, and credit reports for any unusual or unauthorized activity. Early detection is key. If you spot something suspicious, report it immediately to your financial institution and the proper authorities.",
      "Back up your important data regularly",
      "Ransomware and other attacks can lock you out of your files. Regularly\u00a0back up your important data to an external hard drive or a secure cloud service. This ensures you can recover your information if your device is compromised.",
      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Keep in mind that scammers are constantly evolving their tactics. You must always be on guard. Do not rely too heavily on technology to protect you, since there is a psychological aspect to their methods as well. Have a skeptical mindset and trust your instincts. By sharing experiences and staying informed, we strengthen our community's defense against cybercrime.",

      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names.

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",
      "Physicist Klaus Lackner, at left, and Eric Dahlgren, co-founder and CEO of Aircela, at right\u00a0\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.",

      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",

People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks.

      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",

      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

      "The purpose of seeking a humanities education is to learn the great texts and ideas that have stirred the soul of civilization since antiquity. It is a discipline that teaches reverence for nuance, a chastened appreciation of history, and intellectual humility. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the keynote speech at UCLA\u2019s recent Humanities commencement ceremonies.",
      "Caribbean Fragoza took to the podium donning a keffiyeh, declaring \"From the river to the sea\" (a slogan widely recognized as a call for the eradication of Israel and the Jews within it) and delivering a lesson in solipsism and sophistry. This hateful message emboldened the audience to boo when graduates in Jewish Studies and Hebrew were called to the stage.",
      "ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS TORCH DIPLOMAS OUTSIDE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ON GRADUATION DAY",
      "Fragoza\u2019s speech was laced not with intellectual nuance, but with the rhetorical certitudes of the picket line. She introduced the issue of Palestine, without irony, by recalling an episode in which she explained a watermelon-themed art project to her five-year-old with the words \"Free Palestine.\" She submitted the child\u2019s understanding of the issue as proof of its moral simplicity. But what she actually revealed was that the epistemology of a kindergartner animates her schema.",

      "The graduating class, supposedly trained in reasoned disagreement, great ideas, and the study of virtue ethics, responded with eruptive applause. The same crowd that spent their college years hosting illegal encampments centered around the idea that \"anti-Zionism\" isn\u2019t antisemitism, booed Jewish and Hebrew studies when the departments were called after hearing the words \"Free Palestine.\"",
      "Fragoza signposted her hateful message well before taking the podium. The keffiyeh she wore is not some neutral garment, or some multicultural kumbaya accessory. Following the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, it has become a political symbol\u2014one inseparable from Arab nationalism -- that grew in popularity after the 1936\u201339 Arab Revolt. Yet, when Fragoza arrived draped in a keffiyeh, no dean or faculty member stopped to ask whether graduation was the time for political costume.",
      "Police and protesters clash at UCLA (Getty Images)",
      "The speech itself was rife with hatred and hyperbole. Jews know too well that the chant \"From the river to the sea\" is not a poetic abstraction but a blunt instrument of maximalist ambition, calling for the elimination of the world\u2019s only Jewish state.",
      "When Fragoza sought to subtly liken Donald Trump to a fascist, no administrator wondered whether such commentary, directed at a graduating class that likely includes many Trump supporters, was divisive or inflammatory.",
      "And when she declared that \"brown\" students, regardless of immigration status, could expect to be rounded up and deported at the state\u2019s discretion, no professor flagged it as the straw-man fallacy it so clearly was. Instead, political hyperbole became the university\u2019s parting message to its students.",
      "The animating metaphor of Fragoza\u2019s speech was fire. She invoked the Rodney King riots not as a tragedy, not even as a cautionary tale, but as a righteous blaze. She affectionately recalled the looting of \"free TVs\" as though they were trophies of justice.",
      "It's becoming commonplace: Families that travel great distances to honor their loved ones are often subjected to such political theater. Gone are the days of Mary Schmich\u2019s \"Wear Sunscreen\" speech, when graduation speeches were meant to celebrate or inspire. The UCLA students received a sendoff soaked in paranoia and propaganda. For Jewish students, including some who did not know whether their loved ones in Israel had survived Iran\u2019s recent missile barrage targeting civilians, it was all too raw.",
      "That such rhetoric passed without objection is not merely a failure of decorum. It is an indictment of the academy itself. Nor was this an isolated incident. At UCLA\u2019s many graduation ceremonies this weekend, it was the norm.",
      "When student leaders read the School of Public Health's oath, students in the crowd chanted \"except in Palestine\" in call-and-response, without reprimand. According to an official club in the School of Public Health\u2019s social media, a bulletin was passed out to graduating students declaring \"ACAB,\" the acronym for \"All Cops Are Bastards,\" \"All I.C.E. melts eventually,\" and \"THE STRUGGLE FOR PALESTINAN LIBERATION IS ANTIRACISM WORK.\"",

      "Staff Sgt. Garrett Butts is helping lead the charge by building smarter, cheaper unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in-house for the battlefield.",
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Tuesday, Butts described how his team is creating drone technology from scratch, often using parts it took nearly a year to legally obtain.",
      "\"We're a transformation and contact unit,\" said Butts, who serves with the 1st Cavalry Division. \"We\u2019ve been charged with innovating our own SUAS (small unmanned aircraft systems) platforms in-house to cut procurement costs and timelines.\"",

      "These systems are meant to keep up with modern war, which is changing faster than the military\u2019s normal supply process.",
      "One of the biggest challenges has been simply getting the parts. Butts said his team had to spend nine months figuring out how to legally purchase drone components because of strict procurement rules.",

      "\"Put a camera up, look at the objective or look over an obstacle\u2026 to ensure their safety,\" he said. \"Those are the biggest winning factors of our SUAS systems.\"",

Right now, drone operators need advanced navigation training, which takes time and is hard to maintain.",

      "As Israel\u2019s battle to take out Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities continues, Iran\u2019s most heavily-protected nuclear facility at Fordow, two hours from Tehran, remains intact.",
      "Many military analysts believe that a two-ton precision bunker buster developed by and in sole possession of the U.S. is the only means of eliminating the Fordow site, which some claim may be capable of producing a nuclear warhead in as little as two to three days.",
      "Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, spoke with Fox News Digital about bunker-busters, and how Israel or the U.S. might use them to eliminate the Fordow nuclear threat.",

      "Illustration showing how a GBU-57 Bunker Buster is deployed. (Fox News\u00a0)",
      "Ruhe said bunker busters are munitions designed to use the force of gravity to \"penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes\" underground. The explosion may either take out the target fully, or \"collapse the structure\" around the target \"without necessarily obliterating it,\" he explained.",
      "Bunker busters come in multiple weight classes. Israel possesses 2,000- and 5,000-pound varieties. Only the U.S. possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordinance Penetrator (MOP).",
      "Developed under President George W. Bush, Ruhe says the MOP was \"designed specifically\" for targets like Fordow, where nuclear sites or command and control bunkers are hidden far underground.",
      "Two separate bombs are dropped by a B2 Spirit stealth bomber. (Fox News)",
      "Ruhe said that the number of munitions required to target Fordow depends on the depth of the facility. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies states that Fordow\u2019s facility is between 60 and 90 meters (196 to 295 feet) below ground. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi told The Financial Times last week that the facility reaches 800 meters underground.",

      "The illustration shows the first bomb exploding and creating a hole. (Fox News)",
      "The MOP is said to have a penetration depth of 200 feet. Ruhe said that given Fordow\u2019s distance underground and the difficulty of penetrating the rocky mountainside the site is dug into, the U.S. would likely use a technique called burrowing, in which a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber would \"drop several MOPs in succession, one after the other.\"",
      "Fordow poses a unique target. Ruhe said that pilots have to take into account the facility\u2019s multiple, narrow exit tunnels, and achieve the right angle of impact to penetrate the ground.",
      "Though Israeli air dominance over Iran has eliminated the need for stealth air assets, Ruhe believes the stealth B-2 would be the only tool adequate for delivering the MOPs. Ruhe said timing constraints make the use of B-52 bombers \"not relevant.\"",
      "Additionally, Ruhe explained that talk of loaning B-2 bombers to the Israeli Air Force is \"a dangerous distraction.\" Not only is there \"0.0% chance\" that the U.S. would give out this strategic capability, but Ruhe says training Israeli pilots to fly the B-2 would take several months.",

      "Given that Israel is \"very tactically inventive\" and \"very good at maximizing the capabilities they do have,\" Ruhe says that Israel could achieve its goals at Fordow without the MOP.",
      "Not only did Ruhe offer the unlikely but not impossible scenario where Israel might \"storm the site in a commando raid,\" but he said that Israel could use F-15s, escorted by F-35s, to deliver multiple 5,000-pound bunker busters over Fordow, utilizing the same burrowing tactic the U.S. would likely employ.",

      "The U.S. and Israel are likely to have different goals in targeting Fordow, Ruhe said. \"Americans tend to think of obliterating targets,\" Ruhe said, whereas Israel would \"probably be fine with saying they knocked back the operations there by a year or so.\"",
      "Ruhe estimates that the bunker busters may not completely destroy the facility, but that it may be considered a success if it were to knock out the power source to Iranian centrifuges, or making \"the air too polluted\" for centrifuges to operate.",

    "story": [
      "A group of foreign policy and security experts have compiled a report looking at a solution for a \"day after\" plan in Gaza, and believe private security contractors, which have heavy experience in the Mideast could be a solution to replace Hamas.",
      "The question of a \"day after\" plan in the Gaza Strip has plagued negotiations between Israel, the U.S., Arab nations and Hamas for months and has ultimately led to the terrorist network\u2019s refusal to release the 55 hostages still held there.",
      "However, foreign policy leaders and security experts based in Washington may have the key that could provide a solution to help rebuild the war-torn Gaza Strip where others cannot: private security contractors (PSC).",
      "PSCs, which have heavy experience in the Middle East and decades of lessons learned to draw from, could be used as non-state actors to provide stability and a path forward for the Palestinians, but they would have to start with humanitarian aid, John Hannah, former national security advisor to Dick Cheney and current Randi & Charles Wax senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told Fox News Digital.",
      "Palestinians continue their daily lives under harsh conditions amid the rubble of destroyed buildings in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza following the enforcement of a ceasefire agreement on Feb. 10, 2025. (Mahmoud ssa/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "ISRAEL OBJECTS TO FOREIGN NATIONS SANCTIONING ITS OFFICIALS",
      "In a plan hatched out following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the subsequent outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip, a group of eight members with JINSA and the Vandenberg Coalition comprised a report that detailed how the handling of humanitarian aid could completely change security in the region.",
      "The plan, in part, initially looked similar to the mechanism known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by the U.S. and Israel, and which launched last month to distribute aid to Palestinians.",
      "However, the plan comprised by Hannah and the team took it a step further and argued that these aid actors should also be involved in rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"We thought humanitarian issues was the best way [forward],\" Hannah said.\u00a0\"It was the common denominator that would allow all of the major stakeholders that want to get to a better \u2018day after\u2019 \u2013 Israel, the United States, the key pragmatic Arab states \u2013 they all could agree that we can't agree on a political vision for Palestine 10 years from now, and the issue of a Palestinian state, but we can all agree on this apple pie and motherhood issue that we don't want to see starving, suffering Palestinians.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge in a show of strength, escorting Red Cross vehicles carrying three Israeli hostages to be released as part of the ceasefire deal. (TPS-IL)",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had already detailed the need to eliminate Hamas following the deadliest-ever attack on Israel, but the group of eight experts also identified that aid, long used by Hamas to maintain power by using it to incentivize support and recruitment, and to punish opposition, needed to be the key to cementing actual change.",
      "\"We needed a solution on humanitarian aid,\" Hannah said. \"And when we looked around the world, who could do this, take over the humanitarian aid? We were left with one option.\"",

      "\"We didn't think it should be the Israel Defense Forces. Israel lacks legitimacy with the Palestinian population, and frankly, it had its hands full doing the military job of defeating Hamas,\" he added. \u00a0\"American forces weren't going to do it. We didn't think Arab forces would step up and do this. And the U.N. system as it existed under UNRWA was illegitimate in the eyes of Israel.\"",
      "The group not only briefed the Biden and Netanyahu administrations on the proposal, but held numerous discussions with Israeli officials in 2024 on how such a plan could work.",
      "Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero \u2013 who served as deputy chief of staff, Strategic Operations for Multinational Forces-Iraq for 2007-2008 and who was tasked by Gen. David Petraeus to create a system of accountability over PSCs in Iraq following the Blackwater incident in September 2007 known as the Nisour Square massacre \u2013 also briefed Israeli officials on how a PSC mechanism could work in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Progress on the proposal appeared to stall by summer last year as then-President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were at increasing loggerheads over humanitarian concerns and mounting civilian Palestinian death tolls.",
      "However, Hannah questioned whether the seed had been planted with Israel by the time the Trump administration re-entered office, enabling the GHF to come in and start distributing aid.",
      "The GHF, though it has distributed over 16 million meals since it began operations in late May, saw a chaotic start with starving Palestinians rushing certain sites and reports of violence unfolding.",

      "THERE'S A WAY TO AID GAZA. I KNOW, MY FOUNDATION JUST HELPED DELIVER 7 MILLION MEALS... WITHOUT INCIDENT",
      "Though the reports of the level of chaos have reportedly been exaggerated by Hamas \u2013 which ultimately would benefit from the GHF\u2019s failure as experts have explained \u2013 the group initially drew some criticism over transparency concerns, though the group has been looking to remedy this with regal updates.",
      "The group, which saw its third leadership in as many weeks earlier this month, told Fox News Digital that despite some frustration among world leaders and aid groups, its goal is to work with major organizations like the United Nations and others to better distribute aid across Gaza where those programs are still flagging.",

      "Though while Washington backs the effort, State Department spokeperson Tammy Bruce has repeatedly made clear that the GHF is \"an independent organization\" that \"does not receive U.S. government funding.\"",
      "However, she has also refused to confirm whether any U.S. officials are working for the program.",
      "PSCs have a storied history in the Middle East, and not only the U.S. war on terror. They have been used by nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which could lend them a level of acceptance that would not be attainable by another force.",
      "The proposal issued by Hannah and his colleagues took the use of PSCs one step beyond humanitarian aid and argued they could make a positive impact in the actual reconstruction of the Gaza Strip \u2013 an idea that was also presented to the Trump administration this year.",
      "Displaced Palestinians wait to receive a free meal from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025. (Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's not at all foreign to these Arab parties that you might employ PSCs for certain critical missions,\" Hannah said. \"Our idea was, let's scale it up. Let's unify the effort. Let's have America and the Arabs lead it.",
      "\"The Arabs would put in most of the humanitarian aid workers, a lot of the financing, and then they would hire some of these international PSCs with a lot of experience to come in and protect those operations,\" he explained. \"You'd have the Arabs engaged, which we thought was absolutely critical.\"",
      "The plan also included bringing in other international aid organizations that would work with these PSCs to expand developments like housing projects, community development and infrastructure repair to restore electricity and water.",
      "\"And eventually, hopefully, begin to identify new leadership, local leadership in Gaza, who would be prepared to cooperate with the operations of this nonprofit entity,\" Hannah said. \"Local Gazans of goodwill, who wanted to be rid of Hamas, who this entity could provide some support to, some protection to so they can, could begin rebuilding Gaza civil administration.\"",

      "The plan also addressed the perpetual question of how to deter the next generation of Hamas terrroirsts, particularly amid Israeli military operations.",
      "Hannah argued this issue could be addressed by simultaneously training a \"non-Hamas new Palestinian, local Palestinian security force\" that would not only have the trust of the local population but could also gain the trust of Israel.",

      "But a strike in itself would not be a one-and-done job, military experts say.",
      "\u201cSo you have two challenges. You would have to drop two of these penetrators at the exact same site\u201d and likely need multiple bombing rounds, according to David Des Roches, a professor and senior military fellow at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cAnd then you would never be precisely sure how much of the facility you\u2019ve damaged,\u201d he added, meaning personnel may need to be deployed on the ground.",
      "\u201cThis leads me to believe that for those facilities, Israel will ultimately gain control of the air and then land forces on the ground, force their way into the facility by detonating the doors, and then go and place explosive charges, exfiltrate whatever intelligence they can get, and just detonate it from the inside,\u201d Des Roches told CNBC.",
      "Wider war for America?",
      "Iran\u2019s military capabilities have been severely degraded over the past few days by Israeli attacks, which have taken out substantial parts of its air defenses, ballistic missile batteries, command-and-control nodes and dozens of top commanders.",
      "Still, such a strike by the U.S. could trigger Iran to respond by striking at U.S. assets in the region like embassies and military bases. Trump has made clear that any attack on U.S. personnel would draw a fierce American response, which would then pull the world\u2019s most powerful military more deeply into a regional conflict.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have signaled that they are ready to attack U.S. bases in the region in the event of a U.S. attack on their domestic soil,\u201d said Gregory Brew, senior analyst on Iran and energy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noting that American bases in Iraq are particularly vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThere are risks in that environment that an Iranian retaliation causes U.S. casualties, kills U.S. servicemen, and potentially compels President Trump to expand the scope of U.S. action and order additional strikes on Iran and that, of course, would threaten general escalation and drag us into not just a single operation, but potentially a protracted air campaign.\u201d",
      "Despite its enormous scale, the GPU-57 bunker buster would not create wide-scale damage beyond the area of the facility, Des Roches said. But it would have a \u201cprofound psychological effect on the Iranians,\u201d he added, who have already seen significant damage and radioactive contamination risk wrought to the infrastructure of several of their nuclear sites in other parts of the country.",
      "A further critical question remains whether the Trump administration will limit itself to targeting nuclear sites, or whether it will expand operations beyond that \u2014 something Israel\u2019s government has also been urging, as it conveys its desire to see regime change for its longtime adversary.",
      "\u201cI think the conflict will end when Israel is confident that Iran has lost, for a significant period of time, the ability to make a nuclear weapon, and that its defenses are weakened enough that Israel will be able to go back and effectively disrupt any further effort by Iran to make a nuclear weapon,\u201d Des Roches argued.",
      "If Fordo remains operational, Israel\u2019s attacks would barely slow Iran\u2019s ability to build a bomb, nuclear analysts say. The decisions from the While House in the coming days will therefore prove decisive not only for the trajectory of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but for the survivability of the Islamic Republic\u2019s regime as a whole.",
      "Ali Vaez, Iran project director at nonprofit Crisis Group, believes that \u201cIran can survive and rebuild its nuclear program,\u201d even without a diplomatic avenue for a deal with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. entering the war will close the door on diplomacy,\u201d Vaez told CNBC. \u201cTrump might be able to destroy Fordow, but he won\u2019t be able to bomb away the knowledge that Iran has already acquired.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Right-wing media personality Tucker Carlson clashed with Sen. Ted Cruz in an interview and posted a clip Tuesday night in which the senator was unable to answer questions about Iran.",
      "\"How many people live in Iran, by the way?\" Carlson asked Cruz, R-Texas.",
      "\"I don't know the population,\" Cruz responded.",
      "\"At all?\" Carlson asked, prompting Cruz to reiterate that he did not know. \"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\"",
      "Asked again how he did not know Iran's population, the senator responded, \"I don't sit around memorizing population tables.\" (The CIA estimated in 2024 that the country's population level was 88 million.)",
      "The clip immediately caught fire online, with Carlson's post racking up more than 20 million views and thousands of comments by morning, according to X analytics.",
      "The clash underscores a broader split within the MAGA movement over U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran. One faction of the movement, including Carlson, has urged against U.S. intervention, painting the other side as \"warmongers.\" The more hawkish faction, which includes Cruz, has forcefully supported the United States backing Israel's efforts.",
      "President Donald Trump is weighing what he will do next, with a senior administration official telling NBC News on Wednesday morning that \"all options remain on the table.\" Asked about potential U.S. strikes against Iran, Trump told reporters Wednesday, \"I may do it, I may not do it.\"",
      "Cruz said in a Fox News interview Sunday that he believed \u201cit is very much in the interest of America to see regime change\u201d in Iran.",
      "Also included in the clip of Carlson's interview, which aired in full on Wednesday, the former Fox News host argued that Cruz's knowledge about Iran's population was \"kind of relevant because you're calling for the overthrow of the government.\"",
      "Moments later, Carlson asked Cruz for the ethnic mix of Iran.",
      "\"They are Persians and predominantly Shia,\" Cruz said, referring to a sect of Islam.",
      "Carlson cut in to ask for percentages and Cruz retorted, \"this is cute\" as the two men talked over each other. (Persians are Iran's largest ethnic group, but the country also has Azeri, Kurd, Lur and other groups, according to the CIA.)",
      "\"You don't know anything about Iran,\" Carlson said, and the interview devolved into a heated, overlapping exchange.",
      "\"If you\u2019re calling for toppling a government, it\u2019s incumbent on you to know something about the country and to think through the consequences of that, and you haven\u2019t and you don\u2019t,\" Carlson said shortly after. \"And I\u2019m saying that\u2019s reckless.\"",
      "Cruz retorted, saying Carlson engages in \"reckless rhetoric with no facts.\"",
      "After the clip was published, Cruz accused Carlson on X of releasing \"a snippet playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran.\"",
      "\"I declined to play that silly game,\" he continued, encouraging people to watch the full interview when it airs.",
      "Cruz has posted over a dozen times defending himself and attacking Carlson in the hours since the first clip was posted.",
      "\"Tucker Carlson is obsessed with defending Russia and the KGB thug that runs it,\" he wrote in one post. In another, he said, \"I emphatically support killing terrorists who seek to kill Americans \u2014 that\u2019s America First. Tucker Carlson does not. Why?\"",
      "The two-hour interview was contentious, with the two men frequently arguing and cutting each other off as they debated foreign policy perspectives. They frequently accused each other of being reckless, dishonest or inconsistent.",
      "Most of the conversation centered on Cruz's perspective on how the U.S. should respond to the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "\"I would oppose invading Iran and putting boots on the ground to topple the government,\" Cruz said. \"If the risk got severe enough, I would support that, but I think the relative risk is not severe enough to justify that step at this time.\"",
      "Carlson characterized his perspective by saying that \"we should be very careful about entering into more foreign wars that don\u2019t help us when our country is dying.\"",
      "Trump has weighed in on Carlson's criticism of potential U.S. strikes on Iran, calling the former Fox News host \"kooky.\"",
      "\"Somebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that,\u201d IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday before the interview clip was posted on  X.",
      "Asked by a reporter Monday for his response to Carlson calling Trump \"complicit\" in the conflict with Iran, Trump said, \"I don\u2019t know what Tucker Carlson is saying. Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\" Carlson left Fox News in 2023."

      "The Federal Reserve has left its key interest rate unchanged for its fourth-straight meeting.",
      "The upshot for consumers: The cost to borrow money \u2014 whether  through credit cards, for auto loans or mortgages \u2014 won't be changing substantially anytime soon.",
      "The Federal Reserve sets the benchmark interest rate for all other borrowing rates in the U.S. economy. This is known as the federal funds rate.",
      "Right now, the federal funds rate target sits at between 4.25% and 4.5%. To be sure, the Fed does not directly control interest rates for consumer borrowing, but the federal funds rate serves as a type of baseline for the way banks set their own interest rates for customers seeking credit and loans.",
      "It's why the average credit card annual percentage rate (APR) has been stuck at about 25% for as long as the Fed has been holding its key rate at the current levels \u2014 about six months.",
      "So why has the Fed been keeping interest rates at this level for so long?",
      "The central bank is tasked by Congress with keeping both unemployment and the pace of price growth, or inflation, in check. To do so, it uses the federal funds rate to control demand for goods and services in the economy \u2014\u00a0much of which rely on borrowing.",
      "When the Fed fears businesses have been too aggressive in raising prices in response to strong demand, it raises the cost of borrowing to cool that demand down. It's what happened when the Fed hiked interest rates to the highest levels in more than a decade in 2023 in response to surging price growth as the economy roared back to life from the pandemic.",
      "Since then, inflation has cooled substantially. So much so, in fact, that President Donald Trump has begun to pester the Fed about cutting the federal funds rate.",
      "Yet the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation remains above its 2% target and, its policymakers say, risks moving higher because of Trump's tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he expects the cost of most tariffs to ultimately be passed through to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "There are risks to keeping rates elevated, however. Reducing overall demand in the economy makes companies less inclined to hire workers. Already, there are signs that the labor market is weakening, though there remains debate about just how much at this moment.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out of work, it\u2019s hard to find a job, but there are very few people who are being laid off at this point,\u201d Powell said Wednesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully.\u201d",
      "But overall, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty good labor market.\u201d",
      "For now, analysts say the Fed remains in wait-and-see mode.  Officially, the Fed estimates that it may cut the interest rate two times by the end of this year.",
      "Powell said he anticipates learning more about the impact from tariffs this summer. But he also said there is not a lot of \u201cconviction\u201d among Fed policymakers about where things could go.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to weaken,\u201d Powell said Wednesday, referring to the economy, adding that \u201ceventually it will \u2014 but we don\u2019t see signs of it now.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he said that addressing the problem of child sexual abuse material on the platform was his \u201ctop priority.\u201d Three years later, the problem appears to be escalating, as anonymous, seemingly automated X accounts flood hashtags with hundreds of posts per hour advertising the sale of the illegal material.",
      "At the same time, Thorn, a California-based nonprofit that works with tech companies to provide technology that can detect and address child sexual abuse content, told NBC News that it had terminated its contract with X.",
      "Thorn said that X stopped paying recent invoices for its work, though it declined to provide details about its deal with the company citing legal sensitivities. X said on Wednesday that it was moving toward using its own technology to address the spread of child abuse material.",
      "Some of Thorn\u2019s tools are designed to address the very issue that appears to be growing on the platform.",
      "\u201cWe recently terminated our contract with X due to nonpayment,\u201d Cassie Coccaro, head of communications at Thorn, told NBC News. \u201cAnd that was after months and months of outreach, flexibility, trying to make it work. And ultimately we had to stop the contract.\u201d",
      "Many aspects of the child exploitation ads issue, which NBC News first reported on in January 2023, remain the same on the platform. Sellers of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) continue to use hashtags based on sexual keywords to advertise to people looking to buy CSAM. Their posts direct prospective buyers to other platforms where users are asked for money in return for the child abuse material.",
      "Other aspects are new: Some accounts now appear to be automated (also known as bots), while others have taken advantage of \u201cCommunities,\u201d a relatively new feature launched in 2021 that encourages X users to congregate in groups \u201ccloser to the discussions they care about most.\u201d Using Communities, CSAM advertisers have been able to post into groups of tens of thousands of people devoted to topics like incest, seemingly without much scrutiny.",
      "The Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P), an independent online CSAM watchdog group, reviewed several X accounts and hashtags flagged by NBC News that were promoting the sale of CSAM, and followed links promoted by several of the accounts. The organization said that, within minutes, it was able to identify accounts that posted images of previously identified CSAM victims who were as young as 7. It also found apparent images of CSAM in thumbnail previews populated on X and in links to Telegram channels where CSAM videos were posted. One such channel showed a video of a boy estimated to be as young as 4 being sexually assaulted. NBC News did not view or have in its possession any of the abuse material.",
      "Lloyd Richardson, director of information technology at C3P, said the behavior being exhibited by the X users was \u201ca bit old hat\u201d at this point, and that X\u2019s response \u201chas been woefully insufficient.\u201d \u201cIt seems to be a little bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole that goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a particular push to really get to the root cause of the issue.\u201dX says it has a zero tolerance policy \u201ctowards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for X directed NBC News to a post from its @Safety account detailing what the company says are new efforts to find and remove child abuse material.",
      "\u201cAt X, we have zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation in any form. Until recently, we leveraged partnerships that helped us along the way,\u201d the company said in the post. \u201cWe are proud to provide an important update on our continuous work detecting Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) content, announcing today that we have launched additional CSAM hash matching efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis system allows X to hash and match media content quickly and securely, keeping the platform safer without sacrificing user privacy,\u201d the post continued. \u201cThis is enabled by the incredible work of our safety engineering team, who have built state of the art systems to further strengthen our enforcement capabilities.\u201d",
      "The company said that the system would allow the company to automatically detect known CSAM and remove it, though it was not clear how it differs from existing hashing technology.",
      "The spokesperson did not respond to questions about Thorn's allegations regarding the payments.",
      "A review of many hashtags with terms known to be associated with CSAM shows that the problem is, if anything, worse than when Musk initially took over. What was previously a trickle of posts of fewer than a dozen per hour is now a torrent propelled by accounts that appear to be automated \u2014 some posting several times a minute.",
      "Despite the continued flood of posts and sporadic bans of individual accounts, the hashtags observed by NBC News over several weeks remained open and viewable as of Wednesday. And some of the hashtags that were identified in 2023 by NBC News as hosting the child exploitation advertisements are still being used for the same purpose today.",
      "Historically, Twitter and then X have attempted to block certain hashtags associated with child exploitation. When NBC News first reported on the use of X to market CSAM, X\u2019s head of trust and safety said the company knew it had work to do and would be making changes, including the development of automated systems to detect and block hashtags.",
      "In January 2024, X CEO Linda Yaccarino testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the company had strengthened its enforcement \u201cwith more tools and technology to prevent bad actors from distributing, searching for, or engaging with [child sexual exploitation] content across all forms of media.\u201d",
      "In May 2024, X said it helped Thorn test a tool to \u201cproactively detect text-based child sexual exploitation.\u201d The \u201cself-hosted solution was deployed seamlessly into our detection mechanisms, allowing us to hone in on high-risk accounts and expand child sexual exploitation text detection coverage, X said\u201d",
      "Pailes Halai, Thorn\u2019s senior manager of accounts and partnerships, who oversaw the X contract, said that some of Thorn\u2019s software was designed to address issues like those posed by the hashtag CSAM posts, but that it wasn\u2019t clear if they ever fully implemented it.",
      "\u201cThey took part in the beta with us last year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they helped us test and refine, etc, and essentially be an early adopter of the product. They then subsequently did move on to being a full customer of the product, but it\u2019s not very clear to us at this point how and if they used it.\u201d",
      "Without Thorn, it\u2019s not entirely clear what child safety mechanisms X is currently employing. \u201cOur technology is designed with safety in mind,\u201d Halai said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the platform to enforce and use the technology appropriately \u2026 What we do know on our side is it\u2019s designed to catch the very harms that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Halai said Thorn didn\u2019t take the termination of its contract with X lightly.",
      "\u201cIt was very much a last-resort decision for us to make,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided the services to them. We did it for as long as we possibly could, exhausted all possible avenues and had to terminate, ultimately, because, as a nonprofit, we\u2019re not exactly in the business of helping to sustain something for a company like X, where we\u2019re actually incurring huge costs.\u201d",
      "Currently, some hashtags, like #childporn, are blocked when using X\u2019s search function, but other hashtags are open to browse and are filled with posts advertising CSAM for sale. NBC News found posts appearing to peddle CSAM in 23 hashtags that are oftentimes used together in the posts. NBC News only identified two hashtags that were blocked by X. The hashtags that were available to be posted to and viewed during an NBC News\u2019 review of the platform ranged from references to incest and teenagers to slightly more coded terms, like combinations of words with the name of the defunct video chat platform Omegle, which shut down in 2023 after a child sex exploitation lawsuit. Some hashtags contained jumbled letters and only contained posts advertising CSAM, indicating that they were created with the exclusive purpose of housing the advertisements.",
      "Some usernames of accounts posting the ads were simply a jumble of words associated with CSAM content on the platform, mixing names of social media platforms with other keywords.",
      "Many of the users linked directly to Telegram channels in their posts or their account bios and included explicit references to CSAM. Some posts linked to Discord channels or solicited direct messages to secure Discord links.",
      "Telegram and Discord have distinct positions in the internet\u2019s child exploitation ecosystem, offering semiprivate and private venues for people looking to sell or buy child exploitation material. NBC News previously reported on 35 cases in which adults were prosecuted on charges of kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault that allegedly involved communications on Discord.",
      "A Discord representative said, \u201c\u201dDiscord has zero tolerance for child sexual abuse material, and we take immediate action when we become aware of it, including removing content, banning users, and reporting to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\u201d The company said in response to NBC News\u2019 outreach that it removed multiple servers \u201cfor policy violations unrelated to the sale of CSAM.\u201d",
      "A representative for Telegram said \u201cCSAM is explicitly forbidden by Telegram\u2019s terms of service and such content is removed whenever discovered.\u201d The representative pointed to the company\u2019s partnership with the U.K.-based Internet Watch Foundation, which maintains a database of known CSAM and provides tools to detect and remove it.",
      "While some of the X accounts posted publicly, others solicited and offered CSAM through X\u2019s Communities feature, where users create groups based on specific topics. NBC News observed groups with tens of thousands of members in which CSAM was solicited or was offered to be sold.",
      "In a group with over 70,000 members devoted to \u201cincest confessions,\u201d multiple users posted multiple times linking to Telegram channels, explicitly referencing CSAM. \u201cI\u2019m selling 6cp folder for only 90$,\u201d one user wrote, linking to a Telegram account. CP is a common online abbreviation for \u201cchild pornography.\u201d",
      "CSAM has been a perpetual problem on the internet and social media, with many companies employing specialized teams and building automated systems to identify and remove abuse content and those spreading it.",
      "But Musk also instituted drastic cuts to the company\u2019s trust and safety teams, and disbanded the company\u2019s Trust and Safety Council. In 2023, the company said that it was detecting more CSAM than in previous years and that it had increased staffing devoted to the issue despite larger trust and safety layoffs.",
      "Richardson, C3P\u2019s director of information technology, said that while X will sometimes remove accounts that are flagged to it for violating rules around CSAM, \u201ca new account pops up in two seconds, so there\u2019s not a lot of in depth remediation to the problem. That\u2019s just sort of the bare minimum that we\u2019re looking at here.\u201d",
      "He said an increasing reliance on artificial intelligence systems for moderation, if X is using them, could be in part to blame for such oversights. According to Richardson, AI systems are good at sorting through large datasets and flagging potential issues, but that, currently, systems will inevitably over- or under-moderate without human judgment at the end.",
      "\u201cThere should be an actual incident response when someone is selling child sexual abuse material on your service, right? We\u2019ve become completely desensitized to that. We\u2019re dealing with the sale of children being raped,\u201d Richardson said.  \u201cYou can\u2019t automate your way out of this problem.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a highly effective new HIV-prevention medication, Gilead Sciences reported Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved a highly effective new HIV-prevention medication, Gilead Sciences reported Wednesday. In clinical trials, the drug nearly eliminated HIV\u2019s spread among people given an injection every six months.",
      "Called Yeztugo, the highly effective drug has inspired feverish anticipation among advocates for HIV prevention. The hope is the medication could accelerate the stubbornly slow decline of HIV transmission in the United States.",
      "\u201cThis is the single best opportunity in 44 years of HIV prevention,\u201d said Mitchell Warren, executive director of the HIV advocacy nonprofit group AVAC.",
      "Yeztugo (generic name lenacapavir), which is given by health care workers in clinics, is significantly more effective than the existing oral HIV-prevention drugs, experts said, because it appears to address the challenges of sticking to a daily pill regimen for people who are at high risk of HIV.",
      "Gilead\u2019s chairman and CEO, Daniel O\u2019Day, suggested in a statement Wednesday that the drug could \u201cend the HIV epidemic once and for all.\u201d",
      "It was approved after astounding results in Gilead\u2019s large clinical trials of the drug. The trials randomly assigned people at risk of HIV to receive either lenacapavir injections every six months or daily Truvada, a pill form of pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. Among gay and bisexual men and transgender people, the Yeztugo group had an 89% lower HIV rate than a group taking Truvada and a 96% lower rate than Gilead estimated would have been expected absent any PrEP.",
      "In a similar trial among cisgender women in sub-Saharan Africa, no one who received Yeztugo contracted HIV.",
      "The shot is the first in a new class of antiretrovirals which block HIV from infecting and making new copies of itself inside the immune cells it targets. Lenacapavir was first approved in 2022, under the brand name Sunleca, for use with other medications to treat highly drug resistant strains of the virus.",
      "All forms of PrEP work in the same way: If enough of the drug is present in the body when a person is exposed to HIV,  it's highly effective at preventing the virus from taking hold and establishing a lifelong infection. Lenacapavir is so long-acting, it only needs to be injected twice a year.",
      "However, Yeztugo\u2019s use as PrEP against HIV emerges into a political climate that experts warn could derail progress against the virus\u2019 spread. The Trump administration\u2019s recent sweeping cancellations of research grants and its severe cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s staffing have dramatically affected the HIV-prevention field in particular. HIV experts are concerned that Yeztugo\u2019s full potential might remain unrealized.",
      "Priced at $14,109 per injection, or $2,352 per month, Yeztugo's cost could be another hurdle.",
      "Health insurers, at least in the near term, might decline to cover the shots in favor of other forms of PrEP, including the cheaper generic version of Truvada pills, which cost as little as $30 per month. Or insurers might impose higher copays for lenacapavir, said Elizabeth Kaplan, director of health care access at Harvard Law School\u2019s Health Law and Policy Clinic.",
      "A pending Supreme Court decision concerning a pillar of the Affordable Care Act could also be a barrier to insurance coverage for medications that prevent HIV. The ACA, or Obamacare, mandates no-cost coverage for certain preventive interventions like PrEP.",
      "A Gilead spokesperson said that within two days from Yeztugo\u2019s approval, people should be able to start asking health care providers for the drug. However, putting aside the question of whether insurance will cover the drug, it could take up to two months for people to actually receive their first injection.",
      "Mixed success for PrEP drugs",
      "Older forms of PrEP have had mixed success.",
      "Truvada, also made by Gilead, was the first approved PrEP drug in 2012, followed by a similar oral medication from the company, Descovy, in 2019.",
      "They have steadily gained popularity among gay and bisexual men, who, according to the CDC, account for 7 in 10 new HIV cases and comprise the overwhelming share of PrEP users.",
      "However, considering how much higher the HIV rate is among Black and Latino gay men compared with their white peers, PrEP use among men of color has remained disproportionately low. Experts believe PrEP has most likely hastened HIV\u2019s considerable decline among white gay and bisexual men, but the HIV rate among Black and Latino gay and bisexual men has persisted at markedly high rates. In addition, when they are prescribed PrEP, Black gay men are less likely to take the pill regimen as prescribed.",
      "When they are taken daily, Truvada and Descovy each slash HIV risk by at least 99%. But inconsistent use diminishes PrEP\u2019s effectiveness.",
      "In late 2021, ViiV Healthcare\u2019s Apretude was approved as an injectable PrEP given every two months.",
      "Despite being much more effective than Truvada at lowering HIV cases across a population of gay and bisexual men and transgender women in a major clinical trial, Apretude has gained scant traction until recently. About 21,000 people are taking it, ViiV reported. It\u2019s possible that, in part, people have been alienated by the requirement to visit a clinic every two months for Apretude, instead of every three months for an oral PrEP prescription.",
      "Yeztugo has the potential, but will it deliver?",
      "The twice-yearly injection offers an alternative for people who won\u2019t or have trouble remembering to take a pill every day, reducing the number of required annual clinic visits from four to two.",
      "According to CDC estimates, during the decade after PrEP\u2019s debut, the annual HIV transmission rate declined by only 17%, from 38,300 cases in 2012 to 31,800 cases in 2022. Much of the decline occurred since 2018, with case numbers falling by 12% during that four-year period.",
      "In 2019, the Trump administration launched the Ending the HIV Epidemic, or EHE, initiative, which has since targeted nearly $3 billion in new spending to combat HIV, including by promoting PrEP, in 48 hot-spot counties in particular. The target jurisdictions had a swifter 21% decline in estimated HIV transmissions from 2018 to 2022.",
      "In a study published in October, CDC investigators reported that PrEP use has risen steadily since 2014 and that about 200,000 people were receiving some form of it during any month of 2023.",
      "But that is only a small fraction of the 1.5 million gay and bisexual men who are good PrEP candidates, according to estimates in a new CDC study published in May.",
      "The crucial question is whether a critical mass of people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have stuck to an oral PrEP regimen can routinely be provided lenacapavir while they are at risk of HIV.",
      "Dr. Susanne Doblecki-Lewis, chief of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, is the site principal investigator for the lenacapavir clinical trial in gay men and a separate trial in people who inject drugs. She said lenacapavir could mitigate HIV-related racial disparities, provided it is made \u201cavailable easily and at low or no cost to people who can benefit from it who are uninsured or underinsured.\u201d",
      "But, she said, \u201cif there are barriers, like complicated prior authorizations or high copays that will prevent people from easily starting it, we could see disparities just get worse.\u201d",
      "Political challenges",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s 2026 budget request seeks a $1.5 billion, or 35%, cut for domestic HIV funding. That includes shuttering the CDC\u2019s $794 million HIV-prevention division, although some remnants of it are apparently meant to be folded into a new federal health department, along with a maintained $220 million in EHE funding.",
      "Much of the CDC\u2019s HIV-prevention and -surveillance budget is distributed in grants to state and local health departments and nonprofit organizations. Severe federal budget cuts would most likely hobble those entities\u2019 efforts to educate at-risk populations and doctors about lenacapavir and provide services to facilitate its use.",
      "Another hurdle for prescribers is whether they can ensure that people at risk of HIV return for lenacapavir shots twice yearly. Two recent studies, one published in May and another presented at a conference in March, found that fewer than half of oral PrEP users stay on it for six months or longer.",
      "Historically, the National Institutes of Health has funded research to help implement new forms of PrEP, examining weak spots and devising interventions. But the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to slash NIH spending has had a severe impact on HIV research, including PrEP, according to a dossier of canceled grants compiled by a Harvard researcher.",
      "A federal judge ruled Monday that some such NIH grant terminations were \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d and \u201cvoid and illegal.\u201d But the temporary win for researchers doesn\u2019t mean the NIH under Trump will necessarily become newly hospitable to grant proposals concerning PrEP implementation.",
      "Johanna Mercier, Gilead\u2019s chief commercial officer, said in an interview this month that the company has been pushing insurers to cover lenacapavir. She expressed optimism for ultimately widespread coverage of the drug.",
      "Gilead will cover up to $7,200 annually in out-of-pocket costs for insured people receiving Yeztugo. And its patient assistance program will provide it free to low-income uninsured people. There is otherwise a patchwork system nationally that can often aid the uninsured in covering the required clinic visits and lab tests.",
      "Tristan Schukraft, CEO of the popular PrEP-focused telehealth company Mistr, said it intends to begin offering the drug immediately through its storefronts in seven major urban gay neighborhoods. The company has also formed partnerships with a nationwide network of community-based clinics that can provide the shots, including to people without insurance.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d Schukraft said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s family business is taking preorders for a gold-colored smartphone, the T1.",
      "Trump Mobile, which launched Tuesday, says the device will be available in September, cost far less than Apple\u2019s and Samsung\u2019s smartphones \u2014 and be made in the United States, aligning with the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d economic ethos.",
      "Industry experts and tech journalists instantly cast doubt on those claims. And if Carlsbad, California-based smartphone maker Purism is any example, it would take much more than two months for Trump Mobile to build an American-made smartphone from scratch. It would also likely be more expensive than the T1\u2019s advertised price of $499.",
      "At $2,000, Purism's Liberty Phone is more expensive than an iPhone 16 Pro. It has half the iPhone\u2019s memory with roughly twice the thickness. You also can\u2019t download many apps on it. According to Todd Weaver, who founded Purism in 2014, it\u2019s the only U.S.-made smartphone on the market.",
      "But with \u201ckill switches\u201d to turn off its wi-fi, camera and microphone, the Liberty Phone is marketed as a secure option because it also carries its own operating system designed by Purism.",
      "It took a lot of time and effort to get to that point, Weaver told NBC News. Going from \u201cI would like to make a phone, and I would like to make it in the U.S.\u201d to actually achieving it took six years, he said.",
      "Purism\u2019s assembly line consists of just four people screwing together phones by hand \u2014 a far cry from the shoulder-to-shoulder line of people and automated machinery often associated with mass production facilities in China.",
      "The \u201cMade in the USA electronics\u201d sticker that Purism slaps on the product is a declaration of confidence \u2014 since the Federal Trade Commission regulates claims of that sort.",
      "Yet even Purism\u2019s built-in-America phone needs some foreign help. Ninety percent of the phone\u2019s materials come from the United States, Canada or Europe. Among the components made elsewhere: a chassis from China, camera modules from China or South Korea, and a bluetooth module from India. Purism publishes this information online.",
      "For materials like a specific crystal necessary for the motherboard to operate, Purism says there are no options for U.S. sourcing, meaning there\u2019s no choice but to buy from China.",
      "\u201cThere just isn\u2019t a company yet providing that single crystal,\u201d said Weaver.",
      "The Trump Organization didn\u2019t respond to NBC News\u2019 questions about how Trump Mobile's T1 phone would be made.",
      "Another issue looming over the market: Trump\u2019s ever-shifting trade policies. The president recently threatened a 25% tariff on all smartphone imports, taking aim at manufacturers like Apple and Samsung that make their phones abroad.",
      "\u201cAgain, when they build their plant here, there\u2019s no tariff, so they\u2019re going to be building plants here,\u201d the president said last month.",
      "The percentage of the materials for Purism\u2019s phone that come from overseas is small enough that tariffs from the Trump administration would not affect its $2,000 price. But the tariffs would affect a phone Purism does make in China, called the Librem 5. It\u2019s currently priced at $800 but new import duties would take it closer to the Liberty phone\u2019s $2,000 level.",
      "While tariffs are a \u201cgood incentive\u201d for manufacturing in the U.S., Weaver said, the on-again-off-again approach from the administration makes it tough to plan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cIf you have no idea, and you can\u2019t predict [the policy], it\u2019s very hard for any company, for any business owner. From t-shirts, textiles, to high tech, it is very hard to make a long term business decision when you\u2019re in a whipsaw.\u201d"

      "The U.S. assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program has not changed since March when the director of national intelligence told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush towards building an atomic bomb, according to the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee and a source with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Comments by President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have painted a different picture, suggesting that Iran is now racing toward creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that Iran was \u201ca few weeks\u201d from having a nuclear weapon and Netanyahu said in a recent interview that Iran was pursuing a \u201csecret plan\u201d to build a bomb within months.",
      "\u201cThe intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear, was absolutely clear that they were working on a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,\u201d Netanyahu recently told Fox News. \u201cThey were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.\u201d",
      "U.S. intelligence reporting on Israel is typically based in part on information provided by Israel\u2019s intelligence services. It was unclear if Netanyahu\u2019s remarks were based on a different interpretation of the same intelligence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters he was perplexed by Trump's assertions as lawmakers have received a different picture from U.S. intelligence officials.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies assessed that Iran had not made a decision to build nuclear weapons but it had stockpiles of enriched uranium far beyond what is required for civilian purposes. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s view has not changed since her testimony, the source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Warner said Wednesday that he received further confirmation of the March intelligence assessment \u201cthis week.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump publicly dismissed Gabbard\u2019s testimony, saying \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said.\u201d",
      "Warner said the administration needed to clarify if there was new intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "\u201cSo far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon. They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that (decision) was left with the supreme leader,\u201d Warner said.",
      "\u201cIf there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it\u2019s based upon fact and not political influence,\u201d the senator said.",
      "Building the bomb",
      "For Iran to acquire a nuclear arsenal, it would need to enrich uranium to 90 percent purity. At the moment, it has a significant amount of uranium enriched to 60 percent, about 400 kilograms\u2019 worth, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "It would take a small technical step to enrich to 90 percent. Iran has enough uranium now to produce up to 10 weapons over several weeks, according to U.S. officials\u2019 estimates.",
      "But enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels is only the first step. Then Iran would have to build and test a device that can be delivered in the form of a bomb or missile. Estimates vary, but Western officials and analysts say it could take months to more than a year to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "Weapons experts say Iran is not weeks away from securing a nuclear weapon, but it is weeks away from securing enough fissile material for an eventual weapon.",
      "The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said in a report earlier this month that \u201cIran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60 percent.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Grossi told CNN said that U.N. inspectors did not have proof Iran was engaged in \u201ca systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s air strikes on Iran have probably set back the country\u2019s nuclear program by a few months, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Since launching its campaign against Iran last week, Israel has bombed centrifuge plants used to enrich uranium, including a site at Natanz south of Tehran, and labs used to convert uranium gas into a metal, according to the IAEA and Israeli officials.",
      "Israel says it has killed several nuclear scientists and targeted missile launch and storage sites in its air raids."

They decide to push for better pay for the entire team and meet with franchise staff members before the season begins. But as the season begins, the conversation is tabled, and several of the dancers express their disappointment when their contract for the 2024-25 season includes no pay raise.",

      "\u201cI may do it. I may not do it,\u201d Trump told reporters outside the White House earlier today. \u201cNobody knows what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d",
      "The president openly admired the effectiveness of Israel\u2019s initial airstrikes against Iran, even though Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu clearly launched his strikes to interrupt Trump\u2019s nuclear diplomacy with Tehran.",
      "But after being rebuffed in April when he sought Trump\u2019s approval for a joint operation against Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Netanyahu could be on the verge of persuading an American president to provide the B-2s to deliver the 30,000-pound \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs capable of penetrating the concrete fortress believed to conceal Tehran\u2019s most dangerous stockpile of nearly-weapons-grade uranium, based on new Israeli intelligence. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on MSNBC today that conflicts with a briefing to Congress this week that the U.S. intelligence has not changed: Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "Israel\u2019s argument is that it\u2019s now or never. It has decapitated two of Iran\u2019s proxies \u2014 Hezbollah and Hamas \u2014 and toppled the Assad regime in Syria, and its retaliatory strikes last year eliminated many of Iran\u2019s air defenses. Israel\u2019s air force could damage Iran\u2019s above-ground nuclear sites and missile bases if it struck now, before Iran repairs its defenses, but can\u2019t eliminate the nuclear threat without U.S. bombs and bombers to reach the most critical underground facility.",
      "That has created a political tug-of-war for the heart and mind of Trump, who has publicly yearned for the Nobel Prize, seeing himself as a peacemaker who could bring Iran back into the community of non-terrorist nations and avoid another \u201cforever war.\u201d Fighting that vision is his competing impulse to join Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat once and for all. And Tehran\u2019s leaders clearly misjudged how patient Trump would be with their refusal to compromise in the negotiations.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin remains on the sidelines, preoccupied with his own war. Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II and French President Emmanuel Macron strongly oppose U.S. involvement. Trump has been consulting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Gulf\u2019s most influential leader.",
      "At home, the MAGA base is divided, with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., leading the hawks and a growing cohort of Republican isolationists \u2014 even in Trump\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 opposed. Most prominently, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard posted a highly produced anti-war video on her official X account, reportedly infuriating her boss.",
      "Critics worry about unintended consequences of military action, repeating former Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s rueful warning before the U.S. war in Iraq. It\u2019s like the Pottery Barn rule: If you break it, you own it.",

      "\u201cThis decision casts little if any light on how a majority of justices will analyze or rule on other issues,\u201d said Shannon Minter, a lawyer at the National Center for LGBTQ Rights.",
      "Most notably, the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, did not address the key issue of whether such laws should automatically be reviewed by courts with a more skeptical eye, an approach known as \u201cheightened scrutiny.\u201d Practically, that would mean laws about transgender people would have to clear a higher legal bar to be upheld.",
      "The justices skipped answering that question because the court found that Tennessee\u2019s law banning gender transition care for minors did not discriminate against transgender people at all.",
      "But other cases are likely to raise that issue more directly, meaning close attention will be paid to what the justices said in the various written opinions, as well as what they did not say.",

    "summary": "The Buss family, which has run the Lakers for 46 years, is selling a majority stake for a valuation of $10 billion.",
    "story": [
      "Control of one of the highest-profile and most valuable professional sports teams in the world is changing hands.",
      "The Buss family, which has run the Los Angeles Lakers for 46 years, is selling a majority stake in the iconic NBA franchise for a valuation of $10 billion to Mark Walter, who had owned a minority stake, multiple sources confirmed to NBC News.",
      "It would be the second glamorous Southern California franchise in which Walter, the chief executive of TWG Global, has a controlling interest; an ownership group he leads has owned the Los Angeles Dodgers since 2012.",
      "\"Mark Walter is entering into an agreement to acquire additional interests in the NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers, of which he has been a stakeholder since 2021,\" a spokesperson for Walter wrote by email.",
      "Should the NBA approve the sale, it would be the first time since 1979, when Jerry Buss bought the Lakers for $67.5 million, that the Buss family no longer controls the team that has won 17 NBA championships, second-most all time, including 11 under the family\u2019s ownership. Upon Jerry Buss' death in 2013, control of the team transferred to a family trust, and his children have run the team since then, led by daughter Jeanie Buss. The family held a 66% stake in the team.",
      "Buss plans to continue to act as the team's governor after sale, which would allow her to vote on league matters at board meetings of NBA owners, the league source said. According to NBA bylaws, Buss would need to retain at least 15% ownership to remain in such a role. An arrangement in which the person who owns a controlling stake of a team does not serve as its governor at league meetings is rare, but not unprecedented.",
      "The $10 billion valuation is all the more remarkable given the team does not own its own arena. Anschutz Entertainment Group owns and operates Crypto.com Arena.",
      "ESPN was first to report news of the sale.",
      "Last year, Forbes ranked the Lakers as the world\u2019s eighth most-valuable team, at $7.1 billion.",
      "Walter joined the Lakers ownership group in 2021, when Philip Anschutz sold a 27% stake of the team to him and a Dodgers co-owner, Todd Boehly.",
      "\"Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning \u2014 Mark Walter, my business partner and friend!\" Magic Johnson, the former Lakers superstar who is part of groups with Walter that own the Dodgers and the WNBA\u2019s Los Angeles Sparks, posted on X.",
      "Johnson added, \"Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand,\" and he added in a later post that \"Lakers fans should be ecstatic.\"",
      "The sale resets the bar for the value of a pro sports team. The proposed $6.1 billion sale of the NBA's Boston Celtics, which has yet to be formally completed, previously held the record for NBA franchises.",
      "In the past decade, as NBA teams changed hands to owners with fortunes in technology and finance, the Lakers remained one of the NBA's last family businesses, with a relatively modest-sized front office and support staff. Walter could inject spending power into the team in a repeat of how his Guggenheim Baseball Group has transformed the Dodgers from a team that filed for bankruptcy in 2011, a year before their sale, to a financial juggernaut and two-time World Series champion backed by an $8.3 billion media rights deal with Time Warner Cable."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Five days after President Donald Trump's inauguration, seven Senate Democrats voted to confirm Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Nearly five months later, most of them are critical of her, with some going as far as to say they regret their votes.",
      "\"I'm very disappointed. I'm very disappointed in her,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told NBC News this week. \"If I were voting on her today, I definitely wouldn't vote for her.\"",
      "Freshman Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., also said he would vote differently and oppose her nomination if he could do it again.",
      "\"She's weaponizing the Department of Homeland Security. She is taking so many actions right now that are making us less safe and going against a lot of the things that she said that she was going to focus on,\" Kim said Wednesday. \"So I have no confidence in her leadership right now.\"",
      "The five other Democrats who voted to confirm Noem were Sens. Elissa Slotkin and Gary Peters, both of Michigan; Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen, both of New Hampshire; and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. The vote on Jan. 25 was 59-34, with Republicans unanimously voting for Noem. Seven senators, six of whom caucus with the Democrats, missed the vote.",
      "At the time, several Democrats were struggling to find their way forward on the issue of immigration enforcement, which is largely run by DHS, following Trump's election victory.",
      "Now, the mood has changed in the wake of the administration's aggressive deportation agenda and moves to target green card holders and international students. On top of that, Democrats expressed outrage after Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., was forcibly removed from a DHS news conference last week when he tried to ask Noem a question.",
      "Slotkin said she voted for Noem because Michigan has \"major equities with the Department of Homeland Security\" as a border state that is \"about to open up a huge new bridge\" to Canada.",
      "But while Slotkin stopped short of saying she'd switch her vote, she was critical of Noem's performance.",
      "\"She has, frankly, not been in much control of policy. I see her more as a bystander, often, to policy \u2014 especially what's going on right now,\" Slotkin said. \"And you know, we've been urging our committee to take more accountability on her.\"",
      "Peters, the top Democrat on the Homeland Security Committee, which oversees DHS, said he's \"not surprised\" by Noem's actions and disagrees with many of them.",
      "Asked whether he stands by his vote to confirm her, Peters said, \"I'm the ranking member on the committee, and I have to have a working relationship with the secretary, regardless of the positions that they take.\"",
      "\"And so far we've, we've been able to have that,\" he said.",
      "Fetterman \u2014 who has broken with his party on some issues, including immigration \u2014 didn\u2019t comment when he was asked whether he stands by his vote for Noem or how he rates her performance.",
      "The two New Hampshire senators criticized Noem in statements provided by their offices without saying whether they stand by their votes.",
      "\u201cSenator Hassan has serious concerns about some of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s recent actions and continues to press for more answers and oversight \u2014 including into Senator Padilla\u2019s treatment last week,\u201d Hassan spokesperson Sahil Mehrotra said.",
      "And Shaheen spokesperson Brendan Duff said: \u201cSenator Shaheen has been disappointed by the Secretary\u2019s tenure heading the Department of Homeland Security and remains concerned by her leadership of the agency thus far, including her severe lack of transparency. She intends to continue demanding answers and holding the Department accountable.\u201d",
      "A DHS spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who voted against Noem, tore into her performance.",
      "\"It's really hard to imagine someone doing a worse job as the secretary of homeland security,\" Schiff said in an interview. \"The draconian, inconsistent, inflammatory immigration policies; the lawlessness; the rendering of people outside the country to maximum-security prisons; the arrest of U.S. citizens; the constant, bizarre spectacle of her doing dress-up outside of a maximum-security prison; or in her various cosplay. It's embarrassing, and it takes the focus off of what should be the heart of that job, and that is protecting our homeland security.\""

      "The bear first turned up on a trail camera as a cub in 2023 in the northern Lower Peninsula. After that, the Department of Natural Resources was on the lookout for the elusive animal with a hard plastic lid around the neck, Norton said.",
      "The bear appeared again on a camera in late May, still wearing the barrel lid, and the DNR responded by setting a cylindrical trap and safely luring him inside. The bear was anesthetized, and the lid was cut off on June 3. He eventually woke up and rambled away.",
      "Norton said it's not precisely known how the lid got stuck on the bear's neck. Bear baiting is legal in Michigan, but the hole on a barrel lid typically must be large enough to avoid what happened to this bear.",
      "It also isn't known how the 110-pound (49.9-kilogram) bear slept through winters wearing the uncomfortable accessory.",

      "The upshot for consumers: The cost to borrow money \u2014 whether  through credit cards, for auto loans or mortgages \u2014 won't be changing substantially anytime soon.",
      "The Federal Reserve sets the benchmark interest rate for all other borrowing rates in the U.S. economy. This is known as the federal funds rate.",
      "Right now, the federal funds rate target sits at between 4.25% and 4.5%. To be sure, the Fed does not directly control interest rates for consumer borrowing, but the federal funds rate serves as a type of baseline for the way banks set their own interest rates for customers seeking credit and loans.",
      "It's why the average credit card annual percentage rate (APR) has been stuck at about 25% for as long as the Fed has been holding its key rate at the current levels \u2014 about six months.",
      "So why has the Fed been keeping interest rates at this level for so long?",
      "The central bank is tasked by Congress with keeping both unemployment and the pace of price growth, or inflation, in check. To do so, it uses the federal funds rate to control demand for goods and services in the economy \u2014\u00a0much of which rely on borrowing.",
      "When the Fed fears businesses have been too aggressive in raising prices in response to strong demand, it raises the cost of borrowing to cool that demand down. It's what happened when the Fed hiked interest rates to the highest levels in more than a decade in 2023 in response to surging price growth as the economy roared back to life from the pandemic.",
      "Since then, inflation has cooled substantially. So much so, in fact, that President Donald Trump has begun to pester the Fed about cutting the federal funds rate.",
      "Yet the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation remains above its 2% target and, its policymakers say, risks moving higher because of Trump's tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that he expects the cost of most tariffs to ultimately be passed through to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "There are risks to keeping rates elevated, however. Reducing overall demand in the economy makes companies less inclined to hire workers. Already, there are signs that the labor market is weakening, though there remains debate about just how much at this moment.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re out of work, it\u2019s hard to find a job, but there are very few people who are being laid off at this point,\u201d Powell said Wednesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s an equilibrium we watch very, very carefully.\u201d",
      "But overall, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a pretty good labor market.\u201d",
      "For now, analysts say the Fed remains in wait-and-see mode.  Officially, the Fed estimates that it may cut the interest rate two times by the end of this year.",
      "Powell said he anticipates learning more about the impact from tariffs this summer. But he also said there is not a lot of \u201cconviction\u201d among Fed policymakers about where things could go.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has defied all kinds of forecasts for it to weaken,\u201d Powell said Wednesday, referring to the economy, adding that \u201ceventually it will \u2014 but we don\u2019t see signs of it now.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When Elon Musk took over Twitter in 2022, he said that addressing the problem of child sexual abuse material on the platform was his \u201ctop priority.\u201d Three years later, the problem appears to be escalating, as anonymous, seemingly automated X accounts flood hashtags with hundreds of posts per hour advertising the sale of the illegal material.",
      "At the same time, Thorn, a California-based nonprofit that works with tech companies to provide technology that can detect and address child sexual abuse content, told NBC News that it had terminated its contract with X.",
      "Thorn said that X stopped paying recent invoices for its work, though it declined to provide details about its deal with the company citing legal sensitivities. X said on Wednesday that it was moving toward using its own technology to address the spread of child abuse material.",
      "Some of Thorn\u2019s tools are designed to address the very issue that appears to be growing on the platform.",
      "\u201cWe recently terminated our contract with X due to nonpayment,\u201d Cassie Coccaro, head of communications at Thorn, told NBC News. \u201cAnd that was after months and months of outreach, flexibility, trying to make it work. And ultimately we had to stop the contract.\u201d",
      "Many aspects of the child exploitation ads issue, which NBC News first reported on in January 2023, remain the same on the platform. Sellers of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) continue to use hashtags based on sexual keywords to advertise to people looking to buy CSAM. Their posts direct prospective buyers to other platforms where users are asked for money in return for the child abuse material.",
      "Other aspects are new: Some accounts now appear to be automated (also known as bots), while others have taken advantage of \u201cCommunities,\u201d a relatively new feature launched in 2021 that encourages X users to congregate in groups \u201ccloser to the discussions they care about most.\u201d Using Communities, CSAM advertisers have been able to post into groups of tens of thousands of people devoted to topics like incest, seemingly without much scrutiny.",
      "The Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P), an independent online CSAM watchdog group, reviewed several X accounts and hashtags flagged by NBC News that were promoting the sale of CSAM, and followed links promoted by several of the accounts. The organization said that, within minutes, it was able to identify accounts that posted images of previously identified CSAM victims who were as young as 7. It also found apparent images of CSAM in thumbnail previews populated on X and in links to Telegram channels where CSAM videos were posted. One such channel showed a video of a boy estimated to be as young as 4 being sexually assaulted. NBC News did not view or have in its possession any of the abuse material.",
      "Lloyd Richardson, director of information technology at C3P, said the behavior being exhibited by the X users was \u201ca bit old hat\u201d at this point, and that X\u2019s response \u201chas been woefully insufficient.\u201d \u201cIt seems to be a little bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole that goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a particular push to really get to the root cause of the issue.\u201dX says it has a zero tolerance policy \u201ctowards any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for X directed NBC News to a post from its @Safety account detailing what the company says are new efforts to find and remove child abuse material.",
      "\u201cAt X, we have zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation in any form. Until recently, we leveraged partnerships that helped us along the way,\u201d the company said in the post. \u201cWe are proud to provide an important update on our continuous work detecting Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) content, announcing today that we have launched additional CSAM hash matching efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis system allows X to hash and match media content quickly and securely, keeping the platform safer without sacrificing user privacy,\u201d the post continued. \u201cThis is enabled by the incredible work of our safety engineering team, who have built state of the art systems to further strengthen our enforcement capabilities.\u201d",
      "The company said that the system would allow the company to automatically detect known CSAM and remove it, though it was not clear how it differs from existing hashing technology.",
      "The spokesperson did not respond to questions about Thorn's allegations regarding the payments.",
      "A review of many hashtags with terms known to be associated with CSAM shows that the problem is, if anything, worse than when Musk initially took over. What was previously a trickle of posts of fewer than a dozen per hour is now a torrent propelled by accounts that appear to be automated \u2014 some posting several times a minute.",
      "Despite the continued flood of posts and sporadic bans of individual accounts, the hashtags observed by NBC News over several weeks remained open and viewable as of Wednesday. And some of the hashtags that were identified in 2023 by NBC News as hosting the child exploitation advertisements are still being used for the same purpose today.",
      "Historically, Twitter and then X have attempted to block certain hashtags associated with child exploitation. When NBC News first reported on the use of X to market CSAM, X\u2019s head of trust and safety said the company knew it had work to do and would be making changes, including the development of automated systems to detect and block hashtags.",
      "In January 2024, X CEO Linda Yaccarino testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the company had strengthened its enforcement \u201cwith more tools and technology to prevent bad actors from distributing, searching for, or engaging with [child sexual exploitation] content across all forms of media.\u201d",
      "In May 2024, X said it helped Thorn test a tool to \u201cproactively detect text-based child sexual exploitation.\u201d The \u201cself-hosted solution was deployed seamlessly into our detection mechanisms, allowing us to hone in on high-risk accounts and expand child sexual exploitation text detection coverage, X said\u201d",
      "Pailes Halai, Thorn\u2019s senior manager of accounts and partnerships, who oversaw the X contract, said that some of Thorn\u2019s software was designed to address issues like those posed by the hashtag CSAM posts, but that it wasn\u2019t clear if they ever fully implemented it.",
      "\u201cThey took part in the beta with us last year,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they helped us test and refine, etc, and essentially be an early adopter of the product. They then subsequently did move on to being a full customer of the product, but it\u2019s not very clear to us at this point how and if they used it.\u201d",
      "Without Thorn, it\u2019s not entirely clear what child safety mechanisms X is currently employing. \u201cOur technology is designed with safety in mind,\u201d Halai said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the platform to enforce and use the technology appropriately \u2026 What we do know on our side is it\u2019s designed to catch the very harms that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Halai said Thorn didn\u2019t take the termination of its contract with X lightly.",
      "\u201cIt was very much a last-resort decision for us to make,\u201d he said. \u201cWe provided the services to them. We did it for as long as we possibly could, exhausted all possible avenues and had to terminate, ultimately, because, as a nonprofit, we\u2019re not exactly in the business of helping to sustain something for a company like X, where we\u2019re actually incurring huge costs.\u201d",
      "Currently, some hashtags, like #childporn, are blocked when using X\u2019s search function, but other hashtags are open to browse and are filled with posts advertising CSAM for sale. NBC News found posts appearing to peddle CSAM in 23 hashtags that are oftentimes used together in the posts. NBC News only identified two hashtags that were blocked by X. The hashtags that were available to be posted to and viewed during an NBC News\u2019 review of the platform ranged from references to incest and teenagers to slightly more coded terms, like combinations of words with the name of the defunct video chat platform Omegle, which shut down in 2023 after a child sex exploitation lawsuit. Some hashtags contained jumbled letters and only contained posts advertising CSAM, indicating that they were created with the exclusive purpose of housing the advertisements.",
      "Some usernames of accounts posting the ads were simply a jumble of words associated with CSAM content on the platform, mixing names of social media platforms with other keywords.",
      "Many of the users linked directly to Telegram channels in their posts or their account bios and included explicit references to CSAM. Some posts linked to Discord channels or solicited direct messages to secure Discord links.",
      "Telegram and Discord have distinct positions in the internet\u2019s child exploitation ecosystem, offering semiprivate and private venues for people looking to sell or buy child exploitation material. NBC News previously reported on 35 cases in which adults were prosecuted on charges of kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault that allegedly involved communications on Discord.",
      "A Discord representative said, \u201c\u201dDiscord has zero tolerance for child sexual abuse material, and we take immediate action when we become aware of it, including removing content, banning users, and reporting to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).\u201d The company said in response to NBC News\u2019 outreach that it removed multiple servers \u201cfor policy violations unrelated to the sale of CSAM.\u201d",
      "A representative for Telegram said \u201cCSAM is explicitly forbidden by Telegram\u2019s terms of service and such content is removed whenever discovered.\u201d The representative pointed to the company\u2019s partnership with the U.K.-based Internet Watch Foundation, which maintains a database of known CSAM and provides tools to detect and remove it.",
      "While some of the X accounts posted publicly, others solicited and offered CSAM through X\u2019s Communities feature, where users create groups based on specific topics. NBC News observed groups with tens of thousands of members in which CSAM was solicited or was offered to be sold.",
      "In a group with over 70,000 members devoted to \u201cincest confessions,\u201d multiple users posted multiple times linking to Telegram channels, explicitly referencing CSAM. \u201cI\u2019m selling 6cp folder for only 90$,\u201d one user wrote, linking to a Telegram account. CP is a common online abbreviation for \u201cchild pornography.\u201d",
      "CSAM has been a perpetual problem on the internet and social media, with many companies employing specialized teams and building automated systems to identify and remove abuse content and those spreading it.",
      "But Musk also instituted drastic cuts to the company\u2019s trust and safety teams, and disbanded the company\u2019s Trust and Safety Council. In 2023, the company said that it was detecting more CSAM than in previous years and that it had increased staffing devoted to the issue despite larger trust and safety layoffs.",
      "Richardson, C3P\u2019s director of information technology, said that while X will sometimes remove accounts that are flagged to it for violating rules around CSAM, \u201ca new account pops up in two seconds, so there\u2019s not a lot of in depth remediation to the problem. That\u2019s just sort of the bare minimum that we\u2019re looking at here.\u201d",
      "He said an increasing reliance on artificial intelligence systems for moderation, if X is using them, could be in part to blame for such oversights. According to Richardson, AI systems are good at sorting through large datasets and flagging potential issues, but that, currently, systems will inevitably over- or under-moderate without human judgment at the end.",
      "\u201cThere should be an actual incident response when someone is selling child sexual abuse material on your service, right? We\u2019ve become completely desensitized to that. We\u2019re dealing with the sale of children being raped,\u201d Richardson said.  \u201cYou can\u2019t automate your way out of this problem.\u201d"

      "Republicans\u2019 \u201cbig beautiful\u201d bill, if enacted as drafted, would make some of the biggest changes to the federal student loan system in decades.",
      "GOP House and Senate lawmakers\u2019 proposals would eliminate several repayment plans, keep borrowers in debt longer and roll back relief options for those who become unemployed or run into another financial challenge.",
      "The House advanced its version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in May. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions released its budget bill recommendations related to student loans on June 10. Senate lawmakers are preparing to debate the massive tax and spending package.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, said his party\u2019s plans would lift the burden on taxpayers of subsidizing college graduates\u2019 loan payments.",
      "\u2033[Former President Joe] Biden and Democrats unfairly attempted to shift student debt onto taxpayers that chose not to go to college,\u201d Cassidy said in a statement on June 10. He said his committee\u2019s bill would save an estimated $300 billion out of the federal budget.",
      "However, consumer advocates say that the legislation will deepen a lending crisis in which millions of borrowers are already struggling to pay off the debt from their education.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about fiscal responsibility, it\u2019s about doing some funny math that justifies tax cuts,\u201d said Astra Taylor, co-founder of the Debt Collective, a union for debtors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely hard for people to get out of debt with these changes,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "Here are three big proposals in the GOP bills to overhaul federal student lending.",
      "1. Fewer repayment plans, larger bills",
      "Under the Republican proposals, there would be just two repayment plan choices for new borrowers, compared with roughly a dozen options now.",
      "Student loan borrowers could either enroll in a standard repayment plan with fixed payments, or an income-based repayment plan known as the \u201cRepayment Assistance Plan,\u201d or RAP.",
      "Under RAP, monthly payments would typically range from 1% to 10% of a borrower\u2019s income; the more they earn, the bigger their required payment. There would be a minimum monthly payment of $10 for all borrowers.",
      "A typical student loan borrower with a college degree could pay an extra $2,929 per year if the Senate GOP proposal of RAP is enacted, compared with the Biden administration\u2019s now-blocked SAVE plan, according to a recent analysis by the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "The new plan would fail to provide many borrowers with an affordable monthly bill \u2014 the goal of Congress when it established income-driven repayment plans in the 1990s, said Michele Zampini, senior director of college affordability at The Institute for College Access & Success.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans\u2019 proposed \u2018Repayment Assistance Plan\u2019 is the only thing standing between borrowers and default, we can expect many to suffer the nightmarish experience of default,\u201d Zampini said.",
      "2. Longer timelines to loan forgiveness",
      "As of now, borrowers who enroll in the standard repayment plan typically get their debt divided into 120 fixed payments, over 10 years. But the Republicans\u2019 new standard plan would provide borrowers fixed payments over a period of between 10 years and 25 years, depending on how much they owe.",
      "For example, those with a balance exceeding $50,000 would be in repayment for 15 years; if you owe over $100,000, your fixed payments will last for 25 years.",
      "Meanwhile, current income-driven repayment plans now conclude in loan forgiveness after 20 years or 25 years. But RAP wouldn\u2019t lead to debt erasure until 30 years.",
      "\u201cThirty years is your adult life,\u201d Taylor said.",
      "If RAP becomes law, she said, \u201cWe anticipate an explosion of senior debtors.\u201d",
      "3. Fewer ways to pause bills",
      "House and Senate Republicans are also calling for the elimination of the economic hardship and unemployment deferments.",
      "Those deferments allow federal student loan borrowers to pause their monthly bills during periods of joblessness or other financial setbacks, often without interest accruing on their debt. Under both options, which have existed for decades, borrowers can avoid payments for up to three years.",
      "Under the Senate Republicans\u2019 proposal, student loans received on or after July 1, 2026, would no longer qualify for the unemployment deferment or economic hardship deferment. The House plan does away with both deferments a year earlier, on July 1, 2025.",
      "\u201cThese protections enable borrowers to stay in good standing on their loans while they get back on their feet,\u201d Zampini said.",
      "\u201cWithout them, borrowers who suddenly can\u2019t afford their payments will have little recourse, and many will likely enter delinquency and eventually default,\u201d she said.",

      "In the last three episodes of \u201cWe Were Liars,\u201d Prime Video\u2019s new psychological-thriller series, the long-running mystery finally unravels, and Cadence Sinclair Eastman learns the truth about what really happened on Beechwood Island during the summer of her accident.",
      "As her memory returns, so does the unbearable reality: Her three closest friends \u2014 Mirren, Johnny and Gat \u2014 died in a fire that they started together.",
      "\u201cIt was a complete shock,\u201d actor Shubham Maheshwari, who plays Gat, told TODAY.com. \u201cIn all the directions the story could have gone, it just completely made me a fool.\u201d",
      "Though the series is adapted from E. Lockhart\u2019s bestselling young-adult book published in 2014, Maheshwari and his co-star Emily Alyn Lind, who plays Cadence, read the novel while auditioning.",
      "\u201cWhile I was reading the book, I didn\u2019t see it coming at all,\u201d Maheshwari said. \u201cI think, or at least I hope, that the show kind of does that, too.\u201d",

      "In the penultimate episode, the timeline from two summers ago shows Cadence and the Liars around a fire, sifting through her grandfather\u2019s will and the ways he\u2019ll be distributing his wealth when he\u2019s gone. Cadence then ponders a world where the \u201cpetty, material\u201d things tearing the Sinclair family apart were just \u2026 gone. Cut to present-day Cadence, as the rest of the memory becomes clear to her.",
      "\u201cThere was a fire,\u201d she tells Mirren and Johnny. \u201cWe burned this place to the ground.\u201d",
      "The finale shows viewers what happened: Cadence, in a drunken stupor with the rest of the Liars, suggests they gas up every part of the house with fuel from the boathouse, light a match and get out of there. So they do just that \u2014 but the fire moves quicker than the Liars. Mirren and Johnny are trapped, Gat goes in to save them, and only Cadence escapes. Just when she realizes none of them made it out, the house\u2019s gas line explodes, sending Cadence cascading into the ocean.",
      "And all that time in the present day when Cadence was conversing with Gat and her cousins \u2014 it was in her head. She\u2019s no longer simply a privileged teenager on a summer getaway; she\u2019s a girl haunted by guilt.",
      "Series creators Julie Plec and Carina Adly MacKenzie said they leaned into both the mystery and emotional fallout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d Plec told TODAY.com. \u201cCadence has this jarring event, this terrible thing that happened to her. \u2026 It makes her unable to understand her truth.\u201d",
      "And, despite their privilege, the Liars\u2019 choices are messy and real.",
      "\u201cYou start with characters that the audience is going to want to reject and hate just for existing,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cAnd then you have to give the audience a reason to stick around and to pull back the layers on their pain and their trauma.\u201d",
      "At the series\u2019 end, Cadence chooses to leave her family behind.",
      "\u201cLoyalty means doing one last thing to mourn \u2014 and also pay respect to her friends that are gone,\u201d Lind told TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s the least that (Cadence) can do after everything that they have had to endure.\u201d",

      "Warning: This story has spoilers for E. Lockhart\u2019s book \u201cWe Were Liars.\u201d",
      "Imagine if you couldn\u2019t remember your family\u2019s biggest secret. In E. Lockhart\u2019s young adult novel \u201cWe Were Liars,\u201d protagonist Cadence is faced with this exact reality.",
      "More than 10 years after the psychological thriller was published in 2014, \u201cWe Were Liars\u201d is making its way to the small screen as a limited series, dropping June 18 on Prime Video.",
      "Though the series will mirror the book in many ways, Lockhart tells TODAY.com that the series has some changes.",
      "\u201cThe TV show has to open up the book. There are deeper stories for Cadence\u2019s friends, for her love interest and also for the moms,\u201d Lockhart tells TODAY.com.",
      "Lockhart says showrunners Julie Plec and Carina Adly Mackenzie hold onto \u201cthe feeling of the novel\u201d while also broadening it by creating two timelines. The series flips between a \u201cmagical summer where Cadence and Gat fall in love and she\u2019s in a place of innocence,\u201d according to Lockhart, and then her reality after she has a terrible accident.",
      "\u201cThat later timeline, everything is from Cadence\u2019s perspective. You can only see what she can see. But back in the memory section, it\u2019s a broader scope,\u201d Lockhart says.",
      "That\u2019s how the book compares to the show \u2014 but if you\u2019re after book spoilers, keep reading for a refresher on all the heart-wrenching moments from the novel before diving into the show.",
      "What is \u2018We Were Liars\u2019 About?",
      "The Sinclairs are what one might call rich rich. And every summer, three generations of Sinclairs come together on Beechwood Island, a fictional private island off the coast of Massachusetts.",
      "There\u2019s Grandad, who\u2019s widowed; his three daughters, Penny, Carrie and Bess, who are all separated from their husbands; and the seven kids between them. One of those children is Cadence.",
      "Cadence, along with Mirren and Johnny, her two older cousins, and Gat, the son of her aunt\u2019s boyfriend, make up what the family calls the Liars.",
      "In the beginning of the novel, we find out that Cadence and Gat fell in love when she was 14, despite Grandad\u2019s dislike of Gat and Gat\u2019s father due to their South Asian heritage.",
      "But the following summer, there was a tragic accident of some sort. While Cadence can\u2019t remember what happened that summer, she has migraines to show for what must have been a terrible ordeal that left her with a severe head injury.",
      "The summer after her accident, Cadence\u2019s father decides to take her on a trip to Europe, where she writes to the Liars repeatedly, but receives no reply. Frustrated with her inability to remember what happened two summers ago and even more frustrated with her cousins for ignoring her emails, Cadence insists on spending \u201csummer 17\u201d on the island. Reluctantly, her parents agree to let her spend the first month of summer on Beechwood Island with the rest of her family, but it\u2019s clear that a lot has changed since she\u2019s last been on the compound.",
      "For one, the old Victorian house where Grandad and Granny used to live has been entirely rebuilt. Additionally, her first interactions with her aunts and cousins are awkward.",
      "The only thing that is seemingly normal about this summer is that her relationships with the Liars feel like no time has passed. And the bunch agree that this summer, they\u2019ll distance themselves from the rest of the family and just stick together. Over the course of her time on the island, Cadence\u2019s begins to remember what happened two summers ago \u2014 and it\u2019s more horrible than anyone could have imagined.",
      "What Happens at the End of 'We Were Liars'?",
      "As memories come back to Cadence in bits and pieces, no one is willing to help her stitch together the full picture. Whenever she asks anyone about what happened on the island two years ago, including the Liars, she gets nothing but empty half answers.",
      "But suddenly, it all starts coming back.",
      "The same summer as the accident, Cadence recalls Grandad and his three daughters arguing about the family home in Boston. Also, one of her aunts was very unhappy about the condition of her home on the island.",
      "Toward the end of the novel, the memories begin to rush in for Cadence. There had been an ugly family spat over Grandad\u2019s inheritance, with his three daughters all vying for the best portion. With tensions high, Grandad and the aunts all leave the island to cool off, and the Liars decide to take matters into their own hands,",
      "Fed up with their parents\u2019 and Grandad\u2019s fighting, the Liars, while intoxicated, set fire to the home thinking that if no one could inherit it, then they\u2019d ease the family\u2019s financial tensions.",
      "But something went terribly wrong \u2014 and Cadence was partially responsible. As the other Liars poured gasoline all over the house, Cadence threw a lit match on the floor while they were still inside. The entire ground floor of the home caught fire before the other three Liars and the two family dogs could escape, making Cadence the lone survivor of the accident.",
      "Finally, Cadence remembers in her own time what occurred two summers ago. Back then, her doctors advised her parents to let her remember the incident on her own, because when anyone reminded her of it, she would spiral into emotional turmoil, which no doubt contributed to her migraines.",
      "As for her interactions with the Liars all summer? Cadence had been seeing them as ghosts because her subconscious wasn\u2019t yet ready to let them go.",
      "In the end, at one of the homes on the island, affectionately named Cuddletown, Cadence says her final goodbye to the Liars, whose spirits she finally lays to rest."

    "summary": "Pope Leo XIV is related to seven celebrities, including Madonna, Justin Bieber and Angelina Jolie, says \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d host Henry Louis Gates Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV may be one of the most powerful people in the world, so it only makes sense he is related to some pretty powerful people, too.",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d host Henry Louis Gates Jr. said the pontiff, who was elected to the position in May, is related to several prominent celebrities and politicians, which he revealed in a piece he wrote for The New York Times Magazine.",
      "Gates teamed up with genealogists at American Ancestors and the Cuban Genealogy Club of Miami to go back 15 generations while identifying more than 100 people related to the pope, a native Chicagoan born Robert Prevost. The study managed to trace his mother\u2019s side as far back as 1500s Spain.",
      "Leo, the 267th pope and first born in America, had eighth-great-grandparents born in France, who moved to Quebec in the middle of the 17th century.",
      "\u201cThrough one Canadian ancestor, Louis Boucher de Grandpre, who was born in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, the pope is related to numerous Canadian-derived distant cousins, including (former Canadian prime ministers) Pierre and Justin Trudeau, Angelina Jolie, Hillary Clinton, Justin Bieber, Jack Kerouac and Madonna,\u201d Gates wrote in NYT Magazine.",
      "It is not made specifically clear how Leo is related to each person.",
      "The pope\u2019s personal history is fascinating and not without controversy.",
      "Gates said that Leo\u2019s grandfather, Salvatore Giovanni Gaetano Riggitano Alito, was one of many descendants born in Sicily and that he probably immigrated to the United Staes in 1905.",
      "\u201cSalvatore was on his way to becoming a priest but was unable to take his vows and chose to marry instead,\u201d Gates writes.",
      "Salvatore had a mistress named Suzanne Louise Marie Fontaine from France, who came to the United States about a decade after he did.",
      "\u201cTheir extramarital affair produced two sons out of wedlock, Jean, the pope\u2019s uncle, and Louis, the pope\u2019s father. They were given their grandmother\u2019s maiden name, Pr\u00e9vost,\u201d Gates wrote.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how the pope ended up with a French surname \u2014 minus the accent \u2014 even though his paternal grandfather\u2019s ancestors were almost all Italian.\u201d",
      "The pope also had family that settled in New Orleans, with at least four white ancestors owning slaves. Leo also has African American ancestors who were either slaves or slaveholders themselves."

      "What caused the cheerleader to take a break from the group and did she ever return? We\u2019re unraveling one of Season 2\u2019s biggest mysteries, and what she\u2019s since said.",
      "Who is Chandi Dayle?",
      "Chandi Dayle, a sixth-year veteran of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) gets a lot of screen time during Season 2 of the Netflix docuseries as she tries out for and earns her spot on the 2024-2025 squad.",
      "Per her DCC bio, Dayle has multiple jobs outside of cheerleading, working as a social media marketing specialist for a pediatric dentistry practice and a licensed pharmacy technician for her family\u2019s business. She also works at a Pilates studio and performs contract work for a DCC sponsor.",
      "What does Chandi's love life have to do with anything?",
      "In Episode 6, Dayle opened up about a prior abusive relationship, explaining that her ex-boyfriend misused alcohol and became emotionally and physically abusive on multiple occasions.",
      "Dayle described her ex as a \u201cstalker\u201d in the period after their breakup and said he threatened her new boyfriend.",
      "Despite her efforts to file domestic violence, harassment and stalking police reports, Dayle said she had been unsuccessful in her attempts to obtain any form of meaningful protection from her ex.",
      "The cheerleader said that her fear had taken a toll on the quality of her current relationship. Later on, Dayle announced that she and her boyfriend had broken up.",
      "Why did Chandi take a leave of absence?",
      "Episode 6 depicts the squad's trip to the Bahamas for a team retreat. By the time they returned, Dayle had taken a leave of absence.",
      "According to Trammell and Finglass, Dayle took time off to address her \u201cmental health.\u201d During Dayle's absence, KayDianna MacKenzie stepped in as first leader.",
      "Speculation, meanwhile, ricocheted around the team.",
      "\u201cWe all know something\u2019s going on and we\u2019re not getting any answers. No one\u2019s speaking about it as a whole so everything is just being whispered,\u201d DCC squad member Jada Mclean said.",
      "Dayle then appeared and addressed what happened in a confessional interview.",
      "The cheerleader said she\u2019d been \u201cstruggling mentally\u201d and has \u201cdone bad things to myself before.\u201d",
      "What happened in the Bahamas?",
      "Mclean ultimately summarized what happened in the Bahamas: Dayle brought \u201csomebody\u201d into her room, upsetting some teammates. Other cheerleaders brought up that by doing so, Dayle broke a contractual policy.",
      "\u201cA lot of people were worried for their safety because they didn\u2019t know who this individual was. If that was me, I probably wouldn\u2019t want to be in a room with a stranger either,\u201d she continued.",
      "Still, Mclean was sensitive to what Dayle was feeling in the moment.",
      "\u201cTo other people, it came off as, \u2018Oh my gosh, you put me in danger.\u2019 Or, \u2018You weren\u2019t worried about my safety.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think she thought of that in an almost just na\u00efve way. She wasn\u2019t thinking about that at all. She was kind of thinking about what she needed at the time,\u201d she said.",
      "What did Chandi say about the incident?",
      "Dayle recalled breaking up with her boyfriend and spiraling emotionally afterwards.",
      "\u201cWhen we took the trip to the Bahamas, I met someone and we shared similar things that have happened in our past. I was just like kind of crumbling down and I was like, \u2018Dang, I feel like I have no one here to talk to and so it\u2019s nice to have someone to confide in,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Dayle admitted to breaking DCC protocol but says she was only thinking about needing a friend to listen to her, clarifying that it wasn\u2019t a hookup situation.",
      "\u201cIt helped me in the moment. Like I get it, it was probably the wrong place and time to do that. But selfishly, I had to do it for me because I feel like I was just losing it,\u201d she said to her friend.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to have all that pressure on you all the time. I don\u2019t really know who I am. DCC\u2019s not even happy for me anymore cause I don\u2019t know myself. And I feel like I\u2019ve just reached that point where I feel like I\u2019m making mistakes in my own life. And they expect you to wake up and be perfect every day. But I can\u2019t do it anymore. I really just wanted to dance and be happy and I just haven\u2019t been,\u201d she said.",
      "What happened when Chandi returned to the DCC squad?",
      "Just in time for the end of the season, Dayle returned to the squad \u2014 but not as a team leader. She was met with mixed reactions.",
      "\u201cIt affected some people more than others, but the way that those people didn\u2019t feel like they were being heard then affected the group more because a lot of people have kind of walked away from her. And that\u2019s not something you want, especially on a team this big,\u201d Mclean said in a confessional interview.",
      "While opening up about her return to the team, Dayle said it was \u201creally nice\u201d not being a first leader anymore.",
      "\u201cNow I don\u2019t have to think about what I\u2019m doing or what I\u2019m calling or anything like that,\u201d she said.",
      "Mclean offered support for her teammate in an interview, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve all done things that we shouldn\u2019t have done or been in situations that we shouldn\u2019t have been in. There\u2019s no time to sit and dwell in the past. We can sit here in this or we can move forward.\u201d",
      "Finglass applauded Dayle for doing \u201ca great job for the situation she\u2019s in\u201d and acknowledged that it was \u201cvery hard\u201d for her to watch the cheerleader \u201cgo through a low point.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel very motherly to her. She needs hugs and she needs love and she needs forgiveness. We\u2019re not gonna leave any of our children out in the cold,\u201d she said.",
      "Is Chandi still with the DCC?",
      "Dayle has opted to move on from the squad.",
      "\u201cI think this year I found who I really am. I lost it for sure, was lost in who I really was, There was a long time where I was scared to just not be without dance because that was just me and that was my safe space. But I feel good,\u201d she said while talking with her coaches about her decision.",
      "Finglass said it would be a \u201chuge transition\u201d without Dayle on the squad but wished her well.",
      "Wait, what happened to KayDianna?",
      "Remember when KayDianna MacKenzie stepped in for Chandi during her leave of absence? The season finale revealed she\u2019s no longer a member of the team.",
      "Finglass called the decision MacKenzie\u2019s \u201cchoice\u201d and said it resulted from \u201cone conversation of honest feedback.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, MacKenzie shared her own version of the story in a confessional interview.",
      "\u201cBahamas happened. I stepped into leadership. I definitely didn\u2019t feel supported. I felt like I was just a body. It was as if Chandi got the perks of being a first leader and I got the responsibility part of it,\u201d she said.",
      "The cheerleader went on to say she and her teammates were \u201cconfused\u201d and didn\u2019t know \u201cwhat was going to happen\u201d next.",
      "Then, one day, MacKenzie\u2019s was on TikTok Live and some of her followers started asking about the Bahamas incident. Although she didn\u2019t name Dayle directly, MacKenzie did say she\u2019d record a video one day to explain what happened.",
      "\u201cOf course someone screen-recorded it and put it on Reddit. They blew it up. I didn\u2019t even talk about Chandi, never said Chandi\u2019s name. And then I got a call from staff. They said that I was under investigation for being a bully and harassing and I was officially suspended at that point,\u201d she said.",
      "At that point, MacKenzie\u2019s decided to step away from the organization and \u201crespect\u201d herself. Still, she said having to miss the squad banquet was a letdown.",
      "\u201cEven though it was a tough year, I still wanted to be there for my rookies. I still wanted to celebrate this year,\u201d she said."

      "After decades in the entertainment industry, Sarah Jessica Parker knows how to brush off haters and online trolls, but she didn't always have an easy time navigating criticism, especially about her physical appearance.",
      "During the June 18 episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, the actor opened up about \"cruel\" comments she faced in the early days of her career while starring on \"Sex and the City.\"",
      "Parker began by acknowledging that she \"wasn't prepared\" for the level of scrutiny she would receive while starring on the hit series, which premiered in 1998, and called it \"a real test of my coping mechanisms.\"",
      "\"There was no chatter about me (before this time). There was just my work,\" she said.",
      "Host Alex Cooper then asked Parker which comments bothered her the most.",
      "\"I think just discussions of my physical person,\" Parker said, gesturing at herself. \"Like stuff that I couldn\u2019t change, and wouldn\u2019t change, and had never considered changing, or even still after hearing something that was like, 'What? Somebody would say that?' (I) even still (had) no interest in changing it.\"",
      "The 60-year-old went on to say it particularly bothered her that these comments were either made behind her back or in news publications.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it was actually a conversation. I didn\u2019t feel like I could sit in a room, and someone would say to me, \u2018You\u2019re really unattractive.\u2019 And then I could say, 'Wow, um, well first of all, that\u2019s hard to hear. But second of all, why do you seem angry about it?' Or, 'Why do you feel it\u2019s necessary to say it?'\" she said.",

      "In 2023, Apple TV+ released the first season of the romantic historical fiction drama, based on the Edith Wharton novel of the same name. The series follows Nan St. George (Kristine Froseth) and her gregarious group of friends as they leave behind the new money of New York City and venture into the stiff London society across the pond.",
      "Season 1 ended with Nan marrying Theo, the Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), even after it was revealed that she is illegitimate and born from one of her father's affairs.",
      "In the finale's last scene, Colonel St. George, Nan's father, told his wife and the woman who raised Nan, Patti (Christina Hendricks), that Nan's birth mother was at the wedding.",
      "The Season 2 premiere, which hit the streaming platform June 18, picked up right where things left off, with Hendricks' character storming through the crowd before she encounters Nan's birth mother: a woman named Nell, played by Meester.",
      "\"Nice hat,\" Nell tells Patti as they are reunited for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "Over the course of the Season 2 premiere, viewers learn that not only is Nell Nan's birth mother, she's also Patti's younger sister.",
      "It is revealed that after Patti had older daughter Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse), Nell moved in with the St. Georges. While living with the family, Nell had an affair with Colonel St. George, resulting in a pregnancy. After Nan's birth, Nell absconded, and she didn't lay eyes on her daughter again until her wedding day.",
      "When Nan interrupts the two sisters, Patti simply introduces her sibling as \"Aunt Nell,\" keeping her identity as Nan's mother a secret.",
      "Meester tells TODAY.com in an interview that one of the questions she had to grapple with was why her character would choose to attend the wedding.",
      "\"(Nell) probably, in my mind, stayed away as much as possible, but always had her ear pricked to what was going on in Nan\u2019s life, even before she was going to marry a duke,\" she says.",
      "So why now?",
      "\"I think that once it came out that Nan was illegitimate \u2014 the word that they were using \u2014\u00a0a little valve was released of the shame and the pain of all those years, of holding it in and thinking that it was the absolute worst thing, this mark on her, her family and Nan. And that it could potentially threaten Nan's future,\" Meester explains.",
      "But as the events of Season 1 showed, Nan's secret being exposed didn't have the impact she feared.",
      "Nan's heritage was revealed behind her back, but she later publicly owned it. Theo also stood up for her, strengthening their relationship in the lead up to their eventual marriage.",
      "\"(Nan) was able to freely open up about this information. I think that it freed Nell to some extent to go,\" Meester says.",
      "In the premiere, Nell's arrival certainly makes for a dramatic entrance, the \"Gossip Girl\" actor adds. But for Meester, her character's goal was simple.",
      "\"She knew where (Nan) was going to be at one moment, one place in time. I think she maybe didn't think, 'I will go tell Nan.' But (she went) at least to have some kind of contact, because to be away for so long from your own family is devastating,\" Meester says.",
      "As for what her character has been up to for the past 19 years, Meester says she was \"focused on forging ahead.\"",
      "\"I also think that she did, in my mind, spend many years punishing herself. And, I would put this in quotes, but 'behaving badly,'\" Meester adds. \"Because I think that's what she thought she deserved and what was expected of her.\"",
      "\"So she wasn't living a, quote, unquote good life,\" she continues. \"I think she was probably treating herself and others poorly during those years because she felt she was not good enough.\"",
      "Episode 1 ends with Nell offering Nan advice as her daughter suffers immediate regret for marrying Theo due to her lingering feelings for Guy (Matthew Broome). Then after a heart-to-heart with Patti, where Nell reminds her older sister that she was younger than Nan is now when she got pregnant, the sisters return to New York together.",
      "To Meester, Nell represents someone who survived the pain of not only giving up her child, but also the turmoil of living with that choice and keeping it a secret.",
      "\"I think you get the chance now to say that was the correct choice and the braver choice,\" Meester says. \"And that still remains today, when people have to make a decision like that. It is almost always the more sound choice if they've thought it out, which usually people have.\"",
      "Meester meticulously crafting her character's backstory is one of the many reasons co-stars Kristine Froseth and Christina Hendricks praised her addition to the cast.",
      "\"We love her,\" Hendricks tells TODAY.com. \"I was really, really excited about the casting when I found out about it. I had never met her before, but I was a fan, and so (I) didn't know what to expect.\"",
      "Hendricks notes that Meester was also tasked with joining a large ensemble cast that had already developed chemistry.",
      "\"It's always strange to come in as a newcomer when a show is already established and on its way, but she just fit right in,\" she says.",
      "\"(Meester) came in with lots of great ideas and great questions and just seamlessly fit in immediately,\" she adds.",
      "Froseth reveals it was \"nerve-wracking\" after Meester's casting was announced and she learned she would portray her birth mother. The 29-year-old actor is a huge \"Gossip Girl\" fan, but Froseth's nerves quickly settled once she met Meester.",
      "\"She's so down to earth, and so down to talk about character, and immediately wanted to do that,\" Froseth recalls. \"We didn't have much time beforehand to prep, but right away we started texting.\"",
      "She says they created a group chat so they could all be on the same page by the time filming began. For Froseth, the communication established a \"support system\" she could lean on.",
      "\"I'm really glad we had each other, because those dynamics are so nuanced and things move so fast in the show. I think it was important for me, at least, to get to talk to you guys about how you were feeling,\" she says, while gesturing to Hendricks.",
      "The \"Mad Men\" alum agrees, adding that with only eight episodes, there isn't as much time to explain the history between their characters. So, the three of them worked together to ensure audiences could sense the strained and complicated relationship.",
      "\"'What would have happened the last time they (saw) each other? What has transpired in that amount of time? Who lived where?' were some of the questions they discussed,\" Hendricks shares. \"Just technical things that the audience may not see right away, but will definitely enrich the performance and (were) important for us to have the relationships we wanted.\""

      "\"I want the door to stay open behind me, and it's only because of trans actresses and drag performers on Broadway before me ... these people paved the way for me to be here. And I want to do the same for others,\" she said, citing Angelica Ross, Laverne Cox and Peppermint.",
      "Monsoon described \"Oh, Mary!\" as \"one of the best, funniest, most energizing things\" she's ever seen in a statement.",
      "\u201cTo be invited to live in this playground for a time is not only an honor and a privilege, but a lovely chance to showcase the writing talents of one friend, the directorial talents of another, and everything else that comes with this singular production,\u201d Monsoon said.",
      "Monsoon will portray the title role for eight weeks, starting on Aug. 4 and ending on Sept. 27, after starring in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical\" through its final performance on July 27.",
      "When asked on TODAY how she will balance finishing one role while preparing for another, Monsoon joked, \"I\u2019m a witch, baby! I find ways.\"",
      "\"When you love the work that you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s easy to work really, really hard,\" she said.",
      "\"I fought so hard to get here that I don\u2019t like to take any moment for granted,\" she added.",
      "Monsoon said it's \"really nice to be a queer icon who's queer, knowing that young queer people get to look up to me.\"",
      "\"I was looking up to Bette Midler,\" she said.",
      "Monsoon is the only competitor to have won \"RuPaul's Drag Race\" twice and has become a breakout star in theater through her roles in \"Chicago\" and \"Little Shop of Horrors.\"",
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" is a dark comedy written by Cole Escola, who also originally starred as Mary Todd Lincoln, and imagines what life was really like for the wife of former President Abraham Lincoln in the weeks leading up to his assassination.",
      "\u201cNow \u2014 I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Cole Escola is the funniest person alive,\u201d Monsoon said in a statement.",
      "Escola won the Tony Award for best performance by an actor in a leading role in a play earlier this month, and the play's director, Sam Pinkleton, also won the Tony for best direction of a play.",
      "Escola is set to play their final performance as Mary Todd Lincoln on June 21, and Tituss Burgess will return to the role for an encore performance from June 23 to Aug. 2. Burgess previously played Mary Todd Lincoln from March 18 to April 6, following Betty Gilpin's portrayal.",
      "Original cast members Conrad Ricamora, James Scully, Bianca Leigh and Tony Macht will stay with the show through Aug. 2.",
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" opened on Broadway on July 11, 2024, at the Lyceum Theatre, where it became the first show in the theater\u2019s 121-year history to gross more than $1 million in a single week. It has since broken its own box-office record 12 times.",
      "The play has also been extended again, with tickets on sale for performances through Jan. 4, 2026."

The next thing she knows, she wakes up on the beach and her father is gone. She has no memory of what happened. This book began as a haunting story in The New Yorker and the writer turned it into a novel, which is every bit as haunting and compelling and the perfect read for a long flight this summer!\"",
      "Searles names this as his top travel pick.",
      "Originally published as a New Yorker story, Susan Choi developed this haunting tale into what Searles notes as one of the most compelling books of the summer.",

      "\u201cRecorded on a 4-track recorder in Springsteen\u2019s New Jersey bedroom, the album marked a pivotal time in his life and is considered one of his most enduring works\u2014a raw, haunted acoustic record populated by lost souls searching for a reason to believe.\u201d",
      "The trailer, which released on June 18, begins with Springsteen mulling over whether to buy a new car, while the salesman says he recognizes him. To his comment, Springsteen responds, \"Well that makes one of us,\" which sets the tone for the gritty trailer.",
      "The moment then shifts to the singer in a room recording a song with a guitar in hand while an engineer helps him.",
      "\u201cIt don\u2019t need to be perfect,\u201d he says to the engineer. \u201cI want it to feel like I\u2019m in the room by myself.\u201d",
      "In another scene, Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau (Jeremy Strong), appears to be in an office at a music label where he speaks to another about the singer's career.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about either one of us. This isn\u2019t about the charts. This is about Bruce Springsteen,\u201d Landau says before a shot zooms in on the singer playing the harmonica and his guitar. \u201cAnd these are the songs that he wants to work on right now.\u201d",
      "Later in the trailer, there are also shots of Springsteen on the beach and looking through old photos, as well as what appears to be a black and white flashback of him as a child boxing in his bedroom with his dad, while a voiceover explains how he had a hole in his bedroom while growing up.",
      "\u201cBruce is a repairman and what he is doing with this album is he\u2019s repairing that hole in his floor,\u201d the voiceover says over various images of Springsteen. \u201cHe\u2019s repairing that hole in himself. And once he\u2019s done that, he\u2019s going to repair the entire world.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to find something in all them worries,\u201d Springsteen says, as the trailer rises to a crescendo with quick cuts of him, including in the studio and one of him onstage singing his hit \u201cBorn to Run,\u201d as the clip comes to an end.",
      "White has previously said he would try to sing in the film, while Springsteen himself has given the seal of approval to \u201cThe Bear\u201d star portraying him.",
      "Directed by Scott Cooper, \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d based on the book \"Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" also stars Jeremy Strong, Paul Walter Hauser, Stephen Graham, Odessa Young, Gaby Hoffman, Marc Maron and David Krumholtz. The film is set to hit theaters on Oct. 24."

      "Who are Jeremiah and Huda?",
      "Jeremiah and Huda become a couple in Episode 1, when the initial group of women get to choose their partners after a game that involves a bit of kissing. Their connection is immediate. When former Islander Yulissa tries to kiss Jeremiah during the game, he deflects and opts for a kiss on the cheek instead \u2014 signaling quite early he has eyes for just Huda. By Episode 3, they are laughing about being the \u201cmom and dad\u201d of the villa.",
      "Huda actually is a mother, to a 4-year-old daughter. She chooses not to share this with the Islanders until she establishes trust with them. When she confides in Jeremiah at the end of Episode 3, he is shocked but says it doesn\u2019t change his feelings for her and promises not to tell.",
      "As re-couplings and new bombshells have come and gone, Huda and Jeremiah have stuck together, even through disagreements and doubts by other Islanders.",
      "That is, until Episode 12 ...",
      "What Happened in 'Love Island USA' Episode 12?",
      "Cracks begin to show in Huda and Jeremiah\u2019s relationship during the June 15 episode. During a group challenge hosted by \u201cSummer House\u201d star Paige DeSorbo, Jeremiah kisses fellow Islander Olandria, which clearly bothers Huda.",
      "\u201cI was not expecting Jeremiah and Olandria to, like, actually kiss,\u201d Huda says in her confessional. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see that going on.\u201d",
      "When she confronts Jeremiah about it, he doubles down on his actions and responds coolly, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d",
      "The situation escalates when other Islanders begin side-eyeing Huda\u2019s reaction to the kiss. Nic asks Jeremiah if Huda\u2019s protective behavior is \u201cover the top,\u201d wondering if that level of reaction would be an issue for him in a \u201creal relationship.\u201d",
      "Jeremiah shrugs off the comments, responding simply, \u201cI mean I can\u2019t control what she do.\u201d",
      "But the real shock comes when host Ariana Madix sweeps through the villa to lead a re-coupling. In a \u201cLove Island USA\u201d first, America had voted on pairings for the new bombshells \u2014 Pepe, Iris and Jalen \u2014 and those left single would be at risk. In the most surprising twist, viewers choose to pair Jeremiah with Iris, effectively separating him from Huda.",
      "The re-coupling leaves Huda single and vulnerable. When the remaining coupled Islanders have to vote someone out of the villa, Huda receives two votes \u2014 from Nic and Ace, two of Jeremiah\u2019s close pals \u2014 but was ultimately saved when another Islander, Charlie, is eliminated instead.",
      "What Happened in Episode 13?",
      "The fallout from Episode 12 \u2014 from America choosing to separate Huda and Jeremiah, from Nic and Ace voting to eliminate Huda, and from Jeremiah\u2019s massive shrug at all of it \u2014 was immediate and explosive in Episode 13. Jeremiah doesn\u2019t speak to Huda for the rest of the evening after the re-coupling, later saying he was \u201cchecked out.\u201d",
      "Nic and Ace get in front of Jeremiah, though. Their conversation escalates quickly, with Nic suggesting Huda had been marking Jeremiah with hickeys so other women wouldn\u2019t engage.",
      "\u201cBoth of you are just closed off, it\u2019s been tunnel vision since day one,\u201d Nic says.",
      "Jeremiah defends their connection, saying, \u201cWe instantly liked each other and then we explored that further.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Ace replies. \u201cYou act like you\u2019re all about one person from day one. That\u2019s scamming. ... How are you so sure about someone 30 seconds in?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Huda is spinning about the viewers\u2019 choice to separate her and Jeremiah. Does America not like her, or is America seeing something about Jeremiah that she isn\u2019t? She appears to believe the latter: She rages to the girls that Jeremiah didn\u2019t check on her after the re-coupling and rages some more about it from the shower, which Jeremiah overhears.",
      "If those seeds of doubt weren\u2019t planted by the guys before, that shower moment might\u2019ve done it for Jeremiah. When Jeremiah and Iris are sent on a date, along with the other re-coupled Islanders, he says he is open to new connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to hit the reset button with you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAmerica put us together for one reason or another.\u201d",
      "When the couples return from their dates, Huda refuses to greet the returning Islanders, instead sitting alone by the pool being \u201cunbothered,\u201d as she puts it. Jeremiah clocks it, muttering, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d",
      "The breaking point comes when Huda overhears Jeremiah debriefing the rest of the boys on his date with Iris. \u201cHuda\u2019s cooked, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Jeremiah says. He reveals that he\u2019d heard Huda in the shower the night before calling him a \u201cb----\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d",
      "\u201cTruthfully now in hindsight, I would have rather Huda have gone home, just because of the way she reacted,\u201d Jeremiah tells the guys.",
      "Huda emerges from behind a wall where she\u2019d been eavesdropping and confronts Jeremiah directly: \u201cBy all means, explore,\u201d she says, flipping him off.",
      "The episode ends with a private conversation, where Jeremiah apologizes to Huda for not being there when she was almost eliminated, but Huda isn\u2019t having it.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the reason why everything happened. You\u2019re the reason why I reacted the way I reacted,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI don\u2019t want s--- to do with you.\u201d",
      "What Happened in Episode 14?",
      "The June 17 episode picks up where Episode 13 ends, during that conversation with Huda and Jeremiah. Huda tells him that the Islanders and the viewers believe he has done \u201csubtle things\u201d that have shown his true colors, but Jeremiah replies that she has it flipped.",
      "\u201cWe have such different vibes and expectations, it seems,\u201d Jeremiah says in a confessional.",
      "Nevertheless, Jeremiah tries to make amends with Huda the next morning. During a private chat, he tells her that he\u2019d like to start over as friends. Huda\u2019s not interested in that, though. She storms away, yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d",
      "The rest of the Islanders are watching all of this from various parts of the villa, and, as Nic says, they\u2019re drained.",
      "Fast forward to the end of the episode, when Ariana Madix shows up once again for a surprise re-coupling. This time, it involves a game where each of the women stand behind a locked door. Only the guy they want to couple with can open that door, though. Any guy who\u2019s met with a locked door and any girl who remains behind a door is left single and vulnerable.",
      "Jeremiah is the last guy to choose a door \u2014 and it\u2019s between Iris\u2019s and Huda\u2019s. He chooses Iris.",
      "That move now leaves Huda vulnerable once again, along with one other Islander, Jalen. And because \u201cLove Island\u201d never stops there, the rest of the Islanders are then tasked with voting one of the two singles out of the villa.",
      "While Huda ends up safe, receiving eight backers versus Jalen\u2019s four, the vote gave viewers a clear view of the Islanders\u2019 thoughts on this saga. Jeremiah is among the four who vote to keep Jalen and dump Huda. And another shocker? Ace backs Huda instead of Jalen \u2014 but maybe not for reasons Huda thought. When Huda reaches her hand out to thank Ace, he leans away. \u201cHell, no,\u201d he whispers.",
      "So the saga continues."

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:43:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Barbara Walters' relationship with her daughter, Jacqueline Guber, is highlighted in a new documentary \"Barbara Walters Tell Me Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Walters was best known for her career as a pioneering journalist who spent many years with TODAY and ABC News. But much less well known is the tumultuous story of her private life, particularly with her lone child, Jacqueline, whom she adopted in 1968.",
      "In the new ABC News Studios documentary \u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything,\u201d which features archival footage of Walters, who died in 2022, she calls her daughter \u201ca blessing\u201d that came about after three miscarriages. She adds that having a daughter was \u201cthe best thing\u201d she ever did.",
      "But others took a different cue from the challenges Walters and Jackie faced over the years, especially when paired with a demanding, international career.",
      "\u201cShe had a charged, complex relationship with her daughter,\u201d says Oprah Winfrey in the doc, adding that witnessing how parenthood played out for Walters partially influenced her decision not to have children at all.",
      "In recent years, Jacqueline Guber, now in her late 50s, has kept her private life private, but there\u2019s much to know about her younger years and her relationship with her mother.",
      "Jacqueline was named for Barbara\u2019s sister",
      "Walters adopted Jacqueline with her second husband, theater producer Lee Guber. When Jacqueline was born, the couple kept her adoption a secret, making no press announcement, NBC News reported in 2002.",
      "\u201cIn part because I really didn\u2019t want the biological mother to know that Jackie had been adopted by us,\u201d Walters said. \u201cI just kept right on working.\u201d",
      "The adoption specifics were a bit unique, though. Walters told Winfrey in a 2014 interview, \u201cWe had dinner one night with a couple we rarely saw. The woman said that she had a little girl who was blonde and blue-eyed, and they wanted to adopt a boy. ... They didn\u2019t want the girl. And we said, \u2018We\u2019ll take the girl!\u2019\u201d",
      "She told Winfrey she named her after her older sister.",
      "In the documentary, Walters reflects on some of the challenges her sister faced.",
      "\u201cToday, they would talk about it as a disability,\u201d she says, \u201cand it may even be that my sister was autistic and we didn't know it.\u201d",
      "Walters also elaborated on the name significance in her 2014 retirement special, \u201cBarbara Walters: Her Story,\u201d according to People.",
      "\u201cI knew that my sister was never going to be married and have a child, and I wanted her to have part of the joy that I had.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline helped her mother accept \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019",
      "At the height of her fame, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Gilda Radner did an impression of Walters on the show known as \u201cBaba Wawa,\u201d honing in on how the journalist pronounced her \u201cr\u201d letters.",
      "Walters didn\u2019t like being made fun of until her daughter told her to \u201clighten up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hated the Gilda Radner \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019 until I walked into my daughter\u2019s room one night,\u201d Walters said during a 2009 interview with the Television Academy Foundation. \u201cShe was up watching it ... I said, \u2018What are you doing up?\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019m watching Baba Wawa.\u2019\u201d",
      "When Walters explained she didn\u2019t like the impression, Jacqueline said, \u201cLighten up.\u201d And in the interview, Walters said, \u201cI did.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline was a runaway as a teenager",
      "After her divorce in the 1970s, it was virtually impossible for Walters as an ambitious single woman to also be a full-time mother. As former TODAY co-anchor Katie Couric says in the new documentary, being a working mother was seen as \u201can oxymoron\u201d back then.",
      "Jacqueline was not left alone, journalist Cynthia McFadden, who was adopted herself, notes in the film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to say Jackie had a father, and Jackie had a governess,\u201d McFadden says.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how tough it was because she had a mother who was a celebrity,\u201d says Walters of her daughter in the doc.",
      "Walters explains Jacqueline struggled with schools and began taking pills. At 16, she ran away.",
      "\u201cI loved to run,\u201d Jacqueline told NBC in 2002. \u201cI thought running would solve all my problems.\u201d",
      "When Walters learned where her daughter was, she had a former Green Beret pick her up and sent her to an intervention program in Idaho for three years.",
      "\u201cEven though she, you know, probably kicked and screamed, she knew that things were getting so desperate, she had to go,\u201d Walters said in 2002. \u201cBut to send a child away is heartbreaking \u2026 I just knew that for this child, who was struggling enough to be her own person and not be Barbara Walter\u2019s daughter, to have this be headlines. I could have lived with it, OK. You know? But it would have been terrible for her.\u201d",
      "The program saved her life, Jacqueline said in 2002.",
      "She ran a wilderness camp for troubled teens",
      "After getting her diploma and completing the program, Jacqueline\u2019s father, Lee Guber, died. She was just 18, and moved to Oregon to find some anonymity, according to NBC News.",
      "She later moved to Maine where she met a licensed wilderness guide named Mark Danforth, and the two married.",
      "In 2001, she started a wilderness camp for troubled teens, New Horizons for Young Women, which was open from 1999 to 2008. The camp closed during the recession after financial challenges, as she outlined in a letter at the time.",
      "Jacqueline remains private today",
      "These days, Jacqueline is living a life out of the headlines and spotlights. But in 2001, at Walters\u2019 request, McFadden sat down to interview Jacqueline for a special about adoption called \u201cBorn in My Heart: A Love Story.\u201d",
      "As clips in the new documentary show, when McFadden asks what is tougher on Jacqueline, being adopted or being the child of a famous parent, the answer comes easily: being the child of a famous parent.",
      "\u201cHands-down,\u201d says Jacqueline.",
      "\u201cI could be the bum down there on the street corner\u2019s child. \u2026 And here I am, today, made up, dressed up and it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s almost like I was pasted into this world. And yet ... I am so regular,\u201d she adds.",
      "She also apologizes for making her mother\u2019s life hard when she was younger.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said, 'I\u2019m sorry,' for so many things. \u2026 I was sorry for my whole teenage years,\u201d she says.",
      "As Couric notes late in the documentary, it seems that Walters\u2019 relationship with her daughter ultimately came in second place to her career.",
      "\u201cI felt like she neglected her personal life and poured so much into her work life, that I\u2019m not sure she was a truly happy person,\u201d Couric says.",
      "\u201cI always got the sense that Barbara wishes she had paid more attention to that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything\u201d begins streaming June 23 on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+."

But the fact that these cars can brake, can stop and make a complete right turn. It feels like the car is going to flip, and it sticks. It is unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable what these drivers can do.\u201d",

      "The House of Commons approved an amendment to a broader crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished under an antiquated law.",
      "Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour member of Parliament who introduced one of the amendments, said the change was needed because police have investigated more than 100 women for suspected illegal abortions over the past five years, including some who suffered natural miscarriages and stillbirths.",
      "\u201cThis piece of legislation will only take women out of the criminal justice system because they are vulnerable and they need our help,\u201d she said. \u201cJust what public interest is this serving? This is not justice, it is cruelty and it has got to end.\u201d",
      "The amendment passed 379-137. The House of Commons will now need to pass the crime bill, which is expected, before it goes to the House of Lords, where it can be delayed but not blocked.",
      "Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions in England, Scotland and Wales up to 24 weeks, and beyond that under special circumstances, such as when the life of the mother is in danger. Abortion in Northern Ireland was decriminalized in 2019.",
      "Changes in the law implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic allow women to receive abortion pills through the mail and terminate their own pregnancies at home within the first 10 weeks.",
      "That has led to a handful of widely publicized cases in which women were prosecuted for illegally obtaining abortion pills and using them to end their own pregnancies after 24 weeks or more.",

      "\u201cUnborn babies will have any remaining protection stripped away, and women will be left at the mercy of abusers,\u201d said Alithea Williams, public policy manager for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes itself as the U.K.\u2019s biggest pro-life campaign group.",

      "The rapidly escalating conflict, triggered by Israel\u2019s surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on June 13, has sent oil prices surging and put a region on edge. Initially encouraging of diplomatic talks with Tehran, Trump\u2019s statements have become increasingly threatening as populations across the Middle East brace for what comes next.",
      "But destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 which Tehran asserts is for civilian energy purposes only \u2014 is no easy feat.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced and hardened nuclear facility, the Fordo plant in the country\u2019s northwest, is a fortress.",
      "Built inside a mountain some 300 feet underground and reinforced by layers of concrete, the plant \u2014 which is the most likely target of a potential American strike \u2014 is impenetrable by any bomb except the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The U.S. is the only country in the world that has this \u201cbunker buster\u201d weapon, as well as the only country with the aircraft capable of transporting and deploying it: the B2 Spirit stealth bomber.",
      "This is in part why Israel has been so eager for U.S. involvement in its offensive operations against Iran in addition to its defensive ones.",
      "But a strike in itself would not be a one-and-done job, military experts say.",
      "\u201cSo you have two challenges. You would have to drop two of these penetrators at the exact same site\u201d and likely need multiple bombing rounds, according to David Des Roches, a professor and senior military fellow at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cAnd then you would never be precisely sure how much of the facility you\u2019ve damaged,\u201d he added, meaning personnel may need to be deployed on the ground.",
      "\u201cThis leads me to believe that for those facilities, Israel will ultimately gain control of the air and then land forces on the ground, force their way into the facility by detonating the doors, and then go and place explosive charges, exfiltrate whatever intelligence they can get, and just detonate it from the inside,\u201d Des Roches told CNBC.",
      "Wider war for America?",
      "Iran\u2019s military capabilities have been severely degraded over the past few days by Israeli attacks, which have taken out substantial parts of its air defenses, ballistic missile batteries, command-and-control nodes and dozens of top commanders.",
      "Still, such a strike by the U.S. could trigger Iran to respond by striking at U.S. assets in the region like embassies and military bases. Trump has made clear that any attack on U.S. personnel would draw a fierce American response, which would then pull the world\u2019s most powerful military more deeply into a regional conflict.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have signaled that they are ready to attack U.S. bases in the region in the event of a U.S. attack on their domestic soil,\u201d said Gregory Brew, senior analyst on Iran and energy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noting that American bases in Iraq are particularly vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThere are risks in that environment that an Iranian retaliation causes U.S. casualties, kills U.S. servicemen, and potentially compels President Trump to expand the scope of U.S. action and order additional strikes on Iran and that, of course, would threaten general escalation and drag us into not just a single operation, but potentially a protracted air campaign.\u201d",
      "Despite its enormous scale, the GPU-57 bunker buster would not create wide-scale damage beyond the area of the facility, Des Roches said. But it would have a \u201cprofound psychological effect on the Iranians,\u201d he added, who have already seen significant damage and radioactive contamination risk wrought to the infrastructure of several of their nuclear sites in other parts of the country.",
      "A further critical question remains whether the Trump administration will limit itself to targeting nuclear sites, or whether it will expand operations beyond that \u2014 something Israel\u2019s government has also been urging, as it conveys its desire to see regime change for its longtime adversary.",
      "\u201cI think the conflict will end when Israel is confident that Iran has lost, for a significant period of time, the ability to make a nuclear weapon, and that its defenses are weakened enough that Israel will be able to go back and effectively disrupt any further effort by Iran to make a nuclear weapon,\u201d Des Roches argued.",
      "If Fordo remains operational, Israel\u2019s attacks would barely slow Iran\u2019s ability to build a bomb, nuclear analysts say. The decisions from the While House in the coming days will therefore prove decisive not only for the trajectory of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but for the survivability of the Islamic Republic\u2019s regime as a whole.",
      "Ali Vaez, Iran project director at nonprofit Crisis Group, believes that \u201cIran can survive and rebuild its nuclear program,\u201d even without a diplomatic avenue for a deal with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. entering the war will close the door on diplomacy,\u201d Vaez told CNBC. \u201cTrump might be able to destroy Fordow, but he won\u2019t be able to bomb away the knowledge that Iran has already acquired.\u201d"

      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "The U.S. assessment of Iran\u2019s nuclear program has not changed since March when the director of national intelligence told lawmakers that Tehran has large amounts of enriched uranium but has not made a decision to rush towards building an atomic bomb, according to the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee and a source with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Comments by President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have painted a different picture, suggesting that Iran is now racing toward creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that Iran was \u201ca few weeks\u201d from having a nuclear weapon and Netanyahu said in a recent interview that Iran was pursuing a \u201csecret plan\u201d to build a bomb within months.",
      "\u201cThe intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear, was absolutely clear that they were working on a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,\u201d Netanyahu recently told Fox News. \u201cThey were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.\u201d",
      "U.S. intelligence reporting on Israel is typically based in part on information provided by Israel\u2019s intelligence services. It was unclear if Netanyahu\u2019s remarks were based on a different interpretation of the same intelligence.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters he was perplexed by Trump's assertions as lawmakers have received a different picture from U.S. intelligence officials.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies assessed that Iran had not made a decision to build nuclear weapons but it had stockpiles of enriched uranium far beyond what is required for civilian purposes. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s view has not changed since her testimony, the source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Warner said Wednesday that he received further confirmation of the March intelligence assessment \u201cthis week.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, President Trump publicly dismissed Gabbard\u2019s testimony, saying \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said.\u201d",
      "Warner said the administration needed to clarify if there was new intelligence on Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "\u201cSo far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon. They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that (decision) was left with the supreme leader,\u201d Warner said.",
      "\u201cIf there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it\u2019s based upon fact and not political influence,\u201d the senator said.",
      "Building the bomb",
      "For Iran to acquire a nuclear arsenal, it would need to enrich uranium to 90 percent purity. At the moment, it has a significant amount of uranium enriched to 60 percent, about 400 kilograms\u2019 worth, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "It would take a small technical step to enrich to 90 percent. Iran has enough uranium now to produce up to 10 weapons over several weeks, according to U.S. officials\u2019 estimates.",
      "But enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels is only the first step. Then Iran would have to build and test a device that can be delivered in the form of a bomb or missile. Estimates vary, but Western officials and analysts say it could take months to more than a year to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "Weapons experts say Iran is not weeks away from securing a nuclear weapon, but it is weeks away from securing enough fissile material for an eventual weapon.",
      "The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said in a report earlier this month that \u201cIran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60 percent.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Grossi told CNN said that U.N. inspectors did not have proof Iran was engaged in \u201ca systematic effort to move into a nuclear weapon.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s air strikes on Iran have probably set back the country\u2019s nuclear program by a few months, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Since launching its campaign against Iran last week, Israel has bombed centrifuge plants used to enrich uranium, including a site at Natanz south of Tehran, and labs used to convert uranium gas into a metal, according to the IAEA and Israeli officials.",
      "Israel says it has killed several nuclear scientists and targeted missile launch and storage sites in its air raids."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is considering a range of options to resolve the worsening conflict in the Middle East, including a possible U.S. military strike against Iran, current and former administration officials said in a fresh sign of rising global tensions on his watch.",
      "Trump cut short his appearance at an international summit meeting in Canada to return to the White House at dawn Tuesday and focus on the conflict that has broken out between Israel and Iran. In leaving the summit early, he dropped a planned meeting with Ukraine\u2019s leader about the grinding war with Russia, which Trump once pledged to end on his first day in office.",

      "The death toll continues to rise in Gaza as his efforts to mediate a peace deal between Israel and Hamas falter. Though Trump prides himself on a respectful rapport with Vladimir Putin, Russia launched a drone and missile attack on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday that killed 15 people and targeted a residential apartment block.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign that he'd be a \"peacemaker.\" Now he is sounding a more bellicose note as he contemplates just how far to go in helping Israel neutralize the threat from Iran.",
      "\"We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding,\" Trump wrote Tuesday afternoon on Truth Social. \"He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.\"",
      "Trump met with senior officials in the White House Situation Room for about an hour and a half to discuss the war. Throughout the day, he posted further messages on his social media site, in which he aligned himself with Israel as it mounts an aerial attack aimed at wiping out Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Israel\u2019s assault followed Trump\u2019s effort to reach a diplomatic solution in which Iran would forgo efforts to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "\u201cWe now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social, choosing a pronoun that signifies his solidarity with Israel.",
      "\u201cUnconditional surrender!\u201d he wrote in capital letters, without specifying what that would mean, whether it's regime change in Iran or a deal in which Iran relinquishes its nuclear program.",
      "None of the options that Trump is weighing is easy. Only the United States possesses the large \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs that can reach Iran\u2019s underground Fordow uranium enrichment site. If Trump were to withhold them from Israel and leave Fordow intact, Iran would still be positioned to build a nuclear arsenal, and he might appear weak. Trump has repeatedly insisted he won\u2019t allow Iran to acquire a nuclear bomb.",
      "Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel\u2019s prime minister, made a case for Trump to intervene militarily in an interview with ABC News.",
      "\u201cToday, it\u2019s Tel Aviv. Tomorrow, it\u2019s New York,\u201d Netanyahu said.",
      "\u201cLook, I understand \u2018America First,\u2019\u201d he added, invoking Trump\u2019s foreign policy mantra. \u201cI don\u2019t understand \u2018America Dead.\u2019\u201d",
      "If Trump joins in the push to wipe out the Iranian nuclear program, it could alienate parts of the MAGA movement that object to U.S. involvement in far-flung international disputes.",
      "Trump campaigned for a second term promising to be a \u201cpeacemaker,\u201d blaming Joe Biden for presiding over a world that was \u201cin flames.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlessed are the peacemakers,\u201d he said in February 2024 during the campaign. \u201cAnd I promise I will be your peacemaker in more ways than what you would think.\u201d",
      "Similarly, at his inauguration, he said: \"My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That\u2019s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier.\"",
      "Already, there are signs that Trump\u2019s electoral base is splintering. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a staunch Trump ally, wrote on X that \u201cforeign wars/intervention/regime change put America last, kill innocent people, are making us broke, and will ultimately lead to our destruction.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Vice President JD Vance has stepped in to mend the rift. Long a skeptic of sending U.S. troops into overseas conflicts, Vance wrote on X that Trump \u201cmay decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment.\"",
      "\"That decision ultimately belongs to the president,\" Vance added. \"And of course, people are right to be worried about foreign entanglement after the last 25 years of idiotic foreign policy. But I believe the president has earned some trust on this issue.\u201d",
      "A CNBC poll of 1,000 U.S. adults in April found that 53% disapproved of Trump\u2019s foreign policy, compared with only 42% who approved.",
      "Another Middle East option \u2014 potentially an off-ramp \u2014 is for Trump to leverage the Israeli offensive to persuade Iran to make concessions and abandon any uranium enrichment. Iran has steadfastly refused so far.",
      "\u201cI do think he\u2019s genuinely confused about what his best option is,\u201d said John Bolton, a White House national security adviser in Trump\u2019s first term who is now a staunch critic. \u201cThis was not supposed to happen this way. There were supposed to be more negotiations\u201d over dismantling Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "\u201cTrump has lost direction and momentum and being in control of what\u2019s happening, and that rattles him, too,\u201d Bolton added.",
      "Campaigning for a second term, Trump suggested that he had mastered the art of statecraft in ways that would keep the world safe. With his negotiating skills and his personal knowledge of the combatants in Ukraine and Russia, he said, he would end that war immediately. He also vowed that if voters re-elected him, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have peace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "What he has discovered is that both conflicts reflect historical grievance and raw political calculations that don\u2019t vanish when a new president takes power, foreign policy experts said. Presidents often learn that the hard way. Republican former President George W. Bush used the military to try to build a stable, free democracy in Iraq, with limited results.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of naivete on the part of the president as to what could or couldn\u2019t be done,\u201d said a former Trump administration national security official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cI think he put a lot of stock in his ability to negotiate, and it\u2019s a different world than it was the first time he was in office.\u201d",
      "A second former Trump administration official said: \"He has great abilities to negotiate, and he\u2019s proved that from his first term. But here he likely underestimated the internal politics of these conflicts for the different players involved.\"",
      "A pair of raging wars in different parts of the world would be tough for any president to manage. An added complication in Trump\u2019s case is that he presides over a turbulent national security team that he doesn\u2019t appear to entirely trust.",
      "Asked about a previous statement by Tulsi Gabbard, his director of national intelligence, that Iran wasn\u2019t building a nuclear weapon, Trump told reporters Tuesday, \u201cI don\u2019t care what she said,\u201d adding that Iran was \u201cvery close\u201d to acquiring one.",
      "Rather than rely on the nation\u2019s foreign policy apparatus, Trump has given some of the most sensitive diplomatic assignments to a friend, former real estate magnate Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got one card that he\u2019s playing, and that\u2019s Witkoff. Witkoff does not have a background in this but has his [Trump's] confidence,\u201d the second former official said. \u201cThe whole foreign policy structure has been gutted.\u201d",
      "Trump has pared the National Security Council staff and given Secretary of State Marco Rubio the dual role of also heading the National Security Council, which is supposed to coordinate the work of different agencies and make sure different perspectives are heard.",
      "\u201cIs it a team, or is it a competing set of mutually hostile groups that don\u2019t trust one another?\u201d Daniel Fried, a former U.S. ambassador to Poland, asked rhetorically. \u201cThat is not a formula for success.\u201d"

      "MADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s government said Tuesday that the massive April power outage across Spain and Portugal that left tens of millions of people disconnected in seconds was caused by technical and planning errors that left the grid unable to handle a surge in voltage.",
      "Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen, who manages the nation\u2019s energy policy, told reporters that a voltage surge led to small grid failures, mainly in the south of Spain, which then cascaded to larger ones and brought the system down in the two Iberian Peninsula nations.",
      "She ruled out that the failure was due to a cyberattack.",
      "The outage began shortly after noon on April 28 in Spain and lasted through nightfall, disrupting businesses, transit systems, cellular networks, internet connectivity and other critical infrastructure. Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 or about 60% of its supply. Portugal, whose grid is connected to Spain\u2019s, also went down. Only the countries\u2019 island territories were spared.",
      "\u201cAll of this happened in 12 seconds, with most of the power loss happening in just five seconds,\u201d Aagesen said.",
      "Several technical causes contributed to the event, including \u201cpoor planning\u201d by Spain\u2019s grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica, which didn\u2019t find a replacement for one power plant that was supposed to help balance power fluctuations, the minister said. She also said that some power plants that utilities shut off preventively when the disruptions started could have stayed online to help manage the system.",
      "Power was fully restored by the early hours of the following day.",
      "The government\u2019s report was to be released later Tuesday \u2014 49 days after the event \u2014 and included analysis from Spain\u2019s national security agencies, which concluded, according to the minister, that there were no indications of cyber-sabotage by foreign actors.",
      "The government had previously narrowed down the source of the outage to three power plants that tripped in southern Spain.",
      "In the weeks following the blackout, citizens and experts were left wondering what triggered the event in a region not known for power cuts. The outage ignited a fierce debate about whether Spain\u2019s high levels of renewable power and not enough energy generated from nuclear or gas-fired power plants had something to do with the grid failing, which the government has repeatedly denied.",
      "Spain is at the forefront of Europe\u2019s transition to renewable energy, having generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and solar. The country is also phasing out its nuclear plants.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed back against such speculation and defended the country\u2019s rapid ramping up of renewables. He asked for patience and said that his government would not \u201cdeviate a single millimeter\u201d from its energy transition plans, which include a goal of generating 81% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030."

In April, Pyongyang and Moscow said that their soldiers fought together to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, though Ukraine has insisted it still has troops present there.",
      "Wrapping up a one-day visit to Pyongyang, Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu said that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un decided to send 1,000 sappers to clear mines in the Kursk region and 5,000 military construction workers to restore infrastructure there, according to Russia\u2019s state news agency, Tass.",
      "Another Russian state news agency, RIA Novosti, carried a similar report.",
      "\u201cFollowing the expulsion of invaders from Russian soil, we\u2019ve agreed to continue our constructive cooperation, with the Korean side providing assistance in the restoration of the Kursk region,\u201d Shoigu said, according to RIA Novosti. \u201cThis is a kind of brotherly aid being sent by the Korean people and their leader, Kim Jong Un, to our country.\u201d",
      "Shoigu said that Moscow and Pyongyang agreed to erect memorials in both countries in honor of North Korean soldiers who died while fighting in the Kursk region, according to Tass and RIA Novosti.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday that Kim confirmed the contents of North Korea\u2019s cooperation with Russia with regard to Kursk\u2019s current situation but did not mention the dispatch of army construction workers and deminers cited by Russian media.",
      "KCNA quoted Kim as expressing his resolve to \u201cinvariably and unconditionally support\u201d what he called Russian efforts to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Kim has previously made similar comments in support of Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "KCNA also said that Kim and Shoigu approved some plans for \u201cconveying long the heroic feats displayed by\u201d North Korean troops in operations to liberate the Kursk area, an apparent reference to the memorial construction plan.",
      "North Korea and Russia have never disclosed how many North Korean troops have been sent to Russia or how many of them were killed. But according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian assessments, about 15,000 North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia. South Korea\u2019s spy agency said in April that about 600 North Korean soldiers died on the Russia-Ukraine battlefronts.",
      "The deepening ties between North Korea and Russia have raised worries among the U.S., South Korea and their partners that Russian President Vladimir Putin may in return provide Kim with much-needed sophisticated technologies that can help advance his nuclear and missile programs.",
      "The two countries, both in confrontations with the U.S. and its allies, have sharply grown closer to each other in recent years. In 2024, Kim and Putin signed a landmark defense treaty that requires each side to provide aid if the other is attacked.",
      "It was Shoigu\u2019s third visit to North Korea in about three months. The two countries have exchanged high-level visits in past years, with Kim traveling to Russia in 2023 and Putin to North Korea in 2024. Many observers say Kim could soon visit Russia again for another summit with Putin.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Russia\u2019s employment of North Korean workers was a clear violation of U.N. sanctions, which require member states not to issue work permits to North Koreans.",
      "The U.S. State Department told South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency that Russia\u2019s continued use of North Korean workers and soldiers was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d and that Pyongyang was \u201cnow relying on Russia to provide it with desperately needed funds in exchange for labor and soldier for hire schemes.\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also expressed deep concern, saying advancing cooperation between Russia and North Korea threatens to jeopardize global security.",
      "On Wednesday, South Korea, the U.S. and Japan flew fighter jets for a trilateral aerial training off South Korea\u2019s southern Jeju island as part of their efforts to strengthen security cooperation to cope with North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats, according to the South Korean air force."

      "Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout Tuesday as Israel continued to bombard the country.",
      "Two companies that track global internet connectivity, Kentik and Netblocks, told NBC News that Iran\u2019s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world as the country becomes more deeply involved in conflict.",
      "The drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran\u2019s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran\u2019s government, said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. Most recently, in 2019, it implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.",
      "The country\u2019s internet access has been reduced, but not fully blocked, in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran last week, which Iran has said killed at least 224 people. Israel said Iran\u2019s retaliatory attacks have killed at least 24.",
      "The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks used to access foreign sites.",
      "Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, told NBC News that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, had been blocked in the country.",
      "A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran, which has been blocking internet providers used by the company.",
      "Iran\u2019s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran.",
      "Data published Tuesday by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.",

      "While Starlink does not formally have an option to operate within Iran\u2019s borders, it does offer users a Global Roam option, marketed for international travel. Starlink\u2019s parent company, SpaceX, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit group that advocates for information access in closed societies, said it estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink terminals are spread across Iran, based on network scans and conversations with people involved in selling them to people in the country.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s National Cybersecurity Command announced that Israel had launched a broad cyberwarfare campaign against Iran\u2019s digital infrastructure to disrupt services to the public, but it did not provide specifics of what was affected.",
      "The Iranian news site Shargh Daily reported that Iran\u2019s cyber police agency, FATA, said Tuesday that the government had imposed some internet disruptions after the cyberattacks and that service would be restored soon.",
      "The statement came after a prominent pro-Israel hacker group that calls itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram, where it maintains a social media presence, to have conducted a destructive cyberattack against Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for allegations of ties to Iran\u2019s military.",
      "Some Iranian ATMs were not functional Tuesday, a source on the ground said.",

      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre\u2019s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What\u2019s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "The Mona Lisa\u2019s daily mob",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff planned to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "A museum in limbo",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks."
