      "For the first time in nearly 2,000 years, visitors to Rome\u2019s Colosseum can walk through a hidden imperial passage",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 For the first time in nearly 2,000 years, visitors to Rome\u2019s world-renowned Colosseum will have the opportunity to walk through a hidden imperial passage that once allowed Roman emperors to reach the ancient amphitheater unseen.",
      "The once-secret corridor \u2014 known as the \u201cCommodus Passage\u201d and named after the Roman emperor turned into a pop icon by Ridley Scott\u2019s movie \u201cGladiator\u201d \u2014 opens to the public on Oct. 27, marking an extraordinary milestone in archaeological preservation and access.",
      "Archaeologists at the Colosseum Archaeological Park explained that Roman emperors would use the passage to enter the arena unseen and protected, leading them directly to their reserved honor box overlooking the games.",
      "The passage was named after Emperor Commodus, who lived between 180 and 192 A.D., when it was initially discovered in the 1810s. Commodus was known to be passionate about gladiators\u2019 games and history relates that while he was passing through the tunnel, someone attempted to assassinate him, but was unsuccessful.",
      "At the passage entrance, archaeologists discovered remnants of decorative elements directly related to arena spectacles, including depictions of boar hunts, bear fights and acrobatic performances. These artistic elements provided a fitting prelude to the brutal entertainments that awaited beyond, they noted.",
      "The corridor is shaped as an \u2019S\u2019 and continues outside the Colosseum arena, but its final destination remains uncertain.",

      "The project \u2014 completed between Oct. 2024 and Sept. 2025 \u2014 included structural conservation, restoration of decorative stuccoes and plasters and the installation of a new walkway.",

      "A second restoration project, expected to begin in early 2026, will involve the section of the tunnel extending beyond the perimeter of the Colosseum.",

      "In Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d Yale academics go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield",
      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",
      "A sign of what Guadagnino might be up to comes not long after, after Maggie has alleged the assault. Alma goes to meet a distraught Hank at a local restaurant. While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",
      "I'm not sure \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has too much more to say than that shrug-of-the-shoulders scene.

It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",

      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",
      "Roc Nation founder Jay-Z said in a statement that what Bad Bunny has \u201cdone and continues to do for Puerto Rico is truly inspiring. We are honored to have him on the world\u2019s biggest stage.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tenor Rolando Villaz\u00f3n was singing the title role in Massenet's \u201cWerther\u201d in 2006 at Nice, France, when he started thinking about how he would direct the opera.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018oh, this last act is very difficult. He shot himself and keeps singing for 40 minutes.' And so, what would I do?\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd I started inventing, creating for fun a staging.\u201d",
      "Nearly two decades later, Villaz\u00f3n is making his Metropolitan Opera directing debut in Bellini's \u201cLa Sonnambula,\u201d which opened Monday night with a standout cast of Nadine Sierra, Xabier Anduaga and Alexander Vinogradov.",
      "\u201cHe is very sensitive to singers,\u201d Sierra said. \u201cMaybe some directors, because they\u2019re not singers or they were never singers, it\u2019s hard for them to really relate to the psychological struggle that some singers, we deal with on stage. We want to make our characters as believable as humanly possible through the actions that we show, but sometimes it\u2019s hard to do that because you also have to sing high notes.\u201d",
      "Villaz\u00f3n grew up in Mexico City, won Pl\u00e1cido Domingo\u2019s Operalia competition in 1999 and made his European debut that year in Massenet\u2019s \u201cManon\u201d at Genoa, Italy. He debuted at the Met in Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata\u201d in 2003 and gained wide renown when he sang Alfredo with Anna Netrebko\u2019s Violetta in Willy Decker\u2019s austere staging at the 2005 Salzburg Festival.",
      "Vocal problems developed in 2007, causing Villaz\u00f3n to cancel his schedule, and he had surgery in 2009 to remove a cyst from his vocal cords. He developed performance anxiety around 2015 and had another operation in 2018 to relieve acid reflux.",
      "\u201cTwo things coincided when I stopped singing for a year in 2009 \u2014 and that was I wrote my first novel and I prepared my staging, but both didn\u2019t happen because I was resting,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have finished my novel? I don\u2019t know. But stage direction for sure that would have happened.\u201d",
      "When Villaz\u00f3n conceived his \u201cWerther\u201d staging, he shared it with Alain Lanceron, then head of the tenor's record label, Virgin Classics. Richard Jones, a director Villaz\u00f3n had worked with, helped him find a theater. After being turned down in Berlin, Villaz\u00f3n won over Serge Dorny, then general director in Lyon and now head of the Bavarian State Op\u00e9ra.",
      "Villaz\u00f3n's \u201cWerther\u201d debuted in 2011, and he directed Donizetti\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore\u201d the following year at Baden-Baden, Germany, while also singing Nemorino.",
      "He has gone on to direct Verdi\u2019s \u201cLa Traviata,\u201d Donizetti\u2019s \u201cDon Pasquale,\u201d Strauss\u2019s \u201cDie Fledermaus,\u201d Rameau\u2019s \u201cPlat\u00e9e,\u201d Bellini\u2019s \u201cI Puritani\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cIl Barbiere di Siviglia,\u201d and has upcoming productions of Mozart\u2019s \u201c Die Zauberfl\u00f6te\u201d and Rossini\u2019s \u201cL\u2019Italiana in Algeri.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Derek Cianfrance goes to extreme lengths to make immersive environments for his actors",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The lengths writer-director Derek Cianfrance goes to create immersive environments for his actors has grown into a kind of legend. After making the much-improvised doomed romance of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d (2010), Michelle Williams said she would have to remind herself that she was never, actually, married to Ryan Gosling.",
      "Cianfrance\u2019s last feature, 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Light Between the Oceans,\u201d was shot almost entirely at a remote New Zealand lighthouse. The making of that film did lead together its stars, Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander. So did Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d with Gosling and Eva Mendes. Method filmmaking can produce real-life results.",
      "But Cianfrance\u2019s ways are for a purpose. He wants his actors, as much as possible, to live in a movie. For his latest film, \u201cRoofman,\u201d starring Channing Tatum and Kirsten Dunst, that approach was especially important because the story was so far-fetched.",
      "\u201cI wanted to immerse the entire cast in this story because it\u2019s a crazy story,\u201d Cianfrance said in an interview. \u201cJeff\u2019s actions are kind of unbelievable. I felt like just for me, to have my suspension of disbelief, I needed to be down there. I think that\u2019s why I do a lot of this immersion because I need to believe it. I need to believe it\u2019s actually happening.\u201d",
      "In \u201cRoofman,\u201d which Paramount Pictures releases Friday in theaters, Tatum plays Jeffrey Manchester, a U.S. Army veteran who found civilian life difficult. In 1998, he began robbing McDonald\u2019s by sawing through roofs. He\u2019s believed to have robbed more than 40 stores. Both his novel entry point, and his reported cordial manner with employees, made the \u201cRoofman\u201d an intriguing figure on the local TV news.",
      "In 2000, Manchester was caught in North Carolina and was later sentenced to 45 years in prison. But in 2004, he escaped and, to elude the authorities, hid out in a Charlotte Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. He clandestinely lived there for months, eating what was on the shelves, and, most audaciously, trying to live a seemingly normal life outside the store. He attended a local church and dated a woman named Leigh Wainscott (played by Dunst).",
      "Mostly, the events of \u201cRoofman\u201d happened as they\u2019re portrayed. But how do you make a stranger-than-fiction tale believable? For the filmmakers of \u201cRoofman,\u201d it meant going to some extreme lengths to give real-life authenticity to a made-for-Hollywood story. At a time when major studios seldom release star-led original films at all, let alone fiercely realistic ones shot on location, \u201cRoofman\u201d \u2014 a modest sized production cobbled together with an assortment of companies, including Miramax, FilmNation and Limelight \u2014 effectively tunneled its way to the big screen.",
      "\u201cI had many producers tell me: Why don\u2019t you shoot this in South Africa? You\u2019ll have double the amount of days,\u201d Cianfrance says, referencing the appeal of tax credits. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, because the people aren\u2019t there, and the ghosts of this story aren\u2019t there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Cianfrance wanted to shoot in the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us where Manchester hid out, but he couldn\u2019t. The toy chain went bankrupt in 2017, and the one where Manchester camped out in is now a mega church. So, he turned an abandoned Toys \u201cR\u201d Us in Pineville, North Carolina, into a nearly fully operational one. The production redid the electricity, added plumbing, installed new fluorescent lighting and stocked 40,000 square feet of shelves with truckloads of period-appropriate toys.",
      "\u201cThat was my \u2018Fitzcarraldo,\u2019 bringing the steam ship over the mountain, building that Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us,\u201d Cianfrance says, chuckling.",
      "That gave Tatum, whom Cianfrance had initially sought for \u201cBlue Valentine,\u201d a box store sandbox in which to play. The biggest gift Cianfrance could give to Tatum, he felt, was \u201cto unleash him in a toy store.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was 360, all around,\u201d says Tatum, speaking alongside Dunst. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a giant budget movie. It involved, like: \u2018There\u2019s not even enough toys from this era in the world to fill this place.\u2019 And Derek kept going. \u2018I promised Chan that he would have a fully working store where he could do whatever he wanted.\u2019 He put it on me!\u201d",
      "Dunst was particularly drawn to Cianfrance\u2019s process. \u201cThe kind of acting that Derek likes,\u201d Dunst says, \u201cis the kind of acting that I like: when it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s acting.\u201d",

      "\u201cJeff wrote a crazy movie for himself, and he lived it,\u201d Cianfrance says. \u201cWhat made me ultimately understand what the movie was that Jeff \u2014 he was just trying to figure out how to be a dad. He was doing it all for family.\u201d",

But they had not anticipated the anti-feminist question, which was perhaps less a question than an accusation.",
      "\u201cThis question was so tone deaf to the movie itself,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cLike, you\u2019ve mistaken the subject with the object.\u201d",
      "The film is an ensemble piece about a few characters in and around Yale whose heady philosophical chats about agency and power become less theoretical under the glare of sticky real life dramas. Roberts plays Alma, a revered professor up for tenure alongside her colleague and flirty drinking buddy Hank (Garfield). Edebiri is a student named Maggie, a child of billionaires who everyone says is brilliant and who is a little obsessed with Alma.",
      "After a boozy party at Alma\u2019s, Maggie comes to Alma first to tell her that Hank crossed the line. Hank denies anything happened and claims that Maggie is retaliating because he accused her of plagiarizing her thesis. No one knows quite who to believe. Alma, too, is harboring her own secrets. And everything in their world unravels in spectacularly melodramatic fashion.",
      "The screenplay comes from Nora Garrett, who was working as a data analyst at Meta before her script caught the attention of Guadagnino and Roberts, in quick succession.",
      "\u201cThe story really started with the character of Alma,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cI was really interested in this idea of a woman who had a lie or something that she was deeply ashamed of at the core of her being.\u201d",
      "But Alma's controlled compartmentalization of her past starts to unspool with Maggie's accusation. The part allows Roberts to do some of her best work in years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m saying something that might sound obvious, but she\u2019s one of the greatest stars and one of the great actresses,\u201d Guadagnino said. \u201cThe symbol, the beauty of the symbol, and at the same time the truth of the performance. She\u2019s so three-dimensional.\u201d",
      "Roberts was particularly fascinated by Alma\u2019s relationship with her husband, Frederik, a shrink played by Guadagnino regular Michael Stuhlbarg, whose unexpected choices had her in awe.",
      "\u201cI did catch myself watching him a couple of times instead of being in the scene and I was just like, \u2018Wow, that\u2019s so (expletive) good,\u2019\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd then I think, \u2018Oh, I have a line.\u2019\u201d",

Garfield, who Guadagnino has been trying to work with for almost 20 years, had to do one of his most emotional scenes on his first day. He\u2019d come straight from a very different kind of film where he was playing \u201ca very goofy dad\u201d and was panicked.",
      "\u201cI was really struggling to transition,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cI wanted to make sure I came in as full and hot as possible.

      "\u201cI thought a lot about films that have been able to resist the pressure of time and to become some insightful classics,\u201d Guadagnino said.",
      "Perhaps the most inscrutable of the bunch is Maggie. Even Edebiri said she had some trouble wrapping her head around her motivations and actions.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a tricky girl,\u201d Edebiri said. \u201cA word Luca kept using a lot in conversations was displacement. Maggie\u2019s such a displaced person psychologically, but also as a transracial adoptee, and occupying this space full of these professors who are performing.\u201d",
      "But the point for all are the questions, not the answers, and \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is not a film that wraps anything up in a tidy morality. Those conversations are for the audience to have.",
      "\u201cThere are very few filmmakers who are alive for whom the priority is radical, vulnerable, unbridled self-expression and exploration and curiosity rather than something didactic,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cThe conversation is the thing, I think, that\u2019s the most we can ever dream of, that people will be confronted by their own response. The film hopefully is a mirror for every person watching, and then they can compare reflections with each other.\"",

      "Taylor Swift's new film, \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d has topped the weekend box office with $33 million in North America",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 This weekend\u2019s box office belonged to two undeniable draws: Taylor Swift and Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson.",
      "It might have looked like a heavyweight matchup, but Swift\u2019s devoted fanbase once again proved unstoppable with her film \u201cThe Official Release Party of a Show Girl,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 with $33 million in North America, according to Sunday estimates from Comscore. The AMC Theatres release -- announced only two weeks ago with minimal promotion -- served as a companion piece to Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, packaging music videos, behind-the-scenes footage and profanity-free lyric visuals into an 89-minute experience.",
      "The film played at all 540 AMC theaters in the U.S. for three days, ending after Sunday. AMC aired the show in Mexico, Canada and across Europe.",
      "\u201cFor Taylor Swift to harness the power of the movie theater to build her brand, create excitement among her fans, and create a communal experience outside of her touring, outside of her live performances, is really a stroke of genius,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cTo be able to add another $33 million to the box office bottom line is much welcomed by theater owners who were looking for content for their big screens.\u201d",
      "It comes nearly two years after her \u201cThe Eras Tour\u201d concert film opened to $96 million, with Swift extending her streak of box office dominance.",
      "Meanwhile, Johnson saw a more modest showing. His A24 drama \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d co-starring Emily Blunt, opened in third place with a mere $6 million, trailing Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d which earned $11.1 million and has now accumulated $107 million globally.",
      "Despite strong reviews and a 15-minute standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival -- where Johnson drew praise for portraying MMA legend Mark Kerr \u2014 the film marked one of the lowest openings as a lead.",
      "\u201cWhen major movie stars branch out into more indie roles, like Tom Cruise in \u201dMagnolia,\" they're trying to redefine their career,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThey can straddle both universes, so Dwayne Johnson and all the acclaim he\u2019s getting. That prestige factor. That\u2019s the currency. He knows box office. He studies this and he's a business person. But also realize that when you go outside of your comfort zone, it puts him in a certain light. ... Dwayne Johnson is redefining what he can do.\u201d",
      "Beyond the two marquee names, the rest of the weekend lineup offered a wide mix ranging from animated adventures to horror sequels and international releases.",
      "DreamWorks Animation\u2019s family adventure \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie\u201d debuted in fourth place with $5.2 million, expanding the popular Netflix preschool series to the big screen. Warner Bros.\u2019 supernatural thriller \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rites\u201d followed in fifth with $4 million, pulling in $458.2 million globally.",
      "In sixth was \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba \u2013 Infinity Castle,\u201d the latest entry in the hit Japanese anime saga, earning $3.5 million. A re-release of \u201cAvatar: The Way of Water\u201d made a splash in seventh with $3.1 million \u2014 a solid return for the 2022 blockbuster ahead of \u201cAvatar: The Fire and Ash\u201d on Dec. 19.",
      "Rounding out the top 10 were \u201cThe Strangers: Chapter 2\u201d with $2.8 million, the IFC dark comedy \u201cGood Boy\u201d with $2.2 million, marking the company's second-best opening weekend ever. \u201cKantara: A Legend \u2013 Chapter 1\u201d with $1.7 million.",
      "Dergarabedian said he's looking forward to October films such as \u201cTron: Ares,\u201d \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d and \u201cRoofman,\" starring Channing Tatum.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge remained undecided Friday on the treatment and placement plan for a man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and ramming his car into the front gate of her home.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, a 48-year-old from Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism. But in May, Judge Maria Cavalluzzi found him not competent to stand trial after evaluations from two experts. At Friday\u2019s hearing in a Los Angeles court dedicated to mental health cases, she heard arguments on Carwyle's treatment and placement.",
      "Aniston\u2019s lawyer, Blair Berk, spoke on her behalf for the first time, detailing two years of Carwyle\u2019s harassment and stalking, including various failed attempts to make physical contact with the actor.",
      "Cavalluzzi said she leaned toward sending Carwyle to a mental health treatment alternative to imprisonment. She requested another hearing, scheduled for later this month, to hear from a mental health professional before making a final decision.",
      "Prosecutors and Aniston\u2019s attorney will have a chance to weigh in, Cavalluzzi said.",
      "The judge acknowledged Aniston's \u201cvery real\" fear, but she said she can't ignore the opinions of mental health professionals who have evaluated Carwyle and deemed him not a danger to society. The alternative treatment option offers community-based housing, treatment and support services as opposed to incarceration.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, \u201conly feet away from where she was,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Carwyle had a stated and \u201cpersistent delusion\u201d to impregnate Aniston with three children, Berk said, and \u201cthere is simply no way to prevent him from carrying out his delusion if he walks out.\u201d",
      "The prosecution expressed concern that if Carwyle were offered the treatment in Los Angeles, nothing would stop him \u201cfrom traveling those few miles to Ms. Aniston,\u201d Berk said.",
      "Berk and William Donovan, the deputy district attorney, argued Carwyle was a present danger to Aniston and those around her. Berk said he attempted to enter her property twice, but was turned away.",
      "Carwyle\u2019s lawyer, Robert Krauss, said his client qualifies for alternative treatment, arguing that he hasn\u2019t been convicted of violent crimes. Granting him alternative treatment, \u201cis not like giving him a break or showing him leniency,\u201d Krauss said. \u201cIts just one thing and one thing only \u2014 and that is absolute, pure faithfulness of the law.\u201d",
      "Krauss also referenced a report from the probation department, which recommended Carwyle be granted probation and 90 days in jail if convicted, much less than the over three years maximum sentence for his two charges. Carwyle has been in jail since May and, if convicted, could be let out with time served.",

      "When Cavalluzzi asked how she can be sure he won\u2019t walk away from the treatment program \u2014 a stated concern from the prosecution \u2014 Carwyle responded, \u201cYou have my word.\u201d",
      "Berk said Carwyle \u201ctraveled thousands of miles over a year ago \u201cafter sending thousands of messages\" that reflected \u201chis delusions and intentions to not just make contact with Ms. Aniston, but to commit criminal wrongs against her, sexual violence against her.\u201d She added that Carwyle stressed in his messaging that he \u201cwould be unabated by doctors or others or FBI intervening.\u201d",
      "Donovan argued that a state hospital is a \u201cmuch safer, much more effective place for him to go,\u201d and will offer the treatment Carwyle needs to address his delusions. The prosecution also argued there\u2019s no evidence that Carwyle\u2019s delusions toward Aniston have stopped, even with medication.",
      "Carwyle has been under involuntary medication for the past few months. Krauss said that Carwyle's actions toward Aniston were \u201cjust the product of psychosis from someone who is unmedicated.\" The government must keep its \u201cpromise of treatment rather than punishment and of rehabilitation rather than incarceration,\u201d he said.",
      "The hearing was postponed several times in recent months as Carwyle at first objected to the incompetence finding and asked for an opinion, and both sides sought more time to examine the case.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",

      "Aniston became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) \u2014 A North Dakota judge has upheld the state\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for children, in a blow to families who have had to travel out of state to obtain the medical treatments they said are crucial for their kids\u2019 well-being.",
      "District Judge Jackson Lofgren's said in his decision Wednesday that the law discriminates based on age and medical purpose, not sex, and that there's little evidence the Legislature passed the law for \u201can invidious discriminatory purpose.\u201d He also noted various concerns and ongoing debates over the medical treatments involved.",
      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",
      "The ruling means parents who decided to seek gender-affirming medical care for their children after the state's ban took effect in April 2023 will need to do so out of state.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",
      "Republican state Rep. Bill Tveit, who introduced the legislation, said he is pleased with the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt's a law that needs to be there. We need to protect our youth, and that's what the whole goal of this thing was from the beginning,\u201d Tveit said.",
      "The lawsuit was brought by several affected families and a pediatric endocrinologist, but the judge dismissed some of their claims and left only the physician as a plaintiff.",
      "About half of U.S. states, nearly all of which have fully Republican-led governments, have banned gender-affirming care for minors. North Dakota's law makes it a misdemeanor for a health care provider to prescribe or give hormone treatments or puberty blockers to a transgender child. It also makes it a felony to perform gender-affirming surgery on a minor.",

      "Although the law exempts children who were already receiving treatments before North Dakota\u2019s ban took effect, attorneys for the families who sued said providers held off because they perceived the law as vague and didn\u2019t want to risk it. That led the families to miss work and school so they could travel to Minnesota for treatment.",
      "The judge later said those kids can receive any medical care they were receiving before the law took effect, though that decision wasn\u2019t enough of a final ruling to satisfy attorneys for health care organizations. His Wednesday ruling granted a request that those kids' treatments continue, citing the law and his previous findings.",

      "The law seeks to define ultraprocessed foods, the often super-tasty products typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats. The legislation requires the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to adopt rules by mid-2028 defining \u201cultraprocessed foods of concern\u201d and \u201crestricted school foods.\u201d",
      "Schools have to start phasing out those foods by July 2029, and districts will be barred from selling them for breakfast or lunch by July 2035. Vendors will be banned from providing the \u201cfoods of concern\u201d to schools by 2032.",
      "Newsom, flanked by first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom and state lawmakers, signed the measure at a middle school in Los Angeles.",

      "Legislatures across the country have introduced more than 100 bills in recent months seeking to ban or require labeling of chemicals that make up many ultraprocessed foods, including artificial dyes and controversial additives.",
      "Americans get more than half their calories from ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, diabetes and heart disease. However, studies haven\u2019t been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "Defining ultraprocessed foods has been tricky. The most common definition is based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo.",
      "Researchers often describe ultraprocessed foods as the types of products that contain industrially made ingredients that you won\u2019t find in a home kitchen.",
      "But some highly processed foods \u2013\u2014 think tofu, certain types of whole-grain bread and infant formula \u2013 can be healthful. And it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s the processing of the foods or the combination of nutrients such as sugar, fat and salt that leads to poor health outcomes.",
      "U.S. health officials recently launched an effort to come up with a federal definition of ultraprocessed foods, saying there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health.",

      "The Kenyan capital Nairobi is renowned for having the only national park in a city",
      "KAJIADO, Kenya -- KAJIADO, Kenya (AP) \u2014 This year, less than a kilometer from where I live, a girl named Peace Mwende was killed by a lion. The news hit me hard: She was 14, the same age as my youngest daughter, and the lioness responsible may have been one of the animals we see in our neighborhood almost weekly.",
      "Our children are growing up in a part of Nairobi where lions roam free. We see them while taking our kids to school. We\u2019ve lost pets and livestock. Neighborhood WhatsApp groups share warnings when big cats come close \u2014 and feature CCTV footage of lions hunting family pets.",
      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",
      "\u201cDuring the rainy season, tall grass and shifting herbivore patterns make it difficult for carnivores to hunt,\u201d KWS wrote on a reel of a Nairobi lion cub rescue posted to its social media in July. The cub in the video had been seen starving in the park, causing a public outcry. KWS added it was \u201cconducting a feeding intervention, providing meat daily to the pride residing in the park to help them regain their strength and resume natural hunting.\u201d",
      "Nairobi National Park, bordering the city to the north, has long relied on vast southern grazing lands for its wildlife to migrate to other protected areas. With those areas fast turning into residential and industrial developments, Kenya\u2019s State Department for Wildlife announced a nearly $5 billion plan to create a migratory corridor between Nairobi and conservancies to the south. There are also nongovernment initiatives that pay landowners bordering Nairobi National Park a small annual fee to keep their properties unfenced for wildlife.",
      "But will it be enough?",
      "What\u2019s missing is greater awareness on how to behave around predators, especially among increasingly urban communities who are coming into contact with them.",
      "My children never learned this in school. Their closest encounter with a lion was in 2020, when we took advantage of a post-COVID bookings slump to show them the Maasai Mara National Reserve. An incredibly knowledgeable local guide led us through the southern reserve in a completely open safari vehicle, surrounded by surging wildebeest.",
      "On one outing, our guide stopped the car for a passing trio of hunting lionesses. The first strode by, ignoring us. The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth. My daughter sat stiff, perhaps ten inches from the lioness\u2019s head, which suddenly seemed impossibly huge.",
      "\u201cKeep still,\u201d the guide murmured under his breath. \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t make a sound.\u201d",
      "Her curiosity satisfied, the lioness ducked under the car and moved on.",
      "That day, we learned a lesson in predator behavior during a holiday experience very few Kenyans can afford. It may have recently saved my wife\u2019s life when she encountered a lioness in our garden. Checking to see what our dog was barking at, she spotted a lioness under a bush less than 10 yards away. Only its head was visible.",

He lived in our compound; he had helped to build our house and to plant many of the trees that now form the indigenous forest that surrounds our home.",
      "I called his brother, and a group went out to retrace his steps. Nothing. Two more days passed before his brother, Daniel Rono, discovered a bag of maize flour lying in a patch of wilderness between our home and Tuala. He investigated.",
      "\u201cI reached for the maize flour and saw Simon\u2019s head. It was separated from his body. I reached for the head and saw a hand, then a leg inside a gumboot,\u201d Daniel remembers. Horrified, he called me. As we started on the grisly task of trying to find Simon\u2019s remains, we were pushed back by a warning growl. It was a male lion, still guarding the kill.",
      "At this point, Simon had been missing for 2 1/2 days. No one knows whether the lion that was with him by the time we found him was responsible for his death. Lions who kill humans \u2013 the notorious man-eaters \u2013 are shot to avoid recurrence, and KWS claim to have shot the lioness that killed Peace Mwende the night of that attack.",
      "Although human-wildlife conflict has existed for as long as humans have, predator attacks are likely to rise as space for Kenya\u2019s lions shrinks and their hunting opportunities diminish. This can only spell doom for Nairobi\u2019s world-famous national park, which some already want to see turned into housing developments.",
      "I mourn Simon like the friends and colleagues who died on assignment in Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Every lion sighting also still fills me with joy and wonder, in spite of the horrors of that day in 2019. I hope solutions can be found to keep both people and lion populations safe, and that this remarkable wilderness that makes Nairobi such a unique capital city survives for the joy and wonder of many others.",

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "But in a Sept. 26 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, three pediatricians, including two with the Yale School of Medicine, said they reviewed the case and \u201care convinced that Nikki was a victim of child abuse.\u201d",

      "The Missouri attorney general\u2019s office issued subpoenas starting in late August to two employees of the Kansas City Planned Parenthood affiliate, a physician contracting with it, and two former board members of the St. Louis-area Planned Parenthood affiliate, according to Planned Parenthood court filings last month.

But while they have been able to chip away at it, they have not been able to substantially alter it as a record 24 million people are now signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "Now, some of them see the Democrats\u2019 fight as their chance to revisit the issue \u2014 putting Republican congressional leaders and President Donald Trump in a complicated position as the government shutdown enters its seventh day and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going unpaid.",
      "\u201cI am happy to work with Democrats on their Failed Healthcare Policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our Government to reopen,\u201d Trump wrote on social media Monday night, walking back earlier comments saying there were ongoing negotiations with Democrats.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has repeatedly indicated that Republicans are open to extending the subsidies, with reforms, if Democrats would reopen the government. But he has refused to negotiate until that happens \u2014 and has suggested Trump will be key to the eventual outcome.",
      "Thune told reporters Monday \u201cthere may be a path forward\u201d on ACA subsidies, but stressed, \u201cI think a lot of it would come down to where the White House lands on that.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in its latest LGBTQ+ rights case Tuesday, weighing the constitutionality of bans passed by nearly half of U.S. states on the practice known as conversion therapy for children.",
      "The justices are hearing a lawsuit from a Christian counselor challenging a Colorado law that prohibits therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity. Kaley Chiles, with support from President Donald Trump's Republican administration, argues the law violates her freedom of speech by barring her from offering voluntary, faith-based therapy for kids.",
      "Colorado, on the other hand, says the measure simply regulates licensed therapists by barring a practice that's been scientifically discredited and linked to serious harm.",
      "The arguments come months after the Supreme Court's conservative majority found states can ban transition-related health care for transgender youths, a setback for LGBTQ rights. The justices are also expected to hear a case about sports participation by transgender players this term.",
      "Colorado has not sanctioned anyone under the 2019 law, which exempts religious ministries. State attorneys say it still allows any therapist to have wide-ranging, faith-based conversations with young patients about gender and sexuality.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that the law prohibits therapists from doing is performing a treatment that seeks the predetermined outcome of changing a minor\u2019s sexual orientation or gender identity because that treatment is unsafe and ineffective,\u201d Colorado state attorneys wrote.",
      "Therapy isn't just speech, they said \u2014 it's health care that governments have a responsibility to regulate. Violating the law carries potential fines of $5,000 and license suspension or even revocation.",
      "Linda Robertson is a Christian mom of four from Washington state whose son Ryan underwent therapy that promised to change his sexual orientation after he came out to her at age 12. The techniques led him to blame himself when it didn\u2019t work, leaving him ashamed and depressed. He died in 2009, after multiple suicide attempts and a drug overdose at age 20.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in conversion therapy, it devastated Ryan\u2019s bond with me and my husband,\" she said. \u201cAnd it absolutely destroyed his confidence he could ever be loved or accepted by God.\u201d",
      "Chiles contends her approach is different from the kind of conversion therapy once associated with practices like shock therapy decades ago. She said she believes \u201cpeople flourish when they live consistently with God\u2019s design, including their biological sex,\" and she argues evidence of harm from her approach is lacking.",
      "Chiles says Colorado is discriminating because it allows counselors to affirm minors coming out as gay or identifying as transgender but bans counseling like hers for young patients who may want to change their behavior or feelings. \u201cWe're not saying this counseling should be mandatory, but if someone wants the counseling they should be able to get it,\u201d said one of her attorneys, Jonathan Scruggs.",

Chiles should also be free from that kind of state regulation, the group argued.",
      "Still, the Supreme Court has also found that regulations that only \u201cincidentally\u201d burden speech are permissible, and the state argues that striking down its law against conversion therapy would undercut states' ability to regulate discredited health care of all kids.",
      "The high court agreed to hear the case after the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver upheld the law. Another appeals court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, has struck down similar bans in Florida.",

      "Experts say a food aid program that helps 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money unless the government shutdown ends within two weeks",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A food aid program that helps more than 6 million low-income mothers and young children will run out of federal money within two weeks unless the government shutdown ends, forcing states to use their own money to keep it afloat or risk it shutting down, experts say.",
      "The $8 billion Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, also known as WIC, provides vouchers to buy infant formula as well as fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat milk and other healthy staples that are often out of financial reach for low-income households.",
      "The shutdown, which began Wednesday, coincided with the beginning of a new fiscal year, meaning programs like WIC, which rely on annual infusions from the federal government, are nearly out of money. Currently, the program is being kept afloat by an $150 million contingency fund, but experts say it could run dry quickly.",
      "After that, states could step in to pay for the program and seek reimbursement when a budget finally passes, but not all states say they can afford to do so.",
      "\u201cWe feel good about one to two weeks,\u201d said Ali Hard, policy director for the National WIC Association. \u201cAfter that, we are very worried.\u201d",
      "Taylor Moyer, a mother of three who recently separated from her husband, has been receiving WIC since her first son was born nine years ago. She said the program allowed her to feed her children nutritious food that tends to be pricier than calorie-dense, processed options. It also provided guidance when she struggled to breastfeed and counseled her on how to handle her son's picky eating stage.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been times where I have sat back in my house and really wondered how I was going to feed my family,\u201d said Moyer, who works at the LGBT Life Center in Virginia Beach, Virginia. \u201cAnd I went to the store with my WIC card ... I get rice, I got avocados, I got eggs, and I made a balanced meal that was actually good.\u201d",
      "The shutdown came as Democrats and Republicans failed to pass a new spending plan. Democratic lawmakers want to extend tax credits that make health care cheaper for millions of Americans, and they want to reverse deep cuts to Medicaid that were passed earlier this year. They refused to sign on to any spending plan that did not include those provisions.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, blamed Democrats for the shutdown and called them hypocritical because failing to fund the federal government endangers so many health programs.",
      "The WIC program, which has long had bipartisan support, aids those who are pregnant, mothers and children under age 5. Research has tied it to lower infant mortality, healthier birth weights, higher immunization rates and better academic outcomes for children who participate. Nearly half of those who are eligible don't enroll, often because they believe they don't qualify or they can't reach a WIC office.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers want to cut WIC, which is targeted for elimination in Project 2025, the influential policy blueprint authored by the man who's now President Donald Trump\u2019s budget chief. Trump\u2019s budget request and the spending plan backed by House Republicans would not fully fund the program. They also want to cut funding for families to buy fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "In the event of an extended shutdown, several states have sought to reassure WIC recipients that they will continue to receive benefits. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said the state will pick up the tab if federal funding runs out.",

      "Mississippi also pledged current WIC recipients will continue receiving benefits, but it temporarily suspended enrollment for new participants except for those who are pregnant, breastfeeding or seeking benefits for high-risk infants.",
      "In Washington state, where a third of babies receive WIC benefits, officials say they do not have the money to keep the program open.",
      "\u201cWashington WIC may be able to sustain benefits for one to two weeks before a federal shutdown would force a full closure of the program,\u201d said Raechel Sims, a spokesperson for the state's Department of Health. \u201cIf the shutdown lasts longer than that, DOH does not have the ability to backfill WIC funding.\u201d",

      "Edilson Trindade, the manager who has worked at the bar since 2018, told The Associated Press the establishment usually sells about 80 caipirinhas \u2014 Brazil\u2019s national cocktail made with cacha\u00e7a, lime, sugar and ice \u2014 each night. Last week, he didn\u2019t sell a single one. No other cocktails were ordered, either.",
      "\u201cClients have been worried, and we\u2019re advising them it\u2019s better not to drink cocktails,\u201d Trindade said.",
      "His concern reflects a nationwide unease over distilled beverages following a surge in methanol poisoning cases that has prompted police investigations, stoked public fear and altered drinking habits in recent days.",
      "The Health Ministry said Friday it had confirmed 11 cases tied to alcoholic beverages and was investigating 116 suspected cases. One death was confirmed through lab tests in Sao Paulo, with eleven others under investigation.",
      "Nearly all the cases have been reported in Sao Paulo, the country's most populous state and the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "Last week, local media reported deaths and hospitalizations linked to methanol-tainted alcohol. Some patients were admitted to intensive care with severe symptoms, including blindness.",
      "One of them was the rapper Hungria, who has been hospitalized in Brasilia after possibly drinking altered alcohol. On Friday, he posted on his Instagram account that he was feeling better and would soon be discharged.",
      "\"Friday has a different energy. If you feel thirsty, find a safe place to have a drink,\" the singer said.",
      "Health Minister Alexandre Padilha urged Brazilians to avoid drinking, especially distilled beverages, which are more difficult to verify for adulteration.

      "Instead, couples can learn habits that help them get rest while boosting the relationship long term.",
      "It\u2019s understandable to want to discuss a problem before letting it fester, Whiten said, but it\u2019s unrealistic to expect conflicts to be wrapped up quickly and lovingly before drifting off to sleep.",

We are happy to help you with that cough drop. But really the mission is so much greater. It\u2019s showing that we care, and we\u2019re there for them. So when that cough becomes pneumonia, they\u2019ll let us listen to their lungs and maybe trust us to take them to the hospital.\u201d",

      "One challenge is the transient nature of homeless people, which makes it difficult to provide continual care. Dr. Armen Henderson, founder of Dade County Street Response, said the problem is compounded by laws that target homeless people.",
      "\u201cThe criminalization of homelessness has significantly impacted our patients\u2019 ability to be in one place to get services,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cFor the street medicine team, they know they meet us in one place. But if the majority of those patients are now ending up in jail, now the people are trying to figure out what places are police not harassing them.\u201d",
      "Another challenge is fighting the common sentiment that providing services actually increases homelessness, Henderson said.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that ends homelessness is easy access to housing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that encourages people to be unsheltered. No one wants to be unsheltered. So by offering services like this, we\u2019re actually trying to ease people\u2019s suffering. When people come in here, they want to get off the street. They want to figure out a plan.\u201d",
      "Members of Miami Street Medicine have noticed more people losing their homes in recent years as prices increase and wages remain stagnant. Dr. Inaki Bent, who oversees street medicine teams, said he\u2019s also seen an increase in undocumented migrants on the streets as the state and federal governments have expanded immigration enforcement this year.",
      "\u201cI see patients here who are no longer working,\u201d Bent said. \u201cThey\u2019re no longer working because the fields and the construction sites have become targets. And they would prefer not to be employed or not to expose themselves to that risk.\u201d",
      "In addition to the individual benefit to patients, providing medical treatment on the street and at the group's clinic prevents treatable conditions from becoming emergencies that ultimately strain the entire health care system. For example, Bent had a patient who had previously been treated for seizures at an emergency room and received a prescription, but couldn't afford it. The patient would have eventually ended up back in the ER, but Miami Street Medicine paid for his medicine.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re able to fill that void and hopefully prevent a couple more admissions,\u201d Bent said. \u201cBut we're also able to do a human service for him, for our fellow man, to provide him with the necessary health care so he can begin his path toward a productive life.\u201d",

      "Husamettin Dogan, a 44-year-old construction worker, had been sentenced to nine years in prison in the first drugging-and-rape trial last year that riveted France and turned Pelicot into a global icon against sexual violence. The appeals jury was composed of three judges as well as ordinary citizens. The first trial that gave Dogan a lesser sentence was heard by five judges.",
      "The 50 other men convicted last December did not appeal the landmark verdict.

      "Dogan was tried on charges of aggravated rape by administering substances that impair judgment or self-control \u2014 an offense punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The prosecutor in the appeal case asked for a 12-year sentence, French media reported from the courthouse in Nimes, southern France.",
      "\"One cannot, in 2025, think that because she said nothing, that she agreed. Because that kind of thinking belongs to another era!\u201d the prosecutor told the court, according to Le Monde newspaper.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has criticized how wealthy people live in a \u201cbubble of comfort and luxury\u201d while the poor suffer",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV criticized how the wealthy live in a \u201cbubble of comfort and luxury\u201d while poor people suffer on the margins, confirming in his first teaching document that he is in perfect lockstep with his predecessor Pope Francis on matters of social and economic injustice.",
      "The Vatican on Thursday released the document, entitled \u201cI have loved you,\u201d which Francis had begun to write in his final months but never finished. Leo, who was elected in May, credited Francis with the text, cited him repeatedly, but said he had made the document his own and signed it.",
      "The 100-page document traces the history of Christianity\u2019s constant concern for poor people, from Biblical citations and the teaching of church fathers to the preaching of recent popes about caring for migrants, prisoners and victims of human trafficking.",
      "Leo credits especially women\u2019s religious orders with carrying out God\u2019s mandate to care for the sick, feed the poor and welcome the stranger, and also praised lay-led popular movements advocating for land, housing and work for the society\u2019s most disadvantaged.",
      "The conclusion Leo draws is that the Catholic Church\u2019s \u201cpreferential option for the poor\u201d has existed from the start, is non-negotiable and is the very essence of what it means to be Christian. He calls for a renewed commitment to fixing the structural causes of poverty, while providing unquestioning charity to those who need it.",
      "\u201cWhen the church kneels beside a leper, a malnourished child or an anonymous dying person, she fulfills her deepest vocation: to love the Lord where he is most disfigured,\u201d Leo writes.",
      "Leo cites Francis frequently, including in some of the Argentine pope\u2019s most-quoted talking points about the global \u201ceconomy that kills\u201d and criticism of trickle down economics. Francis made those points from the very start of his pontificate in 2013, saying he wanted a \u201cchurch that is poor and for the poor.\u201d",
      "\u201cGod has a special place in his heart for those who are discriminated against and oppressed, and he asks us, his church, to make a decisive and radical choice in favor of the weakest,\u201d Leo writes.",
      "Echoing Francis, Leo rails against the \u201cillusion of happiness\u201d derived from accumulating wealth. \u201cThus, in a world where the poor are increasingly numerous, we paradoxically see the growth of a wealthy elite, living in a bubble of comfort and luxury, almost in another world compared to ordinary people.\u201d",
      "Francis\u2019 frequent criticism of capitalism angered many conservative and wealthy Catholics, especially in the United States, who accused the Argentine Jesuit of being a Marxist.",
      "In a recent interview, Leo said such misdirected criticism cannot be leveled against him. \u201cThe fact that I am American means, among other things, people can\u2019t say, like they did about Francis, \u2018he doesn\u2019t understand the United States, he just doesn\u2019t see what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d Leo told Crux, a Catholic site.",
      "As a result, Leo\u2019s embrace of Francis\u2019 teaching on poverty and the church\u2019s obligation to care for the weakest is a significant reaffirmation, especially in Leo\u2019s first teaching document.",
      "Vatican officials insisted that the text was fully Leo\u2019s and declined to say how much Francis had written before he died.",

      "\u201cIt's 100% Francis and it's 100% Leo,\u201d said Cardinal Michael Czerny, who runs the Vatican's development and migrants office and was a top Francis aide. Asked if the same conservatives who labeled Francis a Marxist or Communist will now accuse Leo of the same, Czerny noted that both are merely following the Gospel.",
      "Such labels \u201csay much more about the person who is using the label,\u201d Czerny said. \u201cThe problem is not Pope Francis\u2019 or Pope Leo\u2019s. The problem is the person,\u201d using such labels to reject the church's teaching.",
      "Francis\u2019 spirit was very much infused in the document and in its official presentation on Thursday.",
      "In addition to Czerny, the news conference featured a rare appearance by Cardinal Konrad Krajewski, the Polish prelate whom Francis entrusted with carrying out his personal acts of charity over the course of his pontificate. Under Krajewski's quiet eye, the Vatican installed showers for homeless people off St. Peter\u2019s Square, provided COVID-19 vaccines for 6,000 migrants and people without access to Italy's health service, sent ambulances with medicine to Ukraine and hosted weekly luncheons for the hungry.",
      "Krajewski said the document was proof that such gestures of charity toward the needy come straight from the Bible, recalling that Jesus didn't work 9-5 in an office, but rather went out and looked for people who needed him.",
      "Krajewski regaled reporters with anecdotes of his behind-the-scenes dealings with Francis, who would jokingly reprimand him if his bank account had too much money in it because it meant he hadn't spent enough on poor people.",
      "Leo signed the text on Oct. 4, the feast of St. Francis of Assisi, the 13th-century mendicant friar who renounced his wealth to live poor among the poor. The date was not coincidental.",
      "The late Pope Francis named himself after the saint and one of the pontiff\u2019s most important documents \u2014 \u201cFratelli Tutti\u201d (Brothers All) \u2014 was itself published on the Oct. 4 feast day in 2020.",
      "Leo, too, seems inspired by the saint\u2019s example: As a young priest, the former Robert Prevost left the comforts of home to work as a missionary in Peru as a member of the Augustinian religious order, one of the other ancient mendicant orders that considers community, the sharing of communal property and service to others as central tenets of its spirituality.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some dismiss or ridicule charitable works, as if they were an obsession on the part of a few and not the burning heart of the church\u2019s mission, convinces me of the need to go back and reread the Gospel, lest we risk replacing it with the wisdom of this world,\u201d Leo writes.",

      "In 2013, mired in debt, Detroit filed for bankruptcy",
      "DETROIT -- DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Before the arrival of sprawling suburban malls featuring amusement park rides and stores peddling anything from jeans to jelly beans, there was Hudson's in downtown Detroit.",
      "The towering department store mirrored the growth and opulence of the auto-manufacturing town, but its fortunes \u2014 like the city\u2019s \u2014 soured with population shifts and economic downturns.",
      "In 1998, more than a century after J.L. Hudson's Co. opened shop, the 25-story building was demolished, leaving \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 a deep hole as a reminder of what Detroit used to be.",
      "Until this year.",
      "Standing on the Woodward Avenue site are a gleaming 45-story tower and a 12-story office building. The new 1.5 million-square-foot (140,000-square-meter) Hudson's Detroit development also contains retail space and will feature high-end condos. General Motors Corp. is relocating its headquarters there and a five-star hotel is slated to open in 2027.",
      "\u201cPeople are saying this isn\u2019t your father\u2019s or grandfather\u2019s Detroit anymore,\" said Dan Gilbert, whose property management company Bedrock developed the $1.5 billion construction. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to look at the numbers. You can just feel it walking around \u2014 you\u2019re going to feel a different Detroit.\u201d",
      "The old Hudson's building commanded attention and demanded respect, according to Jeremy Dimick, director of collections at the Detroit Historical Society. The new one is just as impressive. Its tower rises 685 feet (210 meters) over downtown Detroit.",
      "Its arrival is the latest chapter in the city's recovery.",
      "Mired in debt, Detroit once struggled to pay its bills and keep the streetlights on. It filed for bankruptcy in 2013, when its credit rating was at junk bond status.",
      "The city emerged from bankruptcy in 2014, built up a general fund balance of more than $1 billion, and has since recorded 10 consecutive years of budget surpluses. Moody\u2019s Investment Services gave Detroit its 11th consecutive credit rating upgrade this year and named the Hudson's development in its report.",
      "\u201cYou feel the energy when you\u2019re walking downtown,\u201d said Gilbert, whose company, Bedrock, owns more than 100 properties in downtown Detroit. \u201cThere\u2019s been just significant change.\"",
      "Launched in Detroit in 1881, the J.L. Hudson store initially specialized in clothing for men and boys. After occupying various downtown spaces, it set up shop at the Woodward Avenue site a decade later and expanded its wares, according to the Detroit Historical Society.",
      "The building grew over the years. About a dozen of its eventual 25 stories were used as retail space in what was considered the world's tallest department store for more than half a century.",
      "Dimick called it a Detroit institution.",
      "\u201cThat was the reason to go downtown,\u201d he said. \"It had been around so long that it became this multigenerational experience of shopping. \u2018I went there with my parents and I\u2019m going to take my children.'\"",
      "The grand department store offered fine linen, tableware and kitchen appliances. Factory workers could find overalls there. But most of all, Hudson's provided holiday magic.",
      "Bedecked in color, sounds and excitement, it was the center of downtown festivities. Thousands of shoppers entered the store every day, moving from department to department on escalators and in elevators. The longest line was of children waiting to sit on Santa's lap and whisper wishes of gifts.",

      "\u201cIt will feel like back in the day,\u201d he said.",
      "It was a grand and exciting time to be a Detroiter until \u2014 like many big manufacturing hubs \u2014 the city began to change. New freeways were built. Middle- and upper-class families left the city for new suburban homes with big yards.",
      "In the mid-1950s, Northland Center \u2014 then the largest mall in the U.S. \u2014 opened just north of Detroit, providing more options for suburban shoppers.",

      "The old Hudson\u2019s building downsized and eventually closed in 1983. It was imploded into a hulking mound of rubble, stone, steel and dust on Oct. 24, 1998.",

      "Gilbert, 63, says it will take decades to get a return on his Hudson's investment, but that isn't the point of the development.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this for ourselves,\" the fourth-generation Detroiter said, \"but we\u2019re also doing it for the city.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney raised the prospect of reviving the contentious Keystone XL pipeline project with U.S. President Donald Trump during his White House visit this week, a government official familiar with the matter said Wednesday.",
      "A Canadian company pulled the plug on it four years ago after the Canadian government failed to persuade then-President Joe Biden to reverse his cancellation of its permit on the day he took office. It was to transport crude from the oil sand fields of western Canada to Steele City, Nebraska.",
      "Trump previously revived the long-delayed project during his first term after it had stalled under the Obama administration. It would have moved up to 830,000 barrels (35 million gallons) of crude daily, connecting in Nebraska to other pipelines that feed oil refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast.",
      "The Canadian government official said Trump was receptive to the idea when it was talked about during their White House meeting Wednesday. The official said Carney linked energy cooperation to Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum sectors, which is subject to 50% U.S. tariffs.

But it would be a brilliant judo move to find common ground with the Trump Administration, and help him to realize that the US benefits from and needs its privileged relationship to Canada, and access to our resources,\u201d Kenney posted on social media.",

      "The federal government shutdown has entered its second week, and already shortages of air traffic controllers have strained operations and disrupted flights at some U.S. airports.",
      "Reagan National Airport became the latest this week to report delays because of staffing issues on Wednesday. But earlier in the week there were also problems at airports in Chicago, Newark, Denver and Nashville, and the tower even had to shut down for several hours in Burbank, California.",
      "Experts, as well as union leaders representing air traffic controllers and security screeners, warn that the impact could grow significantly worse if the shutdown continues and employees start to miss paychecks.",
      "Here is what to know about your rights as a passenger and what you can do if delays and cancellations start piling up:",
      "It is better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than to be stranded in an airport terminal, so use the airline\u2019s app or flight websites to make sure that your flight is still on before heading to the airport. This FAA site can be checked to see if there are widespread delays at your airport.",
      "Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, suggests also closely monitoring the news if you have upcoming travel plans.",
      "\u201cA deal, in theory, could come through Congress any day now, and that could put all of this doubt lingering over air travel to an end pretty quickly,\u201d Potter said.",
      "If you are already at the airport, it is time to find another flight. Get in line to speak to a customer service representative, and call or go online to connect to the airline\u2019s reservations staff. It also helps to reach out on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, because airlines might respond quickly there.",
      "Airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. The good news right now is that this is not a peak travel time, so travelers stand a better chance of finding seats. But the busy holiday season is right around the corner, and at those peak times, passengers might have to wait days for a seat on a new flight.",
      "If these problems do become more widespread, you might consider whether it makes sense to travel by train, car or bus instead. But there is really no way to predict when and where a staff shortage might happen, and the ongoing shortage of controllers is so critical that even a small number of absences can cause problems.",
      "Potter said the shutdown is different from when a single airline is having problems and travelers can just pick another carrier. This is creating problems for entire airports at once.",
      "\u201cAs these problems expand and spread the longer the shutdown drags on, it\u2019s unlikely that there will be one airline running on time if the rest of the them are failing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect the entire system over time.\u201d",
      "You can, but airlines aren\u2019t required to put you on another carrier\u2019s flight. Some airlines, including the biggest ones except Southwest and the discount airlines, say they can put you on a partner airline. But even then it is often hit or miss.",

      "\"If the airline cancels your flight, you can say, \u2018Alright. I will take a refund and get my money back,\u2019 \u201d Potter said. \u201cThe important piece is that you get your payment returned to you.

      "U.S. airlines are not required to pay additional cash compensation and cover lodging and meals for passengers who are stranded, even if a flight cancellation or a severe delay is the airline\u2019s fault.",
      "The Biden administration had proposed a rule that would have changed that and required airlines to pay passengers for delays and cancellations in more circumstances, with compensation proposed between about $200 and as high as $775. But the Trump administration scrapped that last month, and the airlines praised him for doing so.",
      "Each airline is different. The U.S. Department of Transportation has a site that lets consumers see the commitments that each carrier makes for refunds and covering other expenses when flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "Travel insurance might help if you bought a policy when you booked or used a travel credit card that offers that product, but Potter said you shouldn\u2019t assume you will be covered even if you have insurance. Check the fine print to see if you are covered in situations like this when a shortage of workers causes flight disruptions.",

      "The Senate voted 51-47 along party lines to confirm Panuccio and more than 100 other Trump nominees under rules adopted by Republicans to make it easier to confirm large groups of lower-level, non-judicial nominations.",
      "Leading Democratic senators have said they won\u2019t confirm Trump\u2019s nominees to the EEOC unless he reverses his unprecedented firing in January of two Democratic commissioners before their terms were up, saying the move stripped the agency of its historic bipartisanship and independence.",
      "Their dismissals removed a key obstacle to implementing Trump's civil rights agenda but also temporarily left the commission without the quorum required to bring some major lawsuits, revise regulations for implementing laws and take other decisions.",
      "Republican senators have welcomed the prospect that the EEOC will rescind certain policies on DEI, gender-identity and abortion that they argued overstepped the agency's authority.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who was confirmed to a second term as commissioner in July, has taken key steps to fulfill a slew of Trump's executive orders on civil rights.",
      "The EEOC has dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers and subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny. The agency also stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d an established concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out certain practices that disadvantage minorities, women, people with disabilities, older adults, and others. Lucas leveraged the EEOC to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",
      "The EEOC, which investigates employment discrimination in the private sector, was created by Congress under the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The president appoints its five commissioners and the Senate confirms them, but their terms are meant to be staggered and overlap presidential terms.",
      "Panuccio was nominated to replace Republican Keith Sonderling, who left the EEOC in 2024 and is now deputy labor secretary. The EEOC now has three commissioners, including Democrat Kalpana Kotagal. Trump has yet to announce nominations for the two remaining vacancies. Meanwhile, one of the two Democratic commissioners he fired, Jocelyn Samuels, has filed a lawsuit demanding to be reinstated.",
      "At their Senate hearings, both Lucas and Panuccio vehemently maintained that the EEOC should not be considered an independency agency.",

      "But during an exchange with Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Panuccio refused to rule out the possibility that the EEOC would obey a hypothetical order from Trump to stop investigating sex-based discrimination charges on behalf of women, answering that that \u201cthe EEOC as an executive branch agency does respond to the President as the head of the executive branch.\u201d",
      "While the EEOC has continued bringing lawsuits and settling complaints on behalf of women, Democrats and civil rights groups say the EEOC has set a dangerous precedent of halting investigations into entire categories of discrimination to comply with presidential orders.",

      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) \u2014 Kentucky's attorney general claimed Tuesday that the online gaming platform Roblox has become a \u201cplayground for predators\u201d as he announced a lawsuit accusing the company of lax child safety measures.",
      "The Kentucky suit, filed by his office Monday in a state court, is the latest action alleging that the wildly popular site isn\u2019t doing enough to protect children on its gaming services.",
      "To bolster safeguards for children and teenagers flocking to the site, the company needs to install effective age verifications and content filters, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said. Added parental notifications also are needed, he said.",
      "Courtney Norris, a Kentucky mother of three who joined Coleman at a news conference, said she mistakenly viewed Roblox as a safe online gaming choice for her children.",
      "\"I came to realize, later than I would like to admit, that it actually is the \u2018Wild West\u2019 of the internet, targeted at children,\u201d she said.",
      "The company is facing a growing backlash. The Kentucky suit comes after Louisiana sued the company in August. A suit was filed in Iowa after a 13-year-old girl was allegedly introduced to an adult predator on the platform, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped.",
      "Roblox on Tuesday pushed back against the allegations.",
      "\u201cWe have rigorous safety measures in place from advanced AI models to an expertly trained team of thousands moderating our platform 24/7 for inappropriate content,\u201d the company said in a statement. \"No system is perfect and our work on safety is never done. We are constantly innovating our safety systems, including adding 100 new safeguards, such as facial age estimation, this year alone.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it has 111 million daily active users. The company said in an email Tuesday that it implements strict safety defaults for its youngest users. It said the platform's users under 13 cannot directly message others on Roblox, outside of games or experiences, and cannot directly message others during games or experiences unless the default setting is changed using parental controls.",
      "The company said it has rigorous text chat filters to block inappropriate words and phrases, attempts to direct under-13 users off the platform and the sharing of personal information such as phone number or address. It does not allow user-to-user image sharing and prohibits sexual conversations, it said.",
      "The Kentucky lawsuit gives a starkly different portrayal of the platform.",

      "Francine the calico cat is back home at a Lowe's store in Virginia after going missing for a few weeks, hitching a ride on a truck that turned up at a sister facility in another state.",
      "Two employees from a Lowe\u2019s in Richmond made the 90-minute drive early Monday to pick up Francine, who disappeared in September and recently was discovered at the company\u2019s distribution center in Garysburg, North Carolina.",
      "She was back on the job Tuesday, playing with customers, posing for photos and soaking in affection.",
      "\u201cFrancine is one of us,\" store supervisor Wayne Schneider said in a telephone interview. \"She\u2019s just amazing. What she means here to the store and the employees, you really can\u2019t imagine the outpouring that the employees and also the customers give her daily.\u201d",
      "Francine spends much of her time either at the customer service desk or in the store's seasonal area. But things went awry in September as the store brought in items for the upcoming Christmas season. Store general manager Mike Sida said that disruption may have prompted Francine to seek comfort elsewhere.",
      "After store employees hadn't seen Francine for a few days, they reviewed past surveillance video. There were glimpses of her in the appliance section and then the receiving department, where she darted into a truck. An overnight manager is then seen shutting the truck's door and off it went to Garysburg, about 85 miles (137 kilometers) to the south.",
      "\u201cAnd then, of course, when she got down to the distribution center, she shot off the truck,\u201d Sida said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we found out where she was and she was missing.\u201d",
      "An animal control office set up humane traps at the distribution center, where photos of Francine were posted throughout. The center had dozens of monitoring cameras, and Lowe\u2019s brought in thermal drones to survey the area. An Instagram account unaffiliated with Lowe's dedicated to finding Francine grew to more than 34,000 followers.",
      "On Saturday, Francine was spotted on camera near the distribution center. After more humane traps were installed, a volunteer checked each trap throughout the night. Finally, one of the traps triggered and Francine's meows could be heard.",
      "Schneider and Sida got in a car early Monday and drove to get Francine.",
      "\u201cThat ride going down, knowing that we were going to get her, was just heartwarming. Knowing she\u2019s safe and that she\u2019s coming back to the store to get off her two-week vacation,\u201d Schneider said.",

In New York City, cats are beloved fixtures of the city\u2019s bodegas and delis.",

After reaching a new quota of 18.3 million tons of imports, additional imports will face a 50% tariff. This is double the current 25% rate \u2014 a high price akin to U.S. President Donald Trump's steel measures. Neighboring nations such as Norway, Iceland and Ukraine will be exempt.",

      "The spring 2026 season has wrapped up with Paris, showcasing bold trends that are set to influence global fashion",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 The spring fashion season ended with silhouettes you could spot from a block away.",
      "As Paris Fashion Week wrapped up this week after myriad debuts and shake-ups, three trends took hold. Shoulders were broadened and jackets snapped to attention. Skin showed on the wearer\u2019s terms. And dressy, formal fashion came back \u2014 lighter, simpler, and meant for real life, not just red carpets.",
      "Call it Paris \u2019 no-nonsense reply to a jittery year: clothes that square your shoulders, put you in charge of your body and add walk-in impact to any weekday at work.",
      "Because the French capital remains the ultimate fashion gateway and the city that closes the season, trends seen here will rapidly cascade to high streets in New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo and beyond.",
      "Celebrity isn\u2019t new to fashion \u2014 but its pull is growing, and this season it felt central once again.",
      "Meghan Markle at Balenciaga, Madonna gracing Saint Laurent, Kim Kardashian sweeping into Maison Margiela, Nicole Kidman front-row at Chanel.",
      "The star arrivals turned shows into broadcast moments before the first look. Designers responded accordingly.",
      "This week\u2019s shows underlined the impact of the digital age. Celebrity-driven fashion shows now reach a global audience online, so designs must look great both in person and on camera. The most successful looks are those that impress live and also stand out in quick, eye-catching clips.",
      "The first and loudest shift was power up top. Jackets broadened the shoulder and cleaned up the line.",
      "Saint Laurent set the mood in razor-shouldered black. Mugler revived the hourglass with no apology. Givenchy eased the padding but kept the authority. Celine offered the daily uniform in crisp blazers and trousers.",
      "Even Chanel \u2014 a house that can tilt ornate \u2014 lightened the suit and cropped the jacket so it moved. The message is simple: after seasons of slouch, tailoring is back.",

      "Sheer looks were finished, not flimsy. Givenchy\u2019s transparency read as strength. Dior\u2019s lace felt airy, not uptight. Saint Laurent\u2019s clingy layers made openness the point. Low waists returned with a steadier hand: McQueen brought back the low-rise line without the old shock factor.",
      "Even the \u201cproper\u201d houses joined in \u2014 Chanel nodded to underwear roots, and Herm\u00e8s traced equestrian lines into the city. The fight over where the waist sits is back, but the choice belongs to the wearer.",
      "Dressy, formal fashion came back \u2014 lighter, simpler, and built for real life, not just red carpets. Paris remembered how to do drama without dead weight.",
      "Balenciaga floated a clean, sculpted volume that photographed big but wore light. Valentino dialed back ornament and let color and cut carry the room. Westwood kept the riotous spirit but cut it to move. Louis Vuitton scaled grandeur to everyday life. The cape stepped off the costume rack and into daylight at Dior \u2014 easy to wear, easy to fit, instant drama.",
      "Feathers followed suit across houses \u2014 glamorous, yes, but designed to walk. Dress-up isn\u2019t dead. It just punched a time card.",
      "In Milan, Bottega Veneta\u2019s Louise Trotter turned the house\u2019s craft into motion, showcasing sleek intrecciato outerwear and shimmering knits that backed the season\u2019s bigger-shoulder, lighter-feel mood. And at Versace, new creative lead Dario Vitale brought the brand down from Olympus to everyday \u2014 sexy, a little undone, and cut to live in, not just pose.",
      "Craft met tech quietly, resulting in fabrics that looked richer but felt lighter. Bags got more practical. These pieces don\u2019t want a glass case, they want scuffs and repeat wears. From New York, Michael Kors pushed the same idea of ease for a warming world \u2014 travel-minded, desert-light layers that breathe and move instead of cling.",
      "Color spoke plainly, too. Black led \u2014 it framed the big shoulder and sharpened the new suiting \u2014 with bright exceptions used like highlighters rather than paint buckets. You\u2019ll see the dark stuff first on the street, then the jewel tones. And the American minimalism test applied: strip the extras and let the shape do the work \u2014 a Calvin Klein lesson that echoed across runways.",
      "If one caption fits the week, Rick Owens supplied it when he sent models wading through water and made a case for tenacity in uncomfortable times. Paris took him at his word.",
      "The best looks didn\u2019t chase viral moments; they did a job. A strong jacket that squares your posture. A sheer dress that doesn\u2019t blink. A cape that turns a commute into an entrance. Three trends, plain as day \u2014 big shoulders, real skin, and dress-up with a day job \u2014 and a fashion capital reminding everyone that bold and useful can be the same thing.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for public television stations suffering from cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \u201cdedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\u201d said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \u201cThis auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\u201d",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \u201cThe Best of Joy of Painting,\u201d based on Ross' show, \u201cAmerica's Test Kitchen,\u201d \u201cJulia Child's French Chef Classics\u201d and \u201cThis Old House.\u201d Small and rural stations are particularly challenged.",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources. Many launched emergency fund drives. Some have been forced to lay off staff and make programming cuts.",

      "The beloved Ross died in 1995 of complications from cancer after 11 years in production with \u201cThe Joy of Painting.\u201d His how-to program was shown on stations around the U.S. and around the world. The former Air Force drill sergeant known for his calm demeanor and encouraging words enjoyed a resurgence in popularity during the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Ross spoke often as he worked on air about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \u201chappy accidents.\u201d",
      "The thirty paintings to be auctioned span Ross\u2019 career and include landscapes depicting serene mountain vistas and lake scenes, his signature aesthetic. He created most of the 30 on-air, each in under 30 minutes, which was the span of a single episode.",
      "Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750. The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Aaron Judge walked slowly from first base to the Yankees' dugout after Cody Bellinger ended the game with a strikeout, then turned his head to watch the Toronto Blue Jays celebrate on New York's infield.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t like seeing it and it kind of leaves an impression,\u201d Judge said. \u201cMake sure this doesn\u2019t happen next year.\u201d",
      "New York's 16th consecutive season without a World Series championship ended Wednesday night with a 5-2 loss to Toronto, which won the AL Division Series 3-1 and advanced to a matchup against Seattle or Detroit for the American League pennant.",
      "An hour after the game, Giancarlo Stanton walked over to Judge, seated by his locker in the quiet clubhouse, and put a consoling arm around the captain's shoulder.",

      "Judge hit .500 with seven RBIs in seven postseason games, including .600 (9 for 15) with one homer, six RBIs, four walks and a 1.617 OPS against the Blue Jays. But a year after losing a five-game World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Yankees are still looking for championship No. 28.",
      "\u201cThis has been a tough year for me personally,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said after his eighth season without a title. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible. It hurts.\u201d",
      "Now 33 and perhaps on the verge of his third AL MVP award, Judge has had eight unfulfilling trips to the playoffs in 10 big league seasons.",
      "Instead of moving alongside Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle and Derek Jeter in adding to the Yankees\u2019 championship collection, Judge remains in the same category as Don Mattingly and Dave Winfield \u2014 star players also known for not winning a World Series in the Bronx.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going to happen, and he and I wholeheartedly believe that it will,\u201d Boone said. \u201cYou keep working your tail off to get back to this position and punch through.\u201d",
      "Judge won his first AL batting title this season by hitting .331 with 114 RBIs and 53 home runs \u2014 reaching 50 for the fourth time. He is on a Hall of Fame track with a .294 career average and 368 homers, and he has a .235 postseason average with 17 homers and 41 RBIs in 65 games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like we take it for granted because he only had 50-something homers and not 60,\" said Paul Goldschmidt, a seven-time All-Star who joined the Yankees for this season. \u201cTook it to a whole new level. He\u2019s the best that I\u2019ve ever been around. He\u2019s also just the greatest teammate I\u2019ve been around, the best leader.\u201d",

      "A year after an AL East title and a five-game World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Yankees had a winning record for the 33rd straight season.

      "And just like last year, defense precipitated the demise. Second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr. allowed Andr\u00e9s Gim\u00e9nez's hard one-hopper to skip off his glove for an error instead of turning it into an inning-ending double play, and Nathan Lukes hit a two-out, two-run single off Devin Williams for a 4-1 lead in the seventh.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After taking down the storied New York Yankees in their own ballpark, Toronto manager John Schneider was ready to revel in the triumph.",
      "\u201cStart spreading the news!\u201d Schneider exclaimed while popping a bottle of bubbly to set off the Blue Jays' jubilant celebration inside their Yankee Stadium clubhouse Wednesday night.",
      "With the party underway, those familiar lyrics from Frank Sinatra's version of \u201cNew York, New York\u201d \u2014 the Yankees' longtime victory anthem \u2014 sounded in the background as roaring Toronto players sprayed each other with booze in the Bronx.",
      "This time, it was their time.",
      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and George Springer each drove in a run, and eight Toronto pitchers shut down the Yankees in a 5-2 victory that sent the Blue Jays to the American League Championship Series for the first time in nine years.",
      "\u201cKind of fitting that it took everyone to win today,\u201d said Schneider, his hair and T-shirt soaked.",

      "Those teams are set to decide their playoff series Friday in Game 5 at Seattle.",
      "\u201cIt feels great,\u201d Guerrero said through a translator. \u201cEverybody was just together since the first day. You could tell that something special was there.\u201d",
      "Guerrero was something special himself. The $500 million slugger batted .529 with three homers and nine RBIs in the ALDS, tormenting the Yankees in October in the mold of David Ortiz, Ken Griffey Jr. and George Brett decades ago.",
      "Jeff Hoffman retired Austin Wells with the bases loaded to end the eighth inning and got four outs for his first postseason save, advancing the worst-to-first Blue Jays to their eighth AL Championship Series.",
      "Toronto's only pennants came in 1992 and '93, when the club won consecutive World Series crowns. A season ago, the Blue Jays finished last in the AL East at 74-88.",
      "\u201cMaybe some people don\u2019t believe in the team through the year, but I always remind everyone that we have an entire country behind us that believe in us, and hopefully we can get the World Series back to Canada,\u201d Guerrero said.",
      "Ryan McMahon homered and Aaron Judge had an RBI single for the wild-card Yankees, unable to stave off elimination for a fourth time this postseason as they failed to repeat as AL champions.",
      "Despite a terrific playoff performance from Judge following his previous October troubles, the 33-year-old superstar and team captain remains without a World Series ring. New York is still chasing its 28th title and first since 2009.",
      "\u201cWe got beat here. Credit to the Blue Jays,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cThey took it to us this series.\u201d",

      "The NBA is returning to China with preseason games between the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns in Macao",
      "The last time the NBA went to China, there was silence. They were two of the most awkward games probably ever played, a pair of preseason matchups between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers with some fans barely reacting to anything and no press conferences held afterward.",
      "This time, it's going to be very different. Back to normal, it would seem.",
      "The Nets and Phoenix Suns have made their way to the Chinese gambling hub of Macao for two preseason games \u2014 one Friday, the other on Sunday, and marking the NBA's first games played in China since 2019. There are two more games planned for next season in China as well.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important for us to be able to bring the live game experience, including live games, to as many fans of the NBA around the world,\" NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum said. \"And there\u2019s no doubt that China has one of the largest fanbases in the world \u2014 hundreds of millions of fans in China, 300 million people play the game of basketball in China, and our mission is to inspire and connect people everywhere through the game of basketball.\u201d",
      "There was a time where it seemed uncertain if that connecting would still be possible.",
      "A geopolitical rift was sparked by a tweet posted by Daryl Morey \u2014 then the general manager of the Houston Rockets, now of the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 that was in support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. China severed most ties with the NBA for some time, taking games off its broadcast channels, and the process of mending at least some fences took years.",
      "Even now, the games come at a turbulent time. There is trade friction between the U.S. and China, with both sides threatening sky-high tariffs on the others' exports. And the NBA has long heard criticisms from lawmakers \u2014 on both sides of the aisle \u2014 about not taking a stronger public stance about China\u2019s human rights record.",
      "\u201cMuch of the sports industry is based on relationships and we think sports plays a unique role in building community \u2014 not just in the United States but around the world and particularly at times of heightened division,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cWhether that division is domestically or globally there\u2019s almost nothing else I can think of that brings together communities like sports does, and particularly a sport like basketball that is globally played, globally understood.\u201d",
      "The Nets and Suns will play at Macao\u2019s Venetian Arena, which is owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corp. \u2014 which is a casino operator there as well. Sands president and chief operating officer Patrick Dumont is governor of the Dallas Mavericks, assuming that role after his family acquired the team.",
      "\u201cObviously, we know this is great for the Phoenix Suns and our community, our whole organization and the NBA,\u201d Suns coach Jordan Ott said.",
      "The Nets are owned by Joe Tsai, the chairman of Chinese tech giant Alibaba. And this NBA season comes with high hopes for a Chinese rookie: Yang Hansen, a 7-foot-1 draft pick who is expected to play a role for the Portland Trail Blazers this season.",
      "He's thrilled that the NBA is headed back there, finally.",
      "\u201cI want to say firstly, playing for the Blazers is a wonderful thing for me, and I wish that I can take all the players and management and coaches to China for sure in the future,\u201d Yang said with the support of an interpreter. \u201cFor sure, I wish (for) more games in China. ... That works for me perfectly. I just wish that in the future, we can have it \u2014 I can also play in front of all my homies, which is also the proudest thing for me.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.",
      "The probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.",

      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \u201csummon\u201d technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

The new business plan calls for more models with lower volumes of each.",

      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 iPhone users have a new tool to combat the scourge of nuisance phone calls: a virtual gatekeeper that can screen incoming calls from unknown numbers.",
      "It's among the bevy of new features that Apple rolled out with last month's release of iOS 26. The screening feature has been getting attention because of the ever-increasing amount of robocalls and spam calls that leave many phone users feeling harassed.",
      "Here's a run-through of the new function:",
      "First, you'll need to update your iPhone's operating system to iOS 26, which is available to the iPhone 11 and newer models.",
      "To switch call screening on, go into Settings--Apps\u2014Phone. Scroll down and you'll find a new option: Screen Unknown Callers.",
      "You'll be presented with three choices. The Never option lets any unknown call ring through, while Silence sends all unidentified numbers directly to voicemail. What you want to tap is the middle option: Ask Reason for Calling.",
      "If the option isn't there, try restarting your phone.",
      "I still couldn't find it after updating to iOS 26, but, after some online sleuthing, I checked my region and language settings because I saw some online commenters reporting they had to match. It turns out my region was still set to Hong Kong, where I lived years ago. I switched it to the United Kingdom, which seemed to do the trick and gave me the updated menu.",
      "Call screening introduces a layer between you and new callers.",
      "When someone who's not in your contacts list dials your number, a Siri-style voice will ask them to give their name and the purpose of their call.",
      "At the same time, you'll get a notification that the call is being screened. When the caller responds, the answers will be transcribed and the conversation will pop up in speech bubbles.",
      "You can then answer the call.",
      "Don't want to answer? Send a reply by tapping one of the pre-written messages, such as \u201cI'll call you later\u201d or \u201cSend more information,\u201d which the AI voice will read out to the caller.",
      "Or you can type out your own message for the computer-generated voice to read out.",
      "If you don't respond right away, the phone will continue to ring while you decide what to do.",
      "In theory, call screening is a handy third way between the nuclear option of silencing all unknown callers \u2014 including legitimate ones \u2014 or letting them all through.",

      "\u201cBubbles obviously are never very easy to identify, but we can see there are a few potential symptoms of a bubble in the current situation,\u201d said Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics.",
      "Those symptoms include rapid growth in tech stock prices, the fact that tech stocks now comprise about 40% of the S&P 500, market valuations that appear \u201cstretched\u201d beyond their worth and \u201ca general sense of extreme optimism in terms of the underlying technology, despite the enormous uncertainties around what this technology might ultimately yield,\u201d Slater said.",
      "The most optimistic projections about the fruits of generative AI products foresee a transformation of the economy, leading to annual productivity gains that Slater says have not been seen since the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. At the lower end, economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has predicted a \u201cnontrivial but modest\u201d U.S. productivity gain of just 0.7% over a decade.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this incredibly wide range of possibilities,\u201d Slater said. \u201cNobody really knows where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d",

      "The Bank of England didn't name any specific companies but said that on \u201ca number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence.\u201d",
      "The report said stock market valuations are \u201ccomparable to the peak\u201d of the 2000 dotcom bubble, which then deflated and led to a recession. With tech stocks accounting for an increasingly large share of benchmark stock indexes, stock markets are \u201cparticularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.\u201d",
      "The bank outlined so-called downside risks, including shortages of electricity, data or chips that could slow AI progress, or technological changes that could lessen the need for the type of AI infrastructure currently being built around the world.",
      "The IMF's Georgieva said current stock valuations \u201care heading toward levels we saw during the bullishness about the internet 25 years ago. If a sharp correction were to occur, tighter financial conditions could drag down world growth,\u201d she said.",

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to protect Google from a year-old order requiring a major makeover of its Android app store that's designed to unleash more competition against a system that a jury declared an illegal monopoly.",
      "The rebuff delivered in a one-sentence decision by the Supreme Court means Google will soon have to start an overhaul of its Play Store for the apps running on the Android software that powers most smartphones that compete against Apple's iPhone in the U.S.",
      "Among other changes, U.S. District Judge James Donato last October ordered Google to give its competitors access to its entire inventory of Android apps and also make those alternative options available to download from the Play Store.",
      "In a filing last month, Google told the U.S. Supreme Court that Donato's order would expose the Play Store's more than 100 million U.S. users to \u201cenormous security and safety risks by enabling stores that stock malicious, deceptive, or pirated content to proliferate.\"",
      "Google also said it faced an Oct. 22 deadline to begin complying with the judge's order if the Supreme Court didn't grant its request for a stay. The Mountain View, California, company was seeking the protection while pursuing a last-ditch attempt to overturn the December 2023 jury verdict that condemned the Play Store as an abusive monopoly.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will continue its fight in the Supreme Court while submitting to what it believes is a problematic order. \u201cThe changes ordered by the U.S. District Court will jeopardize users\u2019 ability to safely download apps,\u201d Google warned.",
      "Google had been insulated from the order while trying to overturn it and the monopoly verdict, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected that attempt in a decision issued two months ago.",
      "In its filing with the Supreme Court, Google argued it was being unfairly turned into a supplier and distributor for would-be rivals.",
      "Donato concluded the digital walls shielding the Play Store from competition needed to be torn down to counteract a pattern of abusive behavior. The conduct had enabled Google to to reap billions of dollars in annual profits, primarily from its exclusive control of a payment processing system that collected a 15-30% fee on in-app transactions.",

      "Epic, the maker of the Fortnite game, lost a similar antitrust case targeting Apple's iPhone app store. Even though U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers concluded the iPhone app store wasn't an illegal monopoly, she ordered Apple to begin allowing links to alternative payment systems as part of a shake-up that resulted in the company being held in civil contempt of court earlier this year.",

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) \u2014 FIFA is employing an alternative review system that allows coaches to appeal two referee\u2019s decisions per match at the Under-20 soccer World Cup in Chile",
      "The football video support (FVS) is a \u201csimplified version\u201d of VAR and has transformed the youth tournament into a testing ground for new technologies.",
      "Cards that vary between blue and purple are held by coaches, who are in charge of requesting reviews.",
      "During the group stage, its use has proven crucial, defining the course of several matches played in the cities of Santiago, Valpara\u00edso, Rancagua and Talca. The system was deployed in more than a dozen matches in the early part of the tournament.",
      "FVS was first used when South Korea coach Lee Chang-Won used a card for the first time during the opening match against Ukraine. He challenged a penalty, but the request was ultimately ruled out by the referee.",
      "Since then, the review system has had a role in several matches. Of the 12 games in the first round of the group stage, the \u201clight VAR\u201d was used in seven.",
      "It proved decisive in Norway\u2019s 1-0 victory over Nigeria after a review of a handball by Nigeria defender Ahmed Akinyele, which American referee Joe Dickerson had ignored.",
      "FVS also disallowed a goal in Argentina's 4-1 win against Australia \u2014 the review denying a tying goal for the Socceroos.",
      "Mexico's use of the system helped it overturn a penalty decision in a match they ended up tying 2-2 against Spain. It also led to Paraguay winger Enso Gonz\u00e1lez being red-carded after kicking South Korea striker Hyeon-oh Kim.",
      "Unlike VAR, which uses special cameras and a supporting team of officials, FVS referees review their decisions based on images captured by the television broadcast, without further assistance.",
      "According to world soccer's ruling body FIFA, the FVS system aims to \u201cdemocratize football by introducing video review technology as a complementary option,\u201d not only for top-level competitions but also for those that \u201ccould not afford VAR infrastructure,\u201d thanks to its low cost and simplified operation.",

      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",

      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \u201cMy phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: \u2018That\u2019s just, that\u2019s spam of some sort.'\u201d",

If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they\u2019re supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi\u2019s discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014 which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too",

      "Days later, NATO jets escorted three Russian warplanes out of Estonia\u2019s airspace.",

      "Minnesota regulators have approved the takeover of Minnesota Power by an investment group, despite opposition from the state attorney general and consumer advocates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- MINNEAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Minnesota regulators voted unanimously Friday to approve an investment group's takeover of a power company over the objections of the state attorney general, big industrial electricity buyers and consumer advocates.",
      "In voting for the takeover of Duluth-based Minnesota, the five members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission said they believe the conditions imposed on the deal will protect the public interest and shield customers from rate increases. Opponents warned that the private equity group is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers.",
      "The approval came as electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests the bills of some residential customers are increasing to subsidize the rapid build-out of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers and the boom in artificial intelligence.",
      "Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center in Minnesota Power\u2019s territory in the northern part of the state, a lucrative prospect for the utility's owner.",
      "Opponents also expressed fear that the sale would encourage more such deals across the U.S.",
      "Under the planned buyout, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board will take over the publicly traded company Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "The buyout price is $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium, and assuming $2.3 billion in debt. In its petition, Allete told regulators that Minnesota Power\u2019s operations, strategy and values wouldn\u2019t change under BlackRock and that the deal\u2019s cost wouldn't affect electric rates.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five of the utility commissioners, sided with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "The state Department of Commerce, Minnesota Power and the investors negotiated a package of modifications this summer that included additional financial and regulatory safeguards. The department's attorney, Richard Dornfeld, told the commission the changes will protect the public interest.",
      "The commission's chair, Katie Sieben, agreed.",
      "\u201cBecause of the collective work of partners, stakeholders, labor, environmental groups and others, we\u2019ve made the overall package better for Minnesota Power customers,\u201d Sieben said.",

      "Allete argued that BlackRock will have an easier time raising the money that Minnesota Power needs to comply with a state law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Previously, an administrative law judge recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence revealed the buyout group\u2019s \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2014 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "Commissioner Audrey Partridge said she started with \u201ca high degree of skepticism and I would say even cynicism,\u201d and \u201cassumed the absolute worst in these investors.\u201d But she said the added safeguards, and the over $100 million that the investors will provide for relief for ratepayers and investments in clean energy, will protect the public interest.",
      "Opponents said they were dismayed by the approval.",
      "\u201cPrivate equity ownership of Minnesota Power will likely mean higher bills, less accountability, and more risk for Minnesotans,\" Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said in a statement. The national nonprofit says it seeks to bring transparency and accountability to the private equity industry.",

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

If companies start making more money, they are either going to increase the dividend or invest in new areas. Hopefully, the majority will invest in new areas to create new jobs.",
      "You will see successful companies expand and grow dramatically, but you are probably going to see 50% of the Fortune 500 companies disappear and 50% of the executives of the Fortune 500 disappear. They won\u2019t have the skills to adjust to this new innovation economy driven by AI because they were trained in silos they were trained to move at the speed of a five-year cycle as opposed to a 12-month cycle.",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog thanked Trump \"for his incredible leadership.\"",
      "LONDON -- World leaders on Thursday issued a wave of statements commending Israel and Hamas for agreeing to the first phase of a ceasefire deal, with many also praising U.S. President Donald Trump for his administration\u2019s role in brokering the deal.",
      "\"I welcome the news that a deal has been reached on the first stage of President Trump\u2019s peace plan for Gaza,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement. \"This is a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world, but particularly for the hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years.\"",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres issued statements with wording closely matching Starmer\u2019s. Each praised Trump, then also included an appeal to Israel and Hamas to abide by the terms of the agreement.",
      "Those statements and many others like them followed Trump\u2019s announcement on Wednesday evening that the warring parties had \"both signed off\" on the first phase of a ceasefire plan.",
      "\"This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace. All Parties will be treated fairly!\" Trump said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "The full details of that deal were still coming into focus on Thursday, but the broad outline included a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release by Hamas of the remaining hostages, according to Trump. An as-yet unknown number of Palestinian prisoners are also expected to be released from Israeli jails. Nearly 2,000 prisoners are believed to be under discussion for release.",
      "Israeli officials were preparing on Thursday to ratify the deal. The details of the agreed-to deal had not been released as of Thursday morning.",
      "White House Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were in Egypt on Wednesday for the final negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in Washington, where he interrupted a White House roundtable to notify Trump that an agreement to the deal was near.",
      "The administration's efforts drew applause from Trump\u2019s allies in Washington, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who in a statement hailed it as \"a truly historic achievement,\" as well as from leaders and aid organisations farther afield.",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement posted on social media he wanted to thank \"all those involved in this vital effort.\"",
      "\"I wish to extend my deepest thanks to POTUS Donald Trump for his incredible leadership toward securing the release of the hostages, bringing an end to the war, and creating hope for a new reality in the Middle East,\" Herzog said. \"There is no doubt that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for this. Should he visit us in the coming days, he will be received with immense respect, affection, and gratitude by the people of Israel.\"",

      "Praise for the deal also came from the Palestinian Authority, which governed the Gaza Strip until a violent 2007 seizure by Hamas, the terror organization that at that time executed or expelled many of the Authority's civil leaders. The Authority, which currently controls civil operations in parts of the West Bank, said in a statement that President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed the deal, calling it a \"prelude to reaching a permanent political solution.\"",
      "\"He also commended President Trump and all mediators for their significant\u00a0efforts in reaching the agreement, affirming the State of Palestine's readiness to work with relevant mediators and international partners to ensure its success, in order to achieve stability and a lasting and just peace in accordance with international law,\" the Authority\u2019s statement said.",
      "Guterres, of the U.N., said on social media he welcomed the agreement, praising the \"diplomatic efforts\" of the United States and the others who moved the deal forward, including Qatar, Egypt and Turkey. He called it a \"desperately needed breakthrough.\"",
      "\"The UN will support the full implementation of the agreement & will scale up the delivery of sustained & principled humanitarian relief, and we will advance recovery & reconstruction efforts in Gaza,\" Guterres added.",
      "European Council President Antonio Costa said the deal amounted to a \"foundation for a lasting peace, grounded in a two-state solution.\"",
      "\"Its implementation paves the way for the long-awaited release of all Israeli hostages, a ceasefire in Gaza, and an end to the severe humanitarian crisis on the ground,\" Costa said on Thursday.",
      "The Catholic Church\u2019s local patriarchate also issued a statement praising the deal, saying it \"welcomes the joy\" of the announcement.",
      "\"It is good news, and we are very happy. It is a first step, the first phase. Of course, there are many others, and surely there will be other obstacles,\" Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, of the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, said in a statement.",
      "He added, \"But now we have to rejoice about this important step that will bring a little more trust for the future and also bring new hope, especially to the people, both Israeli and Palestinians.\"",

(AP) \u2014 Century-old wreaths made from human hair fill the walls of Leila\u2019s Hair Museum, and glass cases overflow with necklaces and watch bands woven from the locks of the dead. There also are tresses purported to come from past presidents, Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe and even Jesus.",
      "For about 30 years, this hair art collection in the Kansas City suburb of Independence attracted an eclectic group of gawkers that included the likes of heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne.",
      "But the museum's namesake, Leila Cohoon, died last November at the age of 92. Now her granddaughter, Lindsay Evans, is busy rehoming the collection of more than 3,000 pieces to museums across the country, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cEvery time I come here, I feel her here,\u201d Evans said Monday while touring with representatives of the National Museum of Funeral History in Houston who left with around 30 pieces. \u201cThis place is her. And so I feel like this process of rehoming her collection has helped me grieve her in a way that I didn\u2019t even realize I really needed.\u201d",
      "It all started in 1956 when Cohoon, a hair dresser, was shopping for Easter shoes. Inside an antique store she found a gold frame filled with strands of hair twisted into the shape of flowers.",
      "\u201cShe said forget the Easter shoes,\u201d Evans said. \u201cMy granddad always said that this was the most expensive piece of the museum because look at what it started.\u201d",

      "This form of art peaked in popularity in the mid-1800s as women coiled the hair of the dead into jewelry or told their family history by intertwining the curls of loved ones into wreaths.",
      "But hair art had fallen out of favor by the 1940s, as memories were captured in photos, Evans said. Additionally, \u201cthis artwork was not celebrated because it was mostly done by women. And so in larger museums, they don\u2019t have a lot of this.\u201d",
      "Her grandmother saved some from being trashed, wrote a book and taught classes on the art form, training a new generation of artists.",
      "Often the hair art was housed in elaborate frames with original glass, so when her grandmother started haggling with antique dealers for the frames, they frequently offered to get rid of the hair.",

      "The collection grew to include a wreath containing hair from every woman in the League of Women Voters from Vermont in 1865. A pair of crescent-shaped wreaths contain the tresses of two sisters whose heads were shaved when they entered a convent. A couple pieces even feature taxidermy.",
      "The frames filled the walls of her home and the beauty school she ran with her husband. She shoved them under beds and in closets. Eventually, the couple snatched up this building \u2014 a former car dealership \u2014 nestled between a fast-food restaurant and car wash.",
      "Celebrities caught wind of the attraction. Actress and comedian Phyllis Diller donated a hair wreath that had been in her family for generations. TV personality Mike Rowe filmed an episode of \u201cSomebody\u2019s Gotta Do It\u201d here. There might also be a few strands from Osbourne inside. When he came to visit, Cohoon snipped a lock, although Evans has yet to find it.",
      "Evans said her grandmother was tight-lipped on what she spent over the years, but she anticipates the worth of the art may top $1 million.",
      "As Genevieve Keeney, the head of the National Museum of Funeral History in Houston, waded through the collection, she eagerly eyed the jewelry that memorialized the dead, including a small pin containing the locks of a 7-year-old girl who died in 1811.",

      "Experts, as well as union leaders representing air traffic controllers and security screeners, warn that the impact could grow significantly worse if the shutdown continues and employees start to miss paychecks.",
      "Here is what to know about your rights as a passenger and what you can do if delays and cancellations start piling up:",
      "It is better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than to be stranded in an airport terminal, so use the airline\u2019s app or flight websites to make sure that your flight is still on before heading to the airport. This FAA site can be checked to see if there are widespread delays at your airport.",
      "Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, suggests also closely monitoring the news if you have upcoming travel plans.",
      "\u201cA deal, in theory, could come through Congress any day now, and that could put all of this doubt lingering over air travel to an end pretty quickly,\u201d Potter said.",
      "If you are already at the airport, it is time to find another flight. Get in line to speak to a customer service representative, and call or go online to connect to the airline\u2019s reservations staff. It also helps to reach out on X, the site formerly known as Twitter, because airlines might respond quickly there.",
      "Airlines will rebook you on a later flight for no additional charge. The good news right now is that this is not a peak travel time, so travelers stand a better chance of finding seats. But the busy holiday season is right around the corner, and at those peak times, passengers might have to wait days for a seat on a new flight.",
      "If these problems do become more widespread, you might consider whether it makes sense to travel by train, car or bus instead. But there is really no way to predict when and where a staff shortage might happen, and the ongoing shortage of controllers is so critical that even a small number of absences can cause problems.",
      "Potter said the shutdown is different from when a single airline is having problems and travelers can just pick another carrier. This is creating problems for entire airports at once.",
      "\u201cAs these problems expand and spread the longer the shutdown drags on, it\u2019s unlikely that there will be one airline running on time if the rest of the them are failing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect the entire system over time.\u201d",
      "You can, but airlines aren\u2019t required to put you on another carrier\u2019s flight. Some airlines, including the biggest ones except Southwest and the discount airlines, say they can put you on a partner airline. But even then it is often hit or miss.",

      "\"If the airline cancels your flight, you can say, \u2018Alright. I will take a refund and get my money back,\u2019 \u201d Potter said. \u201cThe important piece is that you get your payment returned to you. You\u2019re not just settling for an airline voucher that may expire in a year or less.\u201d",

But the Trump administration scrapped that last month, and the airlines praised him for doing so.",
      "Each airline is different. The U.S. Department of Transportation has a site that lets consumers see the commitments that each carrier makes for refunds and covering other expenses when flights are canceled or significantly delayed.",
      "Travel insurance might help if you bought a policy when you booked or used a travel credit card that offers that product, but Potter said you shouldn\u2019t assume you will be covered even if you have insurance. Check the fine print to see if you are covered in situations like this when a shortage of workers causes flight disruptions.",
      "If many flights are canceled, airline agents will soon be overwhelmed by requests. If you're traveling in a group with someone who has a higher status in the airline's loyalty program, call using their frequent flyer number. You may get quicker service.",

As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%, its first cut this year.",
      "Rate cuts by the Fed can gradually lower borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Still, the minutes underscored the deep division on the 19-person committee between those who feel that the Fed's short-term rate is too high and weighing on the economy, and those who point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence that the Fed needs to be cautious about reducing rates.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut: Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",

      "U.S. District Judge William Conley sentenced 68-year-old Andrew Pogosyan on Tuesday to a year and a day and fined him $10,000.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Pogosyan, a Russian-born U.S. citizen who lives in Madison, in June with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and three counts of smuggling.",
      "According to prosecutors, Pogosyan started using his company, Omega Diagnostics LLC, in September 2022 to ship lab equipment to Russian companies, including one that performed chemical research for the Russian military.",
      "The U.S. Department of Commerce imposed sanctions in February 2022 on exports to Russia in response to the Ukranian invasion. The sanctions require exporters to obtain licenses to ship technology and goods to Russia, particularly products that could help Russia produce chemical and biological weapons.",

      "Pogosyan pleaded guilty in July to all four counts. He had faced up to 35 years in prison.",
      "His attorney, William Coffield, said in an email Wednesday that Pogosyan is a good man who didn't understand the ramifications of his actions, and that Conley recognized there was no evidence that the lab equipment was used for anything other than medical and environmental research.",

    "story": [
      "The new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas spells trouble for rural parts of the U.S. that rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) \u2014 When Rob Coverdale started his job in 2023 as superintendent of the K-12 Crow Creek Tribal School in South Dakota, there were 15 unfilled teaching positions.",
      "Within nine months, he had filled those vacancies with Filipino teachers, the majority of whom arrived on the H-1B, a visa for skilled workers in specialty occupations.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve hired the H-1B teachers because we quite simply didn\u2019t have other applicants for those positions,\" Coverdale said. \u201cSo they're certainly not taking jobs from Americans. They're filling jobs that otherwise just simply we would not get filled.\u201d",
      "Now a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications spells trouble for those like Coverdale in rural parts of the country who rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions like education and health care.",
      "The Trump administration announced the fee on Sept. 19, arguing that employers were replacing American workers with cheaper talent from overseas. Since then, the White House has said the fee won't apply to existing visa holders and offered a form to request exemptions from the charge.",
      "H-1Bs are primarily associated with tech workers from India. Big tech companies are the biggest user of the visa, and nearly three-quarters of those approved are from India. But there are critical workers, like teachers and doctors, who fall outside that category.",
      "Over the last decade, the U.S. has faced a shortage in those and other sectors. One in eight public school positions are vacant or filled by uncertified teachers, and the American Medical Association projects a shortage of 87,000 physicians in the next decade. The shortages are often worse in small, rural communities that struggle to fill jobs due to lower wages and often lack basic necessities like shopping and home rental options.",
      "H-1B and J-1 visas provide communities an option to hire immigrants with advanced training and certification. The J-1s are short-term visas for cultural exchange programs that aren't subject to the new fee but, unlike the H-1B, don't offer a pathway to permanent residency.",
      "While large companies may be able to absorb the new fee, that's not an option for most rural communities, said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association.",
      "\u201cIt really is potentially the cost of the salary and benefits of one teacher, maybe even two, depending on the state,\u201d she said. \u201cAttaching that price tag to a single hire, it just simply puts that position out of reach for rural budgets.\u201d",
      "A coalition of health care providers, religious groups and educators filed a lawsuit on Friday to stop the H-1B fee, saying it would harm hospitals, churches, schools and industries that rely on the visa. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment and referred a query to its website.",
      "Coverdale said spots like Stephan, where Crow Creek is based, struggle to attract workers in part because of their isolation. Stephan is nearly an hour's drive from the nearest Walmart or any place that sells clothes, he said.",
      "\u201cThe more remote you are, the more challenging it is for your staff members to get to your school and serve your kids,\u201d he said.",
      "Among Coverdale's hires is Mary Joy Ponce-Torres, who had 24 years of teaching experience in the Philippines and now teaches history at Crow Creek. It was a cultural adjustment, but Ponce-Torres said she's made friends and Stephan is now a second home.",
      "\u201cI came from a private school,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I came here, I saw it was more like a rural area ... but maybe I was also looking for the same vibe, the same atmosphere where I can just take my time, take things in a much slower pace.\u201d",
      "Many immigrants like Ponce-Torres leave their family behind to pursue the experience and higher wages that a U.S. job can provide.",

      "Though schools can also use J-1 visas to bring in immigrant teachers, it increases turnover because it is shorter term.",

It is super important, in my opinion, to actually transition from the J-1 visas to the H-1B.\u201d",
      "Without enough staff, schools may hire uncertified teachers, combine classes, increase caseloads for special education managers or drop some course offerings. Shipley said any future shortage of teachers in Bison would force some classes to move online.",

      "Allison Roberts, vice president of human resources at Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in Watertown, South Dakota, said the change could be dire for health care in rural America.",

      "The former Joan Bennett, one of the last remaining members of a family generation that included President John F. Kennedy, was a model and classically-trained pianist when she married Ted Kennedy in 1958.",
      "Their lives would change unimaginably over the next decade and a half. Brother-in-law John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960 and assassinated three years later. Brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy served as attorney general under JFK, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and assassinated while seeking the presidency.",
      "Her husband was elected to the U.S. Senate and became among the country\u2019s most respected legislators despite initial misgivings that he was capitalizing on his family connections. But Ted Kennedy also lived through scandals of his own making. In 1969, the car he was driving plunged off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, killing his young female passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne.",
      "Kennedy, who swam to safety and waited hours before alerting police, later pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. Chappaquiddick shadowed him for the rest of his life, weighing against his own chances for the presidency.",
      "Joan Kennedy had three children with her husband, but also had miscarriages, including one shortly after the Chappaquiddick accident. She stood by her husband through the scandal, but their estrangement was nearly impossible to hide by the time of his unsuccessful effort to defeat President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 Democratic primaries. They had been separated by then, and would later divorce. One bumper sticker from the campaign read \u201cVote for Jimmy Carter, Free Joan Kennedy.\u201d",
      "Virginia Joan Bennett was born into a prominent Bronxville, N.Y., family and as a teen she worked as a model in TV ads. She was a classmate of Jean Kennedy, the future senator\u2019s sister, at Manhattanville College, where her exceptional beauty caught Ted Kennedy\u2019s eye when he visited the campus for a building dedication in 1957.",

      "Lopez said she was \"immediately floored\" when she read the script for the film by writer and director Bill Condon, known for his work on \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The movie is based on a 1970s novel by Manuel Puig, which Lopez described as being far ahead of its time.",

But I think the essence of who they were was very different, but still the same. And I think that was the challenge,\" Lopez explained.",
      "Lopez said the film's core message is about seeing past differences.",
      "\"When you forget about all those things, if you forget about somebody's political views and you forget, we're all entitled to our opinions about everything and our ways of thinking, and even, you know, from where we grew up and where we're from all over the world. But the truth is, we're all human, we're all the same. And if we can just see that we can allow people to be who they are and love each other anyway,\" she said.",
      "She also spoke about her character, Ingrid Luna, who appears in one musical sequence. In that scene, Ingrid helps another character escape the harsh reality of prison through a fantasy-like performance.

    "story": [
      "Thirty paintings created by the bushy-haired, soft-spoken Bob Ross will soon be up for auction to defray the costs of programming for small and rural public television stations suffering under cuts in federal funding.",
      "Ross, a public television stalwart in the 1980s and '90s, \"dedicated his life to making art accessible to everyone,\" said Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc. \"This auction ensures his legacy continues to support the very medium that brought his joy and creativity into American homes for decades.\"",
      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",
      "Bonhams in Los Angeles will auction three of Ross' paintings on Nov. 11. Other auctions will follow in London, New York, Boston and online. Bonhams sold two early 1990s mountain-and-lake scenes of Ross in August for $114,800 and $95,750.",
      "The auctions of the 30 paintings soon to be sold have an estimated total value of $850,000 to $1.4 million, Bonhams said. All profits are pledged to stations that use content from distributor American Public Television.",
      "The idea is to help stations in need with licensing fees that allow them to show popular programs that include \"The Best of Joy of Painting,\" based on Ross' show, \"America's Test Kitchen,\" \"Julia Child's French Chef Classics\" and \"This Old House.\"",
      "As desired by President Donald Trump, Congress has eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, leaving about 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations to find alternative funding sources.",
      "Many stations launched emergency fund drives. Some stations have received more help than they expected, CBS News previously reported. North Carolina public radio station WQHR raised more than $200,000 in just three days, surpassing the $174,000 they needed to fill. Hawaii Public Radio lost $525,000, but donations raised $650,000.",
      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September. Stations have also had to lay off staff and reduce programming, CBS News previously reported. No stations have shut down yet, but operators are worried about what happens if donor money dries up.",
      "\"I am a realist,\" PBS president Paula Kerger said in September. \"I have to believe that there are some vulnerable stations that are not going to make it.\"",
      "National Public Radio president and CEO Katherine Maher\u00a0told CBS News in July\u00a0that defunding public media services \"is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",

      "In a letter, Combs' lawyers urged the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that the federal Bureau of Prisons place Combs at FCI Fort Dix, a massive prison located on the grounds of the joint military base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, one of several dozen federal prisons with a residential drug treatment program, will best allow Combs \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos wrote. He also cited educational and occupational programs available at the prison, located about 70 miles south of New York City.",
      "The request from Combs' attorney came after Subramanian asked his lawyers on Friday at the sentencing hearing to let him know their preference for a prison facility.",
      "Also Monday, President Trump told reporters that Combs had asked him for a pardon. Mr. Trump, referring to Combs by the nickname \"Puff Daddy,\" did not say if he would grant the request.

      "Deonte' Nash alleged he was frightened throughout his roughly decade-long experience working for the music mogul.

His trial ended in a split verdict, with acquittals on sex trafficking and racketeering charges that could have put him behind bars for life.",
      "Combs has been locked up at a federal jail in Brooklyn, the Metropolitan Detention Center, since his September 2024 arrest. His time there will be subtracted from his sentence, meaning he could get out in about three years.",
      "In a letter to Subramanian on the eve of sentencing, Combs said he has gone through a \"spiritual reset\" in jail and is \"committed to the journey of remaining a drug free, non-violent and peaceful person.\"",
      "\"I thank God that I'm stronger, wiser, clean, clear and sober,\" he wrote.",

Those decisions, the agency has said, are based on a variety of factors, including the severity of the offense, the required security level and an inmate's programming needs.",
      "FCI Fort Dix, the largest single federal prison by population with just under 3,900 inmates, is about 64 miles southwest of New York City, where Combs was born and rose to fame as a rapper and entrepreneur in an array of businesses, including fashion, television and liquor. An adjacent minimum-security prison camp has 210 inmates.",

For a time, it was run by the warden who had been in charge of a Manhattan federal jail when financier Jeffrey Epstein killed himself at the jail in 2019. That warden, Lamine N'Diaye, has since retired.",

The same year, a Fort Dix correctional officer pleaded guilty in a separate case to pocketing bribes to smuggle in contraband.",

      "\"You have to admit, I've been misunderstood,\" said singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam. \"Even when I wrote 'Foreigner,' I started with the words, There are no words I can use because the meaning still leaves for you to choose. And so, the artist, to try and explain himself, has got to work a bit harder.\"",
      "In a way, music was a by-product of a lifelong search, says Islam (also known as Cat Stevens), who met with us backstage in London.",
      "I asked, \"Do you get something out of playing on stage that you don't, playing alone?\"",
      "\"I get scared,\" he replied. \"A lot of human beings out there!\"",
      "But this musical giant who got his start in the 1960s, and is now in his late 70s, can still move a crowd.",
      "Nicole Perry Ellis came to London's Hyde Park with her daughter Natasha to attend a Yusuf concert. She described it as a \"very emotional moment. Because before [Natasha] was born, we used to listen to the music when I was pregnant.\"",
      "Natasha described Yusuf as timeless: \"He has spirit, he has soul, and it transcends.\"",
      "\"I think my songs have always been kind of profound in some way,\" Yusuf said. \"A lot of them are so relevant to the world today. I mean, 'Wild World'? You know, come on! And 'Peace Train,' waiting for the train to arrive. Boy, do we need it, yeah. I mean they're relevant.\"",
      "His core themes have endured, as his name has gone through its evolutions. \"I had a girlfriend who looked at me one day and said, 'Ooh, you look like a cat.' And I went, 'What?' That stuck. And then I was looking for a name, because it was going to be difficult to go into the record store and ask for, like, Stephen Demetre Georgiou's latest album.\"",
      "\"Do you think you would have been as successful as Stephen Demetre Georgiou?\" I asked.",
      "\"There's no \u2026 you can't play with fate,\" he replied.",
      "In his new memoir, \"Cat on the Road to Findout,\" he explores family, faith, career, and ego.",
      "He writes that reaching superstardom in his teens was quite difficult. \"The problem with success is that it kind of detaches you from reality in some sense,\" he said. \"Who are you? Are you that person on the screen, on the stage, or is there something more to you? I was looking for some big answers.\"",
      "I asked, \"What all did you try, spiritually?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, the bookshop is full of lots of different views of life and beliefs and philosophies, so I was digging around everywhere. I think the most important thing was when I finally reached the Quran at the end. And that just brought everything together.\"",
      "He took the name Yusuf Islam, and \u2013 believing that music was haram, or forbidden \u2013 redirected his royalties to fund his charity efforts, auctioned off instruments, focused on family, and for nearly 30 years left music.",
      "Why did he believe music was forbidden? \"It took me time to realize that a lot of what I was told in the beginning when I became a Muslim was not exactly right,\" he said. \"You know, Islam doesn't forbid anything that's healthy and morally good.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you reconcile the you who put that aside, with the you who embraced music again?\"",
      "\"You go through stages,\" Yusuf said. \"At one time you can fall in love, and next time you're having such an argument with a person, you say, 'What the hell, get out of my life!' You know, you change, your attitude changes according to circumstance. Context is key.\"",
      "He provides context to a controversial chapter regarding Salman Rushdie's novel \"The Satanic Verses,\" which inflamed the Muslim world \u2013 and the fatwa calling for the author's death. In 1989, in an appearance on a British TV program where hypothetical questions were posed, he was asked if he'd attend an effigy burning of Rushdie, to which he replied, \"I would have hoped that it would have been the real thing, but actually no, if it's just an effigy I don't think I would be that moved to go there.\"",
      "\"I mean, I've got a British sense of humor,\" Yusuf said. \"I took it in a kind of slightly comical direction. It wasn't a good thing to do, because nobody laughed. So, you know, I kind of, I made a mistake in thinking that people might get the joke. But it was a serious issue, so I shouldn't have really done that.\"",
      "\"The joke you mean, saying preferred the real thing, not the effigy?\"",
      "\"Whatever, whatever, whatever.\"",
      "\"When you saw the headlines after that, do you worry even today that \u2013 \"",
      "\"Let's get off this subject, please,\" Yusuf said.",
      "\"You bring it up in the book, so it seems \u2013 \"",
      "\"No, it was only a little part of the book.\"",
      "I said, \"But it seems like with this book you partially wanted to set the record straight from your perspective.\"",
      "\"That's right,\" Yusuf replied. \"I think I've done that.\"",
      "I asked, \"How is it to sit down and write something so personal, to go through the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful?\"",
      "\"I left quite a lot of the ugly out, actually, to be honest!\"",
      "\"You were hard on yourself.\"",
      "\"Really? That's nice to know. I tried to be honest in my writing of songs, and in the writing of my book.\"",
      "This singer-songwriter who once gave up fame for faith has now found his balance, performing as Yusuf/Cat Stevens.",
      "Asked how it is to be performing using both names, Yusuf/Cat Stevens replied, \"Actually, it's very symbolic in a way, because for a long time what I wanted to do was to separate myself in a way from my past, and I did that. So, joining these two names together actually forms the complete picture of, like, who I am. And you just have to listen to the songs. They're biographical in themselves. I didn't have to write a book, actually. You just buy the records, you know?\"",

    "summary": "The three-time Oscar-winning actor has been absent from movie screens for eight years, until a collaboration with his son, Ronan, brought him back for \"Anemone,\" the story of a man living in self-exile.",
    "story": [
      "He has been called the greatest actor of his generation \u2013 a three-time Oscar-winner, and reluctant star. \"The work itself has always been, has remained nothing but a source of fascination and pleasure to me, the work itself,\" said Daniel Day-Lewis. \"The aftermath of the work has always been difficult for me. You know, you become to some extent a sales rep for that work. And I'm not good at that. I never was. And I'm still not. And that particular part of it, the public part of it, has always left me feeling emptied out.\"",
      "And eight years ago, he announced his retirement. But now, a clarification: \"I think that was a mistake,\" he said. \"I think it just created a kind of confusion. At the time, I never intended to retire from anything. I chose to stop doing one kind of work so that I could perhaps concentrate on a different kind of work.\"",
      "It was part musical interlude: \"My youngest son, Cashel, is a fiddle player. And once the idea took root in my head, like, 'I wonder if I could make him a fiddle,' that was the \u2014 you know, things tend to, yeah, it's hard to let go of a thing.\"",
      "He made three, and he says he has the makings of a fourth, \"but I just haven't got down to it yet.\"",
      "Day-Lewis admits he was surprised to feel a strong impulse to return to acting: \"And largely it was in response to the knowledge that Ronan would be making films.\"",
      "Twenty-seven-year-old middle son Ronan Day-Lewis brings credentials and expectations: His mother, filmmaker and author Rebecca Miller, and grandfather, playwright Arthur Miller.",
      "I asked Ronan, \"Was your move to film a surprise to your parents?\"",
      "\"Not really, because I started making little movies with my friends when I was, like, seven,\" he replied. \"When I was really young, I would always be the one kind of annoyingly trying to corral everyone into making a little movie on our dad's, like, flip camera in the backyard or something.\"",
      "\"Anemone\" is his directorial debut, co-written with his father, who plays Ray Stoker. The story unfolds in a remote cabin. Ronan said, \"The first kind of concrete anchor, I think, was the idea of this man who's kind of in this form of self-exile, that he's living in the middle of nowhere. For some reason that pertains to his past, he's kind of separated himself and banished himself to this isolated place.\"",
      "After twenty years, his brother (played by Sean Bean) arrives to bring Ray Stoker back to the son he's never met. Daniel said, \"I felt I knew Ray fairly early on in the writing process. I don't know why I did. I just did. I can't explain it.\"",

      "Daniel Day-Lewis is legendary for his immersive preparation \u2013 as a fashion designer (\"Phantom Thread\"), in the boxing ring (\"The Boxer\"), in a wheelchair (\"My Left Foot\"). But after more than 20 film roles, one character remains elusive: Daniel Day-Lewis.",
      "I asked what drives him to such perfection.",
      "\"I've resisted analysis to a large extent because, maybe out of superstition, I thought it might interfere with the impulse, which was strong in me and still is,\" Daniel replied. \"But I mean, put on the spot I'd say it's got something to do with that period of time which was very bleak in my life when I was sent away to school.\"",
      "His mother, actress Jill Balcon, came from a prominent British film family. His father, Cecil Day-Lewis, who died when Daniel was 15, was well-known in literary circles \u2013 perhaps not so well-known at home.",
      "\"It's not that we never got to see him,\" said Daniel. \"He was a good man. But my only conversations that I remember having with him [was] when I was in trouble, which I was frequently for all kinds of different things. That's my memory of it. It may be a distorted memory.\"",
      "In 1968, his father was named poet laureate of the United Kingdom, and Daniel was sent to boarding school at 11. \"I felt like I was at sea,\" he said. \"I had no friends. I was being bullied. I was scrappy, but in that place you're considered to be, like, just outrageously uncivilized if you took a swipe at someone, which I did now and then.\"",
      "Despite pleading, he was left to tough it out: \"It was my father's decision. He believed I should stay there, and that I would feel a sense of defeat if I left. But I don't think, because he didn't really see me, he didn't understand the degree to which I was already defeated.\"",
      "And yet, boarding school is where he found his life's work. \"I did a few little bits and pieces in school plays,\" he said. \"And it wasn't the magic of the theater for me; it was the alternative world, where everything around me seemed fairly dark. That was a place that was illuminated for me.\"",
      "But stardom came with a darker side, as he was forewarned by the head of a prestigious summer theater program for teens 50 years ago. \"He launched into a kind of cautionary tale about the world of professional acting and the theater, about the sleaze and the corruption, and I was really quite na\u00efve at that time. But something about what he said that day stayed with me. I never wondered about the work, but I began to wonder about the world that I was going into. And so, I did reach a crossroads where I wondered whether perhaps I'd become a cabinet maker, a furniture maker, instead.\"",
      "He seems to have found a comfortable place at the crossroad in \"Anemone\":\u00a0 a reluctant father on film, and devoted father off-camera.",
      "\"Anemone\" is the culmination of a yearslong father-son collaboration.",
      "I asked Ronan about the trust and confidence implied in that collaboration. \"Yeah, yeah, he never implied that that was a big deal,\" he replied. \"But I always felt that incredible sense of pressure, not wanting to let him down. I felt that actually probably more deeply than the kind of external pressure of how the film might be received, or the expectations that come with his, you know, comeback.\"",
      "An unexpected return eagerly awaited. Yet, Daniel Day-Lewis is muted in his expectations: \"We don't last long. Film sometimes can have a long life, and I suppose you can't help hoping that something of your work will be significant to a person in times to come. But there's, yeah, no guarantee of that.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Oct 2025 10:12:08 -0400",
    "summary": "The \"Hannah Montana\" actress-turned-Grammy-winning pop star talks about her album \"Something Beautiful,\" sobriety, and reconnecting with her dad through music.",
    "story": [
      "Miley Cyrus has been in the public eye for most of her life, and while you might know her music, don't think you really know her.",
      "Asked what it's like to go through life and have strangers think they know her, Cyrus replied, \"I love my life, so I don't ever really have \u2013 I haven't made too much of a list of the things that are negative about it, 'cause there's so many great things. But I would say one of the things that I don't love and don't appreciate so much is when you meet somebody and they go, 'Wow, you're like, so cool. You're so smart. You're nothing like I thought you would be.' So yeah, that's a tough one.\"",
      "Her ninth album might not be what you'd expect, either. In \"Something Beautiful,\" Cyrus stretches herself artistically. As one critic put it, the album takes her from pop princess to legacy artist. That's quite a leap, even for someone with music in their blood.",
      "Miley's mom, Tish Cyrus Purcell, is a producer. Dad is country star Billy Ray Cyrus. Her godmother? Dolly Parton.",
      "Miley Cyrus lived with showbiz royalty, and that raspy voice, all her life: \"I've sounded like this since I was little. My dad used to have all the country singers come over to the house, and George Jones would, you know, joke that I had smoked cigarettes or been up all night, you know, even when I was four years old.\"",
      "At age 13, she was suddenly famous after being cast as \"Hannah Montana,\" in the Disney Channel series about a girl who was a typical teen by day and a pop star by night. It's a role she's still proud of: \"I love her. She's everything. I would have nothing, none of this \u2013 I mean, maybe I could've figured it out, maybe I could've gotten myself from Nashville, Tennessee, to Los Angeles. I don't know. But she did it a lot faster, and better, and set me up for the life that I have now. So love her, gratitude, all of that.\"",
      "The years after \"Hannah Montana\" were a bit less wholesome. Her 2013 MTV Music Video Awards performance was met with shock and outrage, especially among moms of young kids who had grown up watching her as a Disney star.",
      "I asked, \"There were moms that were trying to, I guess, cancel you?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I was the first person to maybe ever be canceled, I guess.\"",
      "\"How would you describe that time in your life?\"",
      "\"Well, you know, I didn't know until I was older actually how brutal it really was,\" Cyrus said. \"It was very, I guess, you know, challenging for other people. But for me it was a good time. It looked fun, and it was fun.\"",
      "Eventually it was all a little too much fun. Cyrus says she's been sober for a few years now.",
      "\"How has sobriety affected you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I like showing up 100%, 100% of the time,\" Cyrus replied. \"The hardest part about balancing, you know, any sort of substance use or drinking when you want to do what I do is you're going, 'Okay, well, now I have to get sober for this thing, 'cause I wanna show up my best.' And now, I get to trim out so much of the preparation of getting yourself into the right place mentally and physically. I'm just always ready.\"",
      "Something she was ready for: \"Flowers,\" the biggest pop single of 2023, and her biggest record to date.",
      "She was also ready for this: Her first two Grammys, for best pop solo performance and record of the year, for \"Flowers.\" Accepting the Grammy she said, \"This award is amazing, but I hope it doesn't change anything, because my life was beautiful yesterday.\"",
      "For Miley Cyrus, today is looking good as well.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" joined her this summer at L.A.'s Million Dollar Theatre, where she was shooting a music video for the deluxe version of \"Something Beautiful.\" The song is \"Secrets,\" and if you think it sounds a bit like Fleetwood Mac, you're right: you can hear drummer Mick Fleetwood and guitarist Lindsey Buckingham on the track.",
      "Miley sings about a white flag of surrender, and her outfit is basically a white flag in itself. She told us the song is meant as a peace offering to her dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. They'd been estranged since her parents' divorce in 2022.",
      "Asked how he reacted when she gave him the song, Miley replied, \"My dad cried. You know, you don't see your dad cry a lot. But with me and my dad, we just have always communicated better through music with each other.\"",
      "\"And you're at peace now with each other?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "And at 32, it seems Miley Cyrus is at peace with herself.",
      "\"I think the authentic joy of doing what I want to do has always eclipsed the negatives for me,\" she said. \"I feel really good. And I really like who I am, and I like what I'm doing with my life. And I think if I was outside of myself, I would want to be a part of what I'm doing in any way that I could be. 'Cause I think what I'm doing is cool. So, that actually feels good. I like what I do. I like who I am.\"",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance.",
      "Brunkow, 64, is a senior program manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle. Ramsdell, 64, is a scientific adviser for Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi, 74, is a distinguished professor at the Immunology Frontier Research Center at Osaka University in Japan.",
      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",
      "\"Their discoveries have been decisive for our understanding of how the immune system functions and why we do not all develop serious autoimmune diseases,\" said Olle K\u00e4mpe, chair of the Nobel Committee.",

    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "The dispute at the heart of the ongoing U.S. government shutdown\u00a0centers around a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit. A new Oct. 3 survey from health information group KFF found that three-quarters of those polled say they want Congress to extend the tax credits, with about 59% of Republicans saying they would like to see an extension.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF. About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

    "story": [
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it has opened an investigation into nearly 2.9 million Tesla vehicles after reports of traffic safety violations linked to the electric car maker's Full Self-Driving system, according to a\u00a0filing on the government regulator's website.",
      "The probe by the agency's Office of Defects Investigation involves Tesla vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised)\" and \"FSD (Beta)\" versions of the the company's self-driving systems. Both require \"a fully attentive driver who is engaged in the driving task at all times,\" NHTSA said in a document filed as part of the probe.",
      "Reports of traffic violations include vehicles operating with FSD driving through red tra\ufb03c signals and initiating lane changes into opposing tra\ufb03c.",
      "NHTSA has received reports of 58 safety violations linked to Tesla vehicles with FSD. Those incidents include more than a dozen crashes and fires, along with 23 injuries, according to the agency.",
      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "Such problems have led lawmakers and safety regulators to question whether Tesla's automated system and other like it will ever be able to operate safely on a widespread scale. A new law in California that would hold driverless car companies accountable for traffic violations is set to\u00a0take effect next year.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \"summon\" technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",
      "Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla allegedly has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.",
      "CEO Elon Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not fixed such problems. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.",

    "summary": "The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments to the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS is adjusting the income limits for its federal income tax brackets to account for the impact of inflation, an annual reset that could provide relief for some Americans when they file their taxes next year.",
      "The IRS makes these adjustments, typically in October or November, to avoid what it known as \"bracket creep,\" which is when inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, potentially forcing them to dole out more money come April.",
      "The upshot: Americans will have to earn more income next year before reaching a higher tax bracket. For example, the upper tax limit on a single filer making $50,000 will be 12% in 2026 versus 22% in 2025.",
      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "Standard deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200",
      "Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150",
      "Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Seniors could see additional relief due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for people aged 65 and older. The tax break, which is set to expire at the end of 2028, is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly.",
      "The IRS \u00a0announced Wednesday that an agency-wide furlough would begin on Oct. 8 due to a lapse in federal appropriations as a result of the government shutdown. Taxpayers with an Oct. 15 extension deadline should plan on submitting their returns as planned, according to the IRS.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,\" a spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is.",
      "For instance, a married couple with $150,000 in gross income would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%. However, their effective tax rate is much lower:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",

      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",

      "Airports in U.S. cities including Denver; Newark, New Jersey; and Burbank, California, experienced flight delays Monday amid shortages of air traffic controllers, according to federal flight data.",
      "Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.",
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports comes as the U.S. government shutdown that has shuttered federal agencies continues into a second week.",
      "Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.",
      "According to CBS News Los Angeles, plane captains taking off from the Burbank airport were being asked to contact SoCal Approach, a San Diego-based company also known as Southern California TRACON, so they could communicate and get departure clearance.",
      "When there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure the on-duty personnel aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that can creates flight delays and cancellations.",
      "\"Fragile\" aviation system",
      "On Monday, a total of almost 6,000 flights were delayed in the U.S., including 42% of flights leaving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 23% of those from Hollywood Burbank\u00a0according to tracking site FlightAware. Weather issues also caused some flight delays on Monday.",
      "As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",

      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",

      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",

      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices.",

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",

Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",

      "Generally, middle-income older Americans are also dying younger than wealthier people, the researchers founds. About 15% of seniors with annual household incomes of roughly $60,000 died during the four-year study period, compared with about 11% in households with incomes of around $120,000.",
      "\"This is the first time we've tied health and wealth together \u2014 this was really shocking for me,\" said Jessica Johnston, senior director of the NCOA's Center for Economic Well-Being, of the nine-year life gap. \"We all traditionally and culturally were taught to value our elders, and if we played by the rules we could age well, and I think that's changing.\"",
      "The study is based on an analysis of data from 2018 to 2022 gathered through the University of Michigan's Health and Retirement Study, a longitudinal panel study that tracks 10,000 households. NCOA, a nonprofit group based in Arlington, Virginia, advocates for older adults.",
      "The findings have implications for an aging society that has seen widening economic inequality, with the income gap between the richest and poorest households growing wider in recent decades, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., as well as\u00a0to other researchers.",
      "As the U.S. population ages, the divide between rich and poor is also reflected in the experiences of senior citizens, with many reaching retirement age without the financial resources to handle shocks like a health emergency or the loss of a spouse, the NCOA study found.",
      "The difference in average mortality age by income could be due to a lack of preventative care for low-income seniors, an inability to pay for care as they age or the stress of financial instability, Johnston said.",
      "The poverty rate among U.S. seniors rose to 15% last year from 14% in 2023, the highest among all age groups, according to Census data.",
      "\"Older adults are placed into situations where they are going to have to make really difficult decisions: Am I going to go to the grocery store, am I going to pay rent or am I going to get my medication?\" Johnston told CBS News. \"It's not only about forgoing one of those things, but it's the added stress about those decisions.\"",
      "About 80% of people over 60 have few, or even zero, financial assets and would struggle to cope with a financial shock like the loss of a spouse or needing long-term care, according to the report. Most of those Americans will face financial insecurity in their later years, the researchers said.",
      "\"If older adults can't afford long-term care or can't afford medicine, family members are often picking up that cost,\" Johnston said. \"The lost economic productivity among Gen Xers and millennials will play out over the next one to two decades.\"",

      "The 30 paintings to be auctioned span his career. Most were created on-air during single episodes of Ross' show, \"The Joy of Painting.\" Ross was known for his calm demeanor. During the show, he often spoke about painting happy little clouds and trees, and making no mistakes, only \"happy accidents.\" He died of cancer complications in 1995.",

      "NPR has also encouraged donors in wealthier areas to support stations in regions that are in greater need. PBS and NPR have also worked to reduce the annual dues stations pay for programming and other services to lower their costs. Some stations are working on collaborations to see if they can share services and reduce costs.",
      "Still, the federal cuts have had an impact. Not all stations have seen an outpouring of donors. PBS slashed its budget by 21% and laid off about 100 employees in September.

    "story": [
      "The union representing the nation's air traffic controllers is directing its members to keep working during the U.S. government shutdown now stretching\u00a0into its second week, with the labor group warning that failure to report for duty could lead to termination.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) told members Monday that it discourages federal employees from taking any actions that would compromise air safety. The group represents more than 20,000 air traffic controllers, engineers and professionals in aviation safety-related roles.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals take their responsibility to protect the safety of the flying public very seriously. Participating in a job action could result in removal from federal service,\" NATCA said in a message to members posted in part on the group's\u00a0website. \"It is not only illegal, but it also undermines NATCA's credibility and severely weakens our ability to effectively advocate for you and your families.\"",
      "Sick calls edge up",
      "The union's warning came as Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey that TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick since the shutdown began last week.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Duffy also acknowledged the potential effect on worker morale of being required to work without pay.",
      "\"They have bills,\" he said. \"So now they're thinking about that at the same time that they're controlling the airspace, which I don't like that. \u2026 We want them to leave their personal problems at the door when they go into a tower or into a facility.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Duffy told\u00a0CNBC that controllers are anxious both because the job itself is demanding and because \"they're concerned they may not get a paycheck.\"",
      "The \"shutdown is forcing them to work without the guarantee that their paychecks come in a timely manner. So they're stressed,\" he added.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration defines air traffic controllers as\u00a0essential workers, requiring them to stay on the job during government closures despite going unpaid. Essential employees required to continue working during a shutdown are guaranteed back pay once the stalemate ends and lawmakers restore government funding.",
      "\"We cannot stress enough that it is essential to avoid any actions that could reflect poorly on you, our Union, or our professions,\" NATCA said in the message to workers.\u00a0\"We urge you to stand in solidarity with your brothers and sisters by continuing to exhibit the same unwavering professionalism that the aviation community and the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"Uncertainty and hardships\"",
      "In a video message on TikTok, NATCA President Nick Daniels also noted that the government shutdown \"creates uncertainty and hardships for our members.\"",
      "NATCA didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "TSA officers are also deemed essential essential workers under federal rules and must continue reporting to work during the lapse in federal funding. During previous shutdowns, being forced to work without pay has led to a rise in worker absences\u00a0and some leaving government service, according to former TSA officials.",
      "During the 34-day government shutdown from December of 2018 to January of 2019, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick, according to the agency, leading to delays in security screenings at major airports across the U.S.",
      "More recently, a\u00a0nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers has led to delays at airports across the U.S. According to a CBS News review, more than 90% of air traffic control towers across the country are understaffed (Visit\u00a0fly.faa.gov\u00a0for real-time information on any flight impacts at U.S. airports because of staffing, weather or other factors.)",
      "As the impasse in Congress continues, the Senate is expected to hold procedural votes again on Monday night on dueling measures to fund the government and end the shutdown.",

      "\"The Official Release Party of a Showgirl\" played at hundreds of theaters nationwide over the weekend to enthusiastic fans decked out in friendship bracelets and other Swift-themed attire. The movie featured the world premiere of Swift's music video, \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" one of the 12 tracks on her new studio album, along with behind-the-scenes footage.",
      "The album, released Friday, sold a total of 2.7 million physical and digital copies in its first day in the U.S, according to industry research firm Luminate.

      "Approximately 500 National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois have been deployed in the Chicago area and mobilized to protect federal agents and facilities amid a legal battle over their deployment.",
      "According to the U.S. Northern Command at the Department of Defense, approximately 200 soldiers from the Texas National Guard and 300 soldiers from the Illinois National Guard have been \"employed in the greater Chicago area.\" Their mobilization will last for a period of at least 60 days.",
      "\"These forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,\" Northern Command said in a statement.",
      "The troops have been stationed at the U.S. Army Reserve Center in southwest suburban Elwood, where new fencing has been installed since the Texas guard members first arrived on Tuesday. Crews also have installed privacy screens along the interior of the existing fence line.",
      "Several trailers have been set up at the facility as temporary living quarters. Several soldiers were seen moving in with bags of belongings on Tuesday; some holding rifles and carrying folding chairs, possibly for meetings or other trainings.",
      "Northern Command said as part of their duties to protect federal agents and facilities, the troops would be assigned to establish security perimeters, perform crowd control, and use de-escalation tactics. While soldiers would be allowed to temporarily detain people to prevent an assault or interference with federal agents, Northern Command said they will not be arresting protesters.",
      "There were a handful of demonstrations outside the facility on Wednesday; a couple to protest against the arrival of Texas guard members, and a couple more to support them.",
      "Illinois state leaders said they only got word late Monday night that the 200 Texas National Guard troops would be stationed at the Elwood base starting Tuesday.",
      "Retired U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Richard Hayes was the highest-ranking member of the Illinois National Guard. In his 30-plus-year career, he said he's never seen a National Guard from a different state federalized and then sent to another state.",

It doesn't mean it's necessarily illegal, it's just different,\" he said. \"As far as the soldiers are concerned, the Illinois National Guard, even the Texas National Guard, they don't get a say in whether they go or not go. It's not a political organization, they're just here to do what they're being asked to do.\"",
      "There has been little movement in or out of the training facility since the troops arrived, and CBS News Chicago legal analyst Irv Miller said he's not surprised.",
      "It remains in question whether the troops will be sent out on protection details, since the state of Illinois and city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard. Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson have argued there is no crisis requiring the troops' presence in the Chicago area.",
      "Federal judge April Perry scheduled a hearing for Thursday for arguments on a request for a temporary restraining order blocking the troop deployment. Perry declined to immediately issue that restraining order on Monday when the lawsuit was filed to give the federal government time to file briefs, which it did, minutes before the 11:59 p.m. CDT Wednesday deadline she set.",
      "In the 59-page filing, the government argued that President Trump has the legal authority to deploy the troops and that state objections should not block the operation. The federal attorneys also argued that courts should be \"highly deferential\" when reviewing a president's judgment in such matters in light of the authority they say the executive branch is given by the Constitution and statutes.",
      "Miller said it's likely leaders are waiting for the judge's decision before making any moves.",
      "\"Oh, absolutely. I mean, the judge didn't explicitly state that they couldn't come into the city, but I think if you read between the lines as to what she was saying, that it probably would be a good idea if everybody waited until she made the decision on Thursday to decide what they're going to actually do,\" Miller said.",
      "Miller said he expects the judge to grant the temporary restraining order prohibiting the deployment for now, but any decision will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "A federal judge in Oregon has blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Portland. That judge has ruled the relatively small protests outside Portland's immigration processing facility didn't justify the use of federalized forces and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's state sovereignty.",
      "Since that ruling, Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has called on U.S. Northern Command to demobilize the 200 Oregon National Guard troops and 200 California National Guard troops that the Trump administration had mobilized for Portland.",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Wednesday's\u00a0government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday posted a banner in large type on its homepage blaming the shutdown on the \"Radical Left,\" an allegation that an ethics group said was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act.",
      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "\"Instead of agreeing to a clean funding extension, Democrats are planning a government shutdown over their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands, like free health care for illegal aliens,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told CBS News in a statement Wednesday regarding the complaint. \"The Democrats petty political games are unnecessarily hurting the most vulnerable Americans in our society. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a Democrat shutdown on the American people?\"",
      "An HUD spokesperson told CBS News in another statement Wednesday that the \"Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.\"",
      "And in a separate statement provided later Wednesday, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that the \"Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD's Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media. Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took effect at 12 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night that \"Republicans have until midnight to cut the garbage and get serious,\" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the shutdown \"totally avoidable,\" adding that \"if the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.\"",

That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday morning after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this.

The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",

      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",

      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:55:06 -0400",
    "summary": "Photos of Jeffrey Epstein's cell show a scene of disarray that never underwent a proper inspection, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The federal investigation into the death of convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was marred by significant lapses, experts told CBS News, including the failure by investigators to interview potential witnesses, properly preserve certain evidence and run basic forensic tests.",
      "Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown New York City, in what was later ruled a suicide, according to court documents. One of those officers was the only person to attest to seeing Epstein hanging by a bedsheet from his bunk.",
      "And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death \u2014 but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene \u2014 appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos, many of which have never been published. \"How are there not way more people pointing out the absurdity of this?\"",
      "The images were previously obtained by 60 Minutes. After the recent release of surveillance video from the night Epstein died, which appeared to show details that contradicted official reports, CBS News reviewed them and other documents with several forensic experts.",
      "The results of the federal investigation were made public in 2023, four years after Epstein's death, in a report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel , but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \"",

      "President Trump has cast the strikes as part of a broader gambit to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of deadly narcotics into the U.S. His administration has designated several cartels and Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations, and since August, several U.S. Navy vessels have been stationed in the Caribbean as part of an anti-cartel mission \u2014 drawing stiff backlash from the Venezuelan government.",
      "\"Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people and the destruction of families,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech in Virginia marking the Navy's 250th anniversary over the weekend. \"So when you think of it that way, what we're doing is actually an act of kindness.\"",
      "In a notice to Congress obtained by CBS News, the Trump administration described the passengers on one alleged drug boat as \"unlawful combatants\" \u2014 the term that President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al Qaeda \u2014 and argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with the cartels.",

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked an effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela.",
      "Democrats forced a vote on the issue under the War Powers Act. In a 48-51 vote, the effort failed to garner enough support to move forward.",
      "The resolution, led by Sens. Adam Schiff of California and Tim Kaine of Virginia, would have blocked the U.S. military from engaging in hostilities with \"any non-state organization engaged in the promotion, trafficking, and distribution of illegal drugs and other related activities\" without congressional authorization.",
      "\"There has been no authorization to use force by Congress in this way,\" Schiff said Wednesday, saying the strikes risk escalating into a full-blown conflict with Venezuela. \"I feel it is plainly unconstitutional.\"",
      "The strikes in the Caribbean Sea have prompted bipartisan backlash, with lawmakers questioning their legality. Congress, which has the sole authority under the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "The Trump administration says it has conducted four strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats near Venezuela since Sept. 2, killing at least 21 people.",
      "In a notification to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was at the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans, told reporters the president has the authority to order the strikes without congressional authorization.",
      "\"These are targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" he said.",
      "Regarding claims that the U.S. is acting in self-defense, David Janovsky, the acting director of The Constitution Project, said, \"The situation in the Caribbean is not that.\"",
      "Democrats' war powers resolution said the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations \"provides no legal authority for the president to use force against members of designated organizations or any foreign state.\"",
      "Kaine said the administration has not provided answers to lawmakers' questions on the intelligence supporting the strikes, the legal rationale for them or why the decision was made to attack the boats instead of intercept them.",
      "\"The White House does not maintain there's any congressional authorization,\" Kaine said. \"These military actions should stop unless authorized by Congress \u2014 not stopped, period, permanently, forever, can't-do-them stopped \u2014 unless authorized by congressional action.\"",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\"",
      "\"What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,\" Paul wrote.",
      "Paul underscored his point in a floor speech Wednesday, saying the strikes risk killing innocent people and the administration has presented no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "Paul added, \"the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling.\"",
      "During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes.",
      "\"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified,\" Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said.",
      "There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "After the Iran strikes, the Senate voted down a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran.",
      "\"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited,\" Janovsky said. \"The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean. So I think that certainly creates more ongoing urgency for Congress to act in some way in this case.\"",
      "Schiff said Congress has abdicated its war-declaring responsibilities because members don't want to go on the record on the issue. He said that sets a dangerous precedent.",
      "\"We're blowing up ships thousands of miles from our shore,\" Schiff said. \"What is to stop some other nation from deciding, well, they're going to use the same precedent to blow up ships thousands of miles from their shore, whether in the South China Sea or elsewhere, with a purported rationale that they're engaged in some kind of trafficking and therefore they're taking action?

      "Israel and Hamas have struck a deal for Hamas to release all remaining hostages and for Israel to withdraw its forces to an \"agreed upon line,\" President Trump announced Wednesday, in what he called the \"first Phase\" of a peace deal to end the two-year-long war.",
      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Two regional sources told CBS News there is an agreement on all sides in principle on a hostage release, but procedural issues remain. Once those details are handled, it will be 48 hours before any release starts, sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump, in an interview Wednesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity, said that hostages would \"probably\" be released on Monday, and the exchange would include the release of the bodies of deceased hostages still being held by Hamas.",
      "\"Hostages are going to be released. It's, probably, our time, would be probably Monday,\" Mr. Trump told Hannity. \"... And that'll include the bodies of the dead.\"",
      "A senior White House official previously told CBS News that the hostages could be released on Monday. The deal will go to Israel's cabinet for approval on Thursday, and if it votes yes, the Israeli military will need to withdraw to an agreed-upon line in the Gaza Strip, which should take under 24 hours. Then Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested to Hannity that other parts of the Israel-Hamas peace plan he laid out last week\u00a0\u2014 including a committee to oversee governance in Gaza \u2014 could be forthcoming.",
      "\"I think you're going to see people getting along, and you'll see Gaza being rebuilt,\" the president said. \"People are going to be taken care of. It's going to be a different world.\"",
      "Majed al-Ansari, an adviser to Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, also confirmed the deal on Wednesday, writing on X that an agreement was reached on \"the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also released a short statement on the hostages that read, \"With God's help we will bring them all home.\"",
      "In a follow-up statement, Netanyahu said it was a \"big day for Israel\" and that he would \"convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home.\" Netanyahu and Mr. Trump spoke Wednesday, which the Israeli government described as a \"very emotional and warm conversation.\"",
      "Hamas also confirmed in a statement it had reached an agreement.",
      "The terrorist group praised Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish mediators in helping broker a deal, and specifically thanked Mr. Trump for his \"efforts.\" It also called on the president to ensure that Israel \"fully complies with the terms of the agreement.\"",
      "In his earlier Truth Social post, Mr. Trump wrote: \"All Parties will be treated fairly!\"",
      "The announcement came just hours after Mr. Trump said he may travel to the Middle East this weekend, and was open to potentially traveling to the Gaza Strip.",
      "During an unrelated event at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump read a note that was passed to him by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The president said Rubio's note said negotiators were \"pretty close to a deal,\" and that they would \"need him\" pretty quickly.",
      "A little over a week ago, Mr. Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan at a White House meeting with Netanyahu, who expressed his full support for the proposal.",
      "The current round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 6 in Egypt, with Egyptian and Qatari officials acting as intermediaries. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been expected to join the talks on Wednesday, days after Netanyahu confirmed he had sent a delegation \"to close the technical details of the release of our hostages.\"",
      "The war in Gaza, which has roiled the Middle East, was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. That attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza against Hamas, which the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist organization, has killed more than 67,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan had called for Hamas to release all 48 remaining hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. In return, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, along with approximately 1,700 other Gazans detained since the start of the war.",
      "Hamas said on Oct. 4 it agreed to key portions of Mr. Trump's original proposal \u2014 including the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and relinquishing its governance of Gaza. But the group had said other parts of the plan needed to be further negotiated.",

      "\"Unfortunately, those negotiations have not been as successful as we had hoped,\" said the Association, which represents reporters who cover the Pentagon.",
      "In September, the Defense Department sent reporters a memo saying that they'd be required to sign a document acknowledging they would not disclose either classified or controlled unclassified information that is not formally authorized for publication. It warned Pentagon reporters they could lose their press credentials for \"unauthorized access, attempted unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure\" of classified information or anything designated as \"controlled unclassified information.\"",
      "The memo also said, \"DoW information must be approved before public release \u2026 even if it is unclassified.\" The Trump administration\u00a0has sought to rename the Defense Department to the Department of War, though a permanent renaming could require congressional approval.",
      "Currently, news organizations, including CBS News, are assigned workspaces and credentials that allow journalists limited access in the Pentagon.",
      "Compliance with the directive would mean that journalists would not be able to use unnamed U.S. military sources in much of their reporting without risking loss of access to the Pentagon.",
      "Many media outlets balked at the directive and vowed to push back. The New York Times said in a statement the restrictions were \"at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy.\"",
      "Over the course of negotiations over the restrictions, the Pentagon dropped a requirement for reporters \"to express agreement with the new policy as a condition for obtaining press credentials,\" the Association's statement said. But it went on to say that \"the Pentagon is still asking us to affirm in writing our 'understanding' of policies that appear designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs.\"",
      "The Association said that the new credentialing policy \"still leaves open the threat of the Department of Defense revoking credentials for reporters who exercise their First Amendment rights by seeking information that hasn't been pre-approved for formal release, even when the information is entirely unclassified.\"",
      "\"The policy conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone within the DoD, warning against any unapproved interactions with the press and even suggesting it's criminal to speak without express permission \u2014 which plainly, it is not,\" the statement said.",
      "News outlets were asked to sign the revised guidelines by next week.",
      "The Association also said it was \"surprised and disturbed to learn through the new policy statement that the Pentagon plans to move all of our news organizations from our dedicated workspaces,\" a move it fears will isolate reporters and make it more difficult to communicate with sources and military spokespeople.",
      "\"We hope the Pentagon reconsiders,\" the Association said.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said on X that the department has taken an \"accommodating approach\" and \"engaged in good-faith negotiations with the Pentagon Press Association, maintaining open dialogue with its members and accepting many of their suggested edits.\"",
      "Parnell said reporters are not required to clear their stories with the Pentagon, and are only being asked to confirm that they understand the department's policies on how information is handled.",
      "\"Access to the Pentagon is a privilege, not a right and the Department is not only legally permitted, but morally obligated to impose reasonable regulations on the exercise of that privilege,\" Parnell wrote.",

      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",

      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 20:07:05 -0400",
    "summary": "Former FBI Director James Comey, a longtime foe of President Trump, appeared in Virginia for an arraignment, in his first court appearance since he was charged.",
    "story": [
      "Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from congressional testimony he gave five years ago, appearing in court for an arraignment Wednesday after the Justice Department criminally charged the ex-FBI chief and Trump foe in late September.",
      "The proceeding at the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, came nearly two weeks after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of lying to Congress and obstructing a congressional investigation when he testified before a Senate panel in September 2020.",
      "Comey spoke during the proceedings Wednesday. When the judge asked whether he understood the charges, he replied, \"I do, your honor, thank you very much.\" Prosecutors did not seek to have him detained, and Comey was released on his own recognizance.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who is presiding over the case, set a trial date for early January, though that could change. Comey will seek to have the indictment dismissed before a trial, his lawyer said..",
      "During the arraignment, Nathaniel Lemons, one of the federal prosecutors brought on to work on the case, said it could involve classified information, which could bring complications. Nachmanoff, however, noted that only two charges have been brought against Comey.",
      "\"The government is going to be under an extraordinary amount of pressure\" to produce classified documents or declassify them, Nachmanoff said. \"There should be no reason this case gets off track.\"",
      "Patrick Fitzgerald, Comey's lawyer, told the court that they \"see this as a simple case.\"",
      "Prosecutors estimated a trial will take two to three days, though Fitzgerald said he would seek to have the case dismissed on several grounds: vindictive and unlawful prosecution, and the legality of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's appointment to that role.",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he had selected Halligan to temporarily lead the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Virginia after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert from the post.",
      "Siebert had been kept on as the top prosecutor for the office by the judges on the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia in May. Because of the involvement of judges in that district in extending Siebert's tenure as U.S. attorney, the challenge to Halligan's appointment will be heard by other judges outside the district.",
      "Comey has said he's innocent and, in a video after he was indicted, declared \"let's have a trial.\" His wife, Patrice, and daughter, Maurene, a former prosecutor in New York, were in the courtroom for the proceeding. Maurene Comey was fired from the Justice Department in July and has since sued the Trump administration over her ouster.",
      "The Justice Department's prosecution of the former FBI director marked a significant escalation in President Trump's efforts to go after his political foes. Mr. Trump has for years attacked Comey, who was FBI director when the bureau investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 election.",
      "Days before Comey was indicted, the president took to social media to urge Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against the former FBI director and other political opponents, writing, \"We can't delay any longer.\"",
      "More on Comey's arraignment",
      "The arraignment took place in open court, but cameras were not allowed.",
      "Comey's lawyer said his team would file several motions to have the charges dismissed, including alleging the former FBI director is a victim of vindictive prosecution and arguing the U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Halligan, was appointed invalidly.",
      "\"Patrick Fitzgerald is a hell of a lawyer, and I would not want to pre-guess what strategy he's going to follow here,\" said Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Where did Comey's arraignment take place?",
      "Comey was arraigned at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, which is part of the Eastern District of Virginia. The case is likely being heard there because the charges are based on a 2020 Senate hearing that Comey attended remotely from his Virginia home.",
      "If the case goes to trial, Comey will face a jury pool made up of residents of the Washington, D.C., suburbs \u2014 an area that generally disfavors President Trump.",
      "Some 62.6% of voters in the eastern district's Alexandria division voted for Democrat Kamala Harris last year, and 34.1% voted for Mr. Trump. The division includes Alexandria and several other cities and counties in Northern Virginia.",
      "Who is the prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan?",
      "The case against Comey is being overseen by Lindsey Halligan, the acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia who was sworn into the role just days before Comey was indicted.",
      "A former Florida insurance lawyer, Halligan previously worked as a personal attorney to Mr. Trump, and was part of his defense team in a federal case accusing him of mishandling classified documents. More recently, Halligan worked as a White House aide.",
      "She took over the office after the resignation of former acting U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "In an unusual move, Halligan has handled parts of the prosecution herself so far. She personally signed Comey's indictment and appeared in court when the grand jury returned the indictment.",
      "Two assistant U.S. attorneys from the Eastern District of North Carolina were added to the case Tuesday: Gabriel Diaz and Nathaniel Lemons.",
      "Who is Comey's attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald?",
      "Comey is being represented by Fitzgerald, a well-known attorney who retired as a partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in 2023.",
      "Fitzgerald was named special counsel in George W. Bush's administration, to investigate\u00a0 a 2003 leak that revealed the identity of CIA officer Valerie Plame. He also served as U.S. attorney in Chicago for more than a decade, overseeing the prosecution of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich.",
      "Who is Judge Nachmanoff?",
      "Nachmanoff was assigned to oversee Comey's case. He was nominated to the federal bench by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate in a 52-46 vote. Three Republicans joined all Democrats in voting yes: Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
      "Nachmanoff previously worked in the district as a public defender and magistrate judge. While in the latter role, he oversaw the 2019 arraignment of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two players in Mr. Trump's first impeachment who were charged with campaign finance violations.",
      "Mr. Trump has attacked Nachmanoff, writing on Truth Social that Comey \"was just assigned a Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge, so he's off to a very good start.\"",
      "What is Comey charged with?",
      "The first count accuses him of making a false statement in a September 2020 Senate hearing.",
      "Prosecutors allege Comey falsely asserted he had never authorized an FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in news reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations into Hillary Clinton. In a testy back-and-forth five years ago, Comey told Republican Sen. Ted Cruz that he stood by testimony he gave in 2017 in which he said he didn't approve any anonymous sources.",
      "The indictment does not explain the substance of the alleged leak or specify which FBI staffer Comey is accused of giving permission to leak.",
      "Cruz's questions focused on an incident in which Comey and his onetime deputy, Andrew McCabe, gave inconsistent stories about a 2016 Wall Street Journal article on one of the FBI's Clinton probes. McCabe said he told Comey after the story came out that McCabe had authorized staffers to talk to the Journal, but Comey says McCabe told him no such thing. The Justice Department's internal watchdog sided with Comey and found McCabe lacked candor.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CNN interview, McCabe said he hasn't been approached by the FBI in connection with the Comey probe and doubted the indictment was about him, noting that he didn't ask Comey for permission to release information to the media because he didn't need permission.",
      "Comey has also been probed by the Justice Department's watchdog for releasing memos on his interactions with Mr. Trump to his friend, Daniel Richman, who shared their contents to the New York Times. The watchdog found Comey violated FBI policies but didn't leak classified material.",
      "The second count against Comey accuses him of obstructing a congressional proceeding by \"making false and misleading statements\" in the same 2020 hearing.",
      "And in a rare move, the grand jury declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress in the 2020 hearing, relating to testimony Comey gave lawmakers that he didn't remember getting a tip from the intelligence community referring to Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump.",
      "Many critics believe the Comey indictment is the result of Mr. Trump's determination to punish a longtime political foe. The president fired Comey in 2017, and the two have traded barbs since then. Mr. Trump publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into Comey before he was charged, and the president celebrated the indictment shortly after it was handed down.",
      "Before Comey was charged, some staff in the Office of the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia circulated a memo arguing charges should not be brought, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the case. After Comey was indicted, Bondi said in a statement the move \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"",

    "summary": "The last of 10 inmates who escaped a New Orleans jail in mid-May was captured Wednesday, after a tip led law enforcement to an Atlanta home.",
    "story": [
      "A five-month manhunt for Derrick Groves \u2014 the last of 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail in mid-May \u2014 ended Wednesday afternoon after a tip led federal law enforcement to a crawl space in an Atlanta home, investigators say.",
      "Deputy U.S. Marshal Brian Fair of the Eastern District of Louisiana told CBS News that Groves, convicted of a 2018 double murder, was arrested shortly after 2 p.m. ET following a coordinated operation between the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force and the Atlanta Police Department SWAT team.",
      "The arrest stemmed from a Crime Stoppers Greater New Orleans tip received earlier this summer that pointed investigators toward the Atlanta area. Fair declined to specify when the tip came in, citing safety concerns and the need to protect the informant.",
      "\"We've been receiving tips all summer,\" he said. \"We don't want to get somebody hurt or anything, so we're not putting the exact time frame on when that tip came in.\"",
      "After weeks of follow-up work, marshals in Louisiana pushed out a lead to counterparts in Georgia. Officers executed a search warrant at a home in the Atlanta area that investigators believe Groves may have been staying in for some time. Fair said it was \"possibly a rental home,\" but added, \"There's a lot of follow-up work that'll be done on this to answer those questions.\"",
      "At first, it appeared the house was empty. \"Normally during our fugitive work, we have at least some signs that the person is at the house \u2014 movement, running, something,\" Fair said. \"This did not happen.\"",
      "Investigators deployed gas into the home multiple times, including in the basement, before discovering Groves hiding inside a narrow crawl space.",
      "\"We did have concerns maybe he wasn't in the house,\" Fair said. \"But ultimately, they found him hiding in a crawl space. I believe that crawl space was in the basement \u2026 and he had put some thought and work into the hiding space he was in.\"",
      "Fair said Groves appeared \"prepared to hide for the long haul\" and may have reinforced the space himself. He was taken into custody without injury, and no weapons were recovered at the scene, though a further search of the residence is now underway.",
      "Authorities are still piecing together how Groves traveled from New Orleans to Atlanta, whether he received assistance and how long he had been in Georgia.",
      "\"I'd probably guess [he traveled by] car, but we don't know,\" Fair said. \"That's going to be part of the follow-up work that's going to be done now that he's in custody.\"",
      "Fair said Groves was believed to be a ringleader in the May 16 jailbreak from the Orleans Parish Justice Center, in which inmates pulled a jail cell door off its tracks, removed a toilet from an empty cell and crawled through a hole in the wall before scaling a fence. The brazen escape exposed design flaws and security failures in the 10-year-old jail, Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "All 10 escapees have now been captured.",
      "The U.S. Marshals credited a coalition of agencies \u2014 including the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, New Orleans Police Department, Louisiana State Police, Homeland Security Investigations, FBI and Atlanta Police \u2014 for their roles in the investigation.",
      "Fair also credited media coverage and public engagement for keeping attention on the case.",
      "\"He was bombarded on the news for months on end,\" Fair said. \"The media was a huge part of this capture. It kept him on the run and probably pretty tired all summer.\"",
      "Jail records in Fulton County, Georgia, show Groves was booked on fugitive from justice charges. Groves is expected to be extradited to Louisiana, where he will face additional charges related to the escape. Fair said Louisiana State Police are likely to lead that transfer.",
      "\"We're just happy nobody got injured,\" Fair said. \"All 10 of the escapees are back in custody, and we're proud of that success.\"",

      "Her tumultuous marriage to Kennedy, which began in 1958 and ended in 1982, made her an international celebrity. Her life post-divorce as a music scholar and performer and advocate on issues of addiction and mental health cemented her status as an important figure in American life.",
      "She was open and eloquent about her battles with alcoholism and depression in an era when celebrity confessionals were rare, and inspired the impactful post-politics career of her son Patrick, one of the nation's premiere crusaders for mental health services.",

This is somebody who is so insecure that he lashes out pretending that he can come arrest people for no reason at all. He can't. He isn't going to do it. TACO \u2013 Trump always chickens out.\"",

      "\"This president is absolutely out of control, and it's incumbent on all of us, if there was ever a time for working people to unite in this country, now is the time,\" Johnson said.",
      "Pritzker has vowed to use \"every lever\" at the state's disposal to resist the troop deployment.

      "\"It is striking fear in the hearts of everybody in Chicago, and we have residents \u2014 this isn't just about undocumented people,\" Pritzker said Tuesday night during a discussion in Minnesota with that state's governor, Tim Walz. \"U.S. citizens who are brown or Black are being stopped only for that reason, and asked for identification that proves they're a U.S. citizen.\"",
      "Both governors said they believe the Trump administration is targeting blue states.",
      "Pritzker is also calling for governors nationwide to denounce the National Guard deployments. In a statement on social media, he said Illinois could withdraw from the National Governors Association over the issue.",
      "\"If the National Governors Association chooses to remain silent, Illinois will have no choice but to withdraw from the organization,\" Pritzker wrote. \"We should be standing as one against the idea that Donald Trump can call up the National Guard against our will.\"",

As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump made substantial inroads in heavily Latino areas in New Jersey in 2024, but many have since soured on him and the GOP, a CBS News analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks to go, the New Jersey governor's race is tightening and garnering national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about President Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "New Jersey's Latino electorate is emerging as a potentially decisive voting bloc in the battle between Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Most independent polls show Sherrill leading with likely voters ahead of the election on Nov. 4, though generally just by single digits.",
      "Democrats are worried \u2014 national party sources tell CBS News that Sherrill \"needs help,\" and allies have begun to rally more support for her in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
      "\"We're jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it's a blue state and we may not need to act,\" says Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS Action Fund.",
      "The political arm of the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS, is expected to announce it's endorsing Sherrill on Wednesday, betting that Latinos could help decide this race.",
      "\"She's strong on housing, healthcare, and education which our community and Latino voters care a lot about, and she doesn't see Latinos as an afterthought,\" said Murguia, adding that 2025 has underscored the importance of a governor's role in fending off the Trump administration, citing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as examples.",
      "Sherrill, some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign. Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill's campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on \"kitchen table\" issues like inflation and cost of living.",
      "In the presidential election, Harris carried New Jersey with 52% of the vote, but Mr. Trump made significant inroads, especially among Latino communities.",
      "New Jersey's 9th Congressional District provides a stark illustration of the trend. Voters elected Democrat Nellie Pou to the U.S. House last year, but in an election-night surprise, Mr. Trump carried the district at the presidential level. For reference, former President Joe Biden carried it by 19 points in 2020. This is a heavily Latino district and one of just 13 districts across the country that backed Mr. Trump while electing a Democrat to the House.",
      "Mr. Trump made substantial inroads in other heavily Latino areas, too. For example, the working-class city of Paterson has a population that is over 60% Latino. Mr. Trump's share of the vote there nearly doubled between 2020 and 2024, cutting the Democratic margin in half. And Passaic, a city with a 70% Latino population, actually flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024. In both of these cities, his vote margin increased by over 30 points. He also flipped the county and became the first Republican to win the presidential vote in Passaic in over 30 years.",
      "While these shifts were partly due to Biden voters switching to Mr. Trump in 2024, they also occurred as a result of changes in turnout. New Jersey saw a decline in turnout rates from 2020 to 2024, and the drops were more pronounced among Latino voters and registered Democrats. Many Biden 2020 voters simply stayed home, helping explain why Harris' vote totals were much lower than Biden's in these communities, while Mr. Trump's actually rose slightly.",
      "The gaps in turnout between White voters and voters of color often increase in off-year elections, so a big question in 2025 is what turnout will look like in the state's ethnically diverse communities, like those in Passaic. That will shape the final vote margin between Sherill and Ciattarelli.",
      "While Republicans made inroads with Latinos in New Jersey and across the country last year, many have soured on Mr. Trump and the GOP.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. Today, CBS News polling indicates that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to the latest CBS News national survey, most Latinos rank either the economy / jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "In particular, Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially.",
      "Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",
      "These numbers suggest this may be why the Sherrill campaign is trying to link Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump as much as possible, as well as emphasizing the cost of living in the state. It remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to reverse recent trends by winning back some Biden-to-Trump Latinos and by giving their infrequent voters a reason to turn out this fall.",

Cloobeck, Steve Hilton, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa, Butch Ware, Betty Yee and Leo Zacky share their thoughts.",
    "story": [
      "California's controversial plan to redraw its congressional maps mid-decade is among the most pressing issues discussed by\u00a0candidates in the 2026 gubernatorial race.",
      "Xavier Becerra, Chad Bianco, Ian Calderon, Stephen J. Cloobeck, Steve Hilton, Katie Porter, Tony Thurmond, Antonio Villaraigosa, Butch Ware, Betty Yee and Leo Zacky shared their thoughts and where they stand on the issue.",
      "Proposition 50, placed on the ballot by the state legislature for a November special election, would authorize California lawmakers to redraw the state's congressional districts.",
      "The redistricting effort, backed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, is aimed at sending more Democrats to Congress by redrawing\u00a0five of the state's districts for U.S. House seats\u00a0to be more favorable to Democrats in next year's midterm elections. California Democrats call it a countermeasure to President Trump's push for\u00a0Texas' recent redistricting, which favors Republicans in the midterms.",
      "Unlike in Texas, California voters took the power to draw these maps away from lawmakers in 2020 and established an\u00a0independent redistricting commission.\u00a0Proposition 50 would give that power back to lawmakers for the next five years, through the next presidential election.",
      "Over several weeks in September, CBS News California Investigates sat down with each candidate to ask questions on a variety of issues that matter to voters, including Proposition 50.",
      "While Democratic candidates generally backed Proposition 50 along party lines, some admitted unease when pressed on the controversial partisan details. Republican and Green Party opponents defended their opposition as they responded to arguments in favor of the measure.",
      "What do you think of the governor's plan?",
      "Former Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who served as Health and Human Services Secretary in the Biden administration, defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington, saying it would \"make sure that Donald Trump doesn't put his thumb on the scale on the votes in Congress.\"",
      "Republican candidate Steve Hilton condemned the plan, saying outright that it is \"totally corrupt and it's unconstitutional and it is illegal.\"",
      "\"Politicians shouldn't draw their own maps,\" Hilton said. \"I mean, that's obviously wrong and corrupt. Common sense tells you that.\"",
      "Former state Assemblymember Ian Calderon, also a Democrat, said he supports the plan and emphasized California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"At the end of the day, if we're going to have hope of any type of leverage throughout the next couple of years during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress, so that we could fight back and secure the money that is coming to California,\" Calderon said.",
      "However, he acknowledged unease with the Democratic gerrymandering and noted that his wife vehemently opposed Prop 50. \u00a0\"She thinks that districts should be drawn by independent redistricting commissions and that it is wrong for the state to be putting its finger on the scale, Calderon said.",
      "Republican candidate Leo Zacky called the proposal \"unconstitutional,\" criticizing Democratic lawmakers for redrawing the independent redistricting commission's maps for their own partisan purposes.",
      "\"The way that it's set up is that we, the people, are supposed to figure out how the districts are supposed to be drawn,\" he said. \"[Newsom is] violating the Constitution. He's spending a ton of money doing it. It's trash. It's a waste.\"",
      "Green Party candidate Butch Ware accused Democrats of consolidating power under the guise of fighting Republican overreach.",
      "\"In the state of California, are y'all feeling that this has been a state that has been well-run and for your best interest? So you're going to essentially hand them the keys to make sure that they own every district in the state? You imagine thinking that you can fight fascism with fascism,\" Ware said.",
      "While Democratic former State Controller Betty Yee called the redistricting effort \"essential\" to prevent the manipulation of elections, \"as the president has asked the state of Texas to do.\"",
      "\"We have a process for this. It's after every decennial census\u2026 And just the idea that there is manipulation that is being directed from the top, that's going to affect California's representation, our proportionate representation,\" Yee said. \"We have to fight that.\"",
      "Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, who is running as a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is California's opportunity to counter \"gerrymandering coming out of states like Texas.\"",
      "\"Not only will it give voters something better and the chance to gain five new Democratic seats. We're doing it in a way that is transparent,\" he said. \"We're going to do it in a way that lets the voters decide.\"",
      "Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, also a Democrat, said the redistricting effort is a necessary response to Republican attempts to rig elections elsewhere.",
      "\"Let the people decide, and I'm for it. I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" Villaraigosa said.",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck, a Democrat, supported the plan and said \"we have to preserve Democracy.\" Another Democrat, Katie Porter, who's a law professor and former member of Congress, said she is in \"support of the governor's plan.\"",
      "Republican Sheriff Chad Bianco of Riverside County expressed opposition.",
      "\"It's like saying murder is not acceptable, so I'm going to go murder you,\" Bianco said. \"Let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more.\"",
      "Message to Californians who voted for Trump",
      "The Democratic candidates also explained their message   to the roughly 40% of California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, voters whose political representation could be diminished under the new district maps.",
      "Becerra said he would talk to them \"straight out\" and emphasized his intention to win every vote. Becerra also emphasized that now is the time to stand up for the rule of law and Democracy.",
      "\"No one should do power grabs. No one is a king. No one has a right to deny you your vote,\" he said.",
      "Like Becerra, Calderon said his campaign would focus on listening to all voters, not just talking at them.",
      "\"There are a lot of Republicans in the state who don't necessarily love everything Trump is doing,\" Calderon said. \"They just want to be heard.\"",
      "Thurmond echoed similar arguments, saying that many of Mr. Trump's voters may not support all of the president's policies.",
      "\"Most Americans do not support attacks on the immigrant communities or education cuts,\" he said. \"Just because they voted for Trump doesn't mean they agree with everything.\"",
      "Yee acknowledged that some voters, particularly in rural Republican districts, may feel disenfranchised.",
      "\"What I will say to them also is, look, these are areas of the state that actually want to become vital economies. These are areas that actually have probably disproportionate rates of people on Medicaid. These are parts of the states where people are relying on food assistance more than probably other parts,\" Yee said. \"I would just say, who's going to best represent those interests when those cuts are upon you?\"",
      "Businessman Steve Cloobeck emphasized loyalty to California's interests rather than party politics.",
      "\"I would look at the polls of the state right now. The polls say protect California. Whatever the California customers want, I will be their leader and represent them,\" Cloobeck said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he expects to alienate some voters on both sides, but believes many are still looking for leadership that bridges divides.",
      "\"I know there are Democrats that I might alienate in the course of this race, and there will be Republicans I alienate. There will also be Democrats and some Republicans that want a leader who's a uniter who wants to work with both sides, who wants the focus on common sense. So you win a few, you lose a few.\"",
      "Porter, who has represented a swing district in Orange County, was the only candidate\u00a0to refuse to directly answer the question, taking issue with the premise that she might need Republican voters to win.",
      "\"How would I need them in order to win?\" Porter asked. \"If it is me versus a Republican, I think that I will win the people who did not vote for Trump.\"",
      "As several of her opponents noted, in\u00a0California's top-two open primary\u00a0system, Republican voters could help put a Democratic candidate over the top.",
      "Porter then threatened to call off the interview, taking issue with too many follow-up questions. She ultimately stayed and continued answering questions.",
      "The Republican and Green Party Proposition 50 opponents also defended their opposition to pro-redistricting arguments.",
      "Do two wrongs make a right?",
      "The candidates also confronted the ethical dilemma\u00a0that even some Prop 50 supporters acknowledge: Does fighting one partisan maneuver with another set the wrong precedent? In other words, do two wrongs make right?",
      "\"It's let me tell you how broken something is by telling you I'm going to break it more,\" Bianco said.",
      "Becerra defended the plan as necessary to protect California's voice in Washington.",
      "\"Donald Trump is afraid he's going to lose his slim majority of Republicans come 2026,\" Becerra said. \"So he's trying to rig the process to give himself more Republicans. That is not a Democratic process. We're going to fight as we need to make sure our votes count.\"",
      "Calderon offered a conflicted view, calling it \"kind of a sh---- choice\" but emphasizing the political stakes.",
      "\"If we're going to have hope of any type of leverage during Donald Trump's presidency, it would be really helpful if Democrats controlled Congress.\"",
      "Ware warned voters not to fall for partisan manipulation.",
      "\"This doesn't serve the voters of California. It serves the DNC. It does not help us. It helps them,\" Ware said. \"They are using Californians essentially as a prop in their battle between Democrats and Republicans.\"",
      "Porter said it's not two wrongs, highlighting the nature in which Texas approached its redistricting.",
      "\"What Texas is doing is acting out of the course of the census, not following new census data\u2026 They're doing it because Donald Trump instructed them to do it,\" she said.",
      "Villaraigosa said he's for letting the people decide on the matter to challenge corruption.",
      "\"I think people have a right to challenge what's going on, this rigged election that they're trying to do,\" he said.",
      "Thurmond called the special election on Proposition 50 \"an important moment for voters to decide.\"",
      "Yee reaffirmed her stance on California's move to counter Texas' redistricting effort.",
      "\"Just the idea that there's manipulation that is being directed from the top that's going to affect California's proportionate representation, we have to fight back,\" she said.",
      "Cloobeck also highlighted California's position as a donor state.",
      "\"Donald Trump's actions have been such that he wants to just attack California. He has not shown us any gratitude for all the billions of dollars of tax dollars the federal government gets from California,\" he said.",
      "Hilton described the difficulty California faces in properly redrawing its congressional districts mid-decade rather than after the federal census every 10 years.",
      "\"By drawing these maps in the middle, they don't know who lives where,\" he said. \"Millions of people have left California. In Los Angeles, whole communities have burned down. Who knows who lives there? There's no way that they can honor that constitutional requirement.\"",
      "Hilton stressed that even before Newsom's redistricting effort, California already had \"a massively distorted political map.\"",
      "Acknowledging that Republicans make up about 40% of the vote in California but have just 17% of the congressional seats, Hilton said, \"With this new plan that they've got, it would be down to 6%.\"",
      "Hilton argued that those voters are being pushed out of representation altogether, saying that the plan would unfairly increase the weight of Democratic votes by as much as eight times compared to Republican ones.",
      "\"We're completely violating the principle of equal protection, the whole idea,\" Hilton said.",
      "While candidates differ sharply on Proposition 50, voters will have the final say. The redistricting plan will go before voters in a special election on November 4. If approved, the new congressional maps would remain intact through the 2028 presidential election, until 2030.",

      "Tokyo \u2014 An agitated bear roamed the aisles of a grocery store in central Japan, injuring two men and frightening shoppers, officials said Wednesday, while Japanese media said a man was found dead after a separate suspected bear mauling.",
      "More and more wild bears have been spotted in Japan in recent years, even in residential areas, due to factors including a declining human population and climate change.",
      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",
      "Also on Tuesday, a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, just outside his house.",
      "A Spanish tourist on Sunday was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in scenic Shirakawa-go village in central Japan.",
      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals.",

      "Stockholm\u00a0\u2014 John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for research on seemingly obscure quantum tunneling that is advancing digital technology.",
      "Clarke, 83, conducted his research at the University of California, Berkeley; Martinis at the University of California, Santa Barbara; and Devoret at Yale and also at the University of California, Santa Barbara.",
      "\"To put it mildly, it was the surprise of my life,\" Clarke told reporters at the announcement by phone after being told of his win.",
      "He paid tribute to the other two laureates, saying that \"their contributions are just overwhelming.\"",

      "\"Our discovery in some ways is the basis of quantum computing. Exactly at this moment where this fits in is not entirely clear to me.\"",
      "However, speaking from his cellphone, Clarke added: \"One of the underlying reasons that cellphones work is because of all this work.''",
      "The Nobel committee said that the laureates' work in the 1980s continues to provide opportunities to develop \"the next generation of quantum technology, including quantum cryptography, quantum computers, and quantum sensors.\"",
      "\"It is wonderful to be able to celebrate the way that century-old quantum mechanics continually offers new surprises. It is also enormously useful, as quantum mechanics is the foundation of all digital technology,\" said Olle Eriksson, Chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics.",
      "The 100-year-old field of quantum mechanics deals with the seemingly impossible subatomic world where switches can be on and off at the same time and parts of atoms tunnel through what seems like impenetrable barriers. The prize winning trio's work helped take that into the larger world, where it has the potential to supercharge computing and communications.",
      "What the three physicists did \"is taking the scale of something that we can't see, we can't touch, we can't feel and bringing it up to the scale of something recognizable and make it something you can build upon,\" said Physics Today editor-in-chief Richard Fitzgerald, who in the 1990s worked in the field on a competitors' group.",
      "\"Quantum computers is one very sort of obvious use, but they're also can be used for quantum sensors, so to be able to make very sensitive measurements of, for example, magnetic fields, and perhaps also for cryptography, so to encode information so it cannot be easily listened to by a third party,\" Mark Pearce, a professor of astrophysics and Nobel Physics Committee member, told The Associated Press.",
      "It is the 119th time the prize has been awarded. Last year, artificial intelligence pioneers John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton won the physics prize for helping create the building blocks of machine learning.",
      "On Monday, Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for discoveries about how the immune system knows to attack germs and not our bodies.",
      "Nobel announcements continue with the chemistry prize on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in economics on Oct. 13.",
      "The award ceremony will be held Dec. 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and the inventor of dynamite who founded the prizes.",

      "Brunkow got the news of her prize from an AP photographer who came to her home in the early hours of the morning.",
      "She said she had ignored the earlier call from the Nobel committee. \"My phone rang and I saw a number from Sweden and thought: 'That's just, that's spam of some sort.'\"",
      "\"When I told Mary she won, she said, 'don't be ridiculous,'\" said her husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\"It was a nice surprise,\" Sakaguchi told a news conference from the University of Osaka in western Japan. \"I hope researches into the area will further progress so that our findings can be used in treatment, and I hope we can contribute to that as well.\"",
      "The immune system has many overlapping systems to detect and fight bacteria, viruses and other bad actors. Key immune warriors such as T cells get trained on how to spot bad actors. If some instead go awry in a way that might trigger autoimmune diseases, they're supposed to be eliminated in the thymus \u2014 a process called central tolerance.",
      "The Nobel winners unraveled an additional way the body keeps the system in check.",
      "The Nobel Committee said it started with Sakaguchi's discovery in 1995 of a previously unknown T cell subtype now known as regulatory T cells or T-regs. Then in 2001, Brunkow and Ramsdell discovered a culprit mutation in a gene named Foxp3, a gene that also plays a role in a rare human autoimmune disease.",
      "The Nobel Committee said two years later, Sakaguchi linked the discoveries to show that the Foxp3 gene controls the development of those T-regs \u2014\u00a0which in turn act as a security guard to find and curb other forms of T cells that overreact.",
      "Brunkow said she and Ramsdell were working together at a small biotech company and they were investigating why a particular strain of mice had an over-active immune system. They had to work with brand new techniques to find the mouse gene behind the problem \u2014 but quickly realized it could be a major player in human health, too.",
      "\"From a DNA level, it was a really small alteration that caused this massive change to how the immune system works.\"",
      "The work opened a new field of immunology, said Karolinska Institute rheumatology professor Marie Wahren-Herlenius. Researchers around the world now are working to use regulatory T cells to develop treatments for autoimmune diseases and cancer.",

    "story": [
      "The moon will appear slightly larger and brighter Monday night during what's known as a supermoon.",
      "October's supermoon is the first of three this year. It happens when a full moon is closer to Earth in its orbit. That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA. The subtle difference happens a few times a year, sometimes coinciding with other astronomical events such as lunar eclipses.",
      "\"It's not really very unusual,\" said Derrick Pitts, chief astronomer with the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia.",
      "Everyone in the world can see a supermoon without special equipment, if the skies are clear. But the difference can be tough to discern, especially if people haven't observed the regular moon on the nights leading up.",
      "\"If you go out and just look at the moon when it's very high in the sky, there is nothing relative to it to give you an idea of how big it looks,\" Pitts said.",
      "In the latest viewing, the moon will pass within about 224,600 miles of Earth. The closest supermoon of the year is slated for November, followed by another in December.",
      "The spectacles continue in 2026 with two lunar eclipses: a total eclipse across much of North America, Asia and Australia in March, and a partial one in August across the Americas, Africa and Europe.",
      "Why does the moon appear bigger and brighter during a supermoon?",
      "Like Earth's orbit around the Sun, the moon's orbit around Earth is elliptical, or oval-shaped. This means it's positioned at different distances from the planet depending on the time of the month. The distances range from about 226,000 miles and 251,000 miles, according to NASA.",
      "When the moon is hovering around one of those closer distances along its path in orbit, and there's also a full moon, it becomes a supermoon. The proximity to Earth can make the moon appear bigger to skywatchers on the ground. Sunlight reflecting off the moon can also appear brighter, NASA says.",
      "Supermoons only happen three or four times a year, since the moon's closeness to Earth rarely coincides with monthly full moons. They aren't identical, either. Astronomers generally consider a full moon to be \"super\" if the moon's position in orbit is at least 90% of the distance from its farthest point to Earth in the ellipse to its closest. The absolute closest point\u00a0is called the perigee.",

      "The XQ-58 blasts off like a rocket, but a full-scale model took off from a runway for the first time in August.",
      "General Adrian Spain, head of Air Combat Command, is drawing up plans for operating AI-piloted drones alongside manned aircraft. \"You've told them to go out in front and to execute an attack on a complex set of targets, and they will do that,\" Spain said.",
      "He says AI drones are capable of doing that today \u2013 and those drones could be armed with weapons.",
      "An AI-piloted F-16 has already held its own in a limited dogfight against an experienced fighter pilot. At Top Gun AI, other F-16s are being rewired for more realistic combat. Those aircraft still have a cockpit, and a pilot, who can engage the plug-and-play AI system, and then remain on board as a safety pilot.",
      "\"So, once the AI goes on, the hands come off?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yep, they'll be monitoring the system and ready to take over at a moment's notice,\" McMullen said. \"But we'll also have real live aircraft out there for it to fight against. Those jets will be piloted by real fighter pilots trying their best to outsmart the AI.\"",
      "So, are we witnessing a revolution?",
      "\"If we continue down this path, it has the potential to be a revolution,\" said Spain.",
      "\"You actually can take more risk\"",
      "Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Clint Hinote says it is a revolution born of necessity: \"The Air Force was so good for so long that it didn't need to change. Now it needs to change, and it's trying to figure out how.\"",
      "Change because the Chinese air force, which recently \u00a0showcased its newest jet fighters and its own AI drone, could be more than a match for the U.S. Air Force. According to Hinote, \"If we have to fight China, we're likely doing it in their front yard, and that means they can bring many, many more things to bear than we can, because it's so far away. You're having to achieve kill ratios of 10 to 1, 15 to 1, and 20 to 1 to even stay in the game.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do these war games come out when American pilots are going up against 20 to 1 odds?\"",
      "\"The war games don't turn out very well,\" Hinote replied. \"We lose.\"",
      "The Air Force is counting on AI drones to even the odds, by bringing to an aircraft what a human pilot doesn't. McMullen said, \"The big thing with artificial intelligence is the ability to handle large amounts of data. A human out in a complex air combat environment, there's just no way to absorb all of it. Artificial intelligence might be able to take all of the data information, and then process that very quickly, and then make real-time decisions.\"",
      "AI drones will be about half the length of a manned jet fighter, and one-quarter the cost \u2013 $20 to 30 million each. Hinote said, \"You could buy more airplanes, put them in the field, and still not break the bank. The key would be that you don't have to bring the human operator home; you actually can take more risk.\"",
      "Spain says the Air Force expects to have 150 AI-piloted aircraft by the end of the decade, and eventually up to 1,000.",
      "I asked, \"These drones aren't just going to sit in a hangar waiting for war with China. What are they going to do in peacetime?\"",
      "\"It's pretty wide open,\" Spain replied.",
      "\"Could you send up AI drones to intercept those Russian bombers that come down off the coast of Alaska?\"",
      "\"Yes, you could do that,\" he said.",
      "Those intercepts can turn nasty in an instant. Last year a Russian fighter rocked an American F-16, so AI drones would have to be prepared to shoot.",
      "So, is AI going to be making life-or-death decisions? \"Absolutely not,\" said Spain. \"Absolutely not. The human who's controlling the AI will make the life-and-death decisions.\"",
      "At least for now.",
      "Making life-or-death decisions",
      "Hinote said, \"Increasingly militaries around the world, including the United States military, are going to be pressured to give the machines more leeway in making those life-or-death decisions.\"",
      "Including the capability to fire on their own? \"The United States military is investing in the experimentation that you would need to be able to produce the types of platforms that could fire on their own if you gave them that option,\" Hinote said.",
      "If adversaries let AI make those decisions, what happens? \"I think they do so at their own peril,\" said Spain. \"Because the AI can be fooled, the AI can be overwhelmed. It can give you false outcomes. We've seen that AI can hallucinate. So, it's not a guarantee of success. What it guarantees is that it will do something quickly.\"",
      "\"Don't you at least have to give your pilots that option?\" I asked.",
      "\"To go full autonomy and just let it go? I don't think America is comfortable with that yet,\" Spain replied. \"I'm not saying that couldn't be a future world that we live in where we trust it. But I don't think we're there right now, certainly, and certainly not to start. We have to build that trust over time.\"",
      "At Top Gun AI, pilots keep putting in the reps, test flight after test flight, simulation after simulation, to build that trust.",
      "Asked whether he would rather go into combat with a human wingman or an AI wingman, McMullen replied, \"When we're talking about the threats of tomorrow, if I can send an uncrewed asset into a high-risk environment, I'd rather do that than send a human pilot.\"",

      "\"We created the App Store to be a safe and trusted place to discover apps,\" Apple said in a statement. \"Based on information we've received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock, we have removed it and similar apps from the App Store.\"",

      "\"We reached out to Apple today demanding they remove the ICEBlock app from their App Store \u2014 and Apple did so,\" Bondi said. \"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed. This Department of Justice will continue making every effort to protect our brave federal law enforcement officers, who risk their lives every day to keep Americans safe.\"",
      "ICEBlock is one of a number of apps designed to let users track and anonymously report immigration agents.

      "The probe by the agency's Office of Defects Investigation involves Tesla vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised)\" and \"FSD (Beta)\" versions of the the company's self-driving systems. Both require \"a fully attentive driver who is engaged in the driving task at all times,\" NHTSA said in a document filed as part of the probe.",

      "NHTSA has received reports of 58 safety violations linked to Tesla vehicles with FSD. Those incidents include more than a dozen crashes and fires, along with 23 injuries, according to the agency.",
      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "Such problems have led lawmakers and safety regulators to question whether Tesla's automated system and other like it will ever be able to operate safely on a widespread scale. A new law in California that would hold driverless car companies accountable for traffic violations is set to\u00a0take effect next year.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \"summon\" technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",

      "Roberson's defense contends that he has spent 22 years on death row as an innocent man.",

      "The 2013 law allows a person convicted of a crime to seek relief if the evidence used against them is no longer credible.",
      "Roark was convicted of injury to a child in 2000 and sentenced to 35 years in prison based on a shaken baby syndrome diagnosis. Last year, the Court of Criminal Appeals sent Roark's case back to the trial court due to the new research surrounding shaken baby syndrome. The next month, the Dallas County District Attorney exonerated Roark.",

      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "Standard deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",

      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is.",
      "For instance, a married couple with $150,000 in gross income would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%. However, their effective tax rate is much lower:",

      "On the forecast track, Jerry's center is expected to pass near or northeast of the northern Leeward Islands later today and tonight, the hurricane center noted. It wasn't\u00a0posing any threat to southern Florida.",
      "\"Through Friday,\" the center said, \"two to four 4 inches of rain with local storm total maxima to six inches are expected across the Leeward and Virgin Islands. This rainfall brings a risk of flash flooding, especially in urban areas and in steep terrain.\"",
      "What's more, \"Swells generated by Jerry are beginning to reach the Leeward and Windward Islands. These swells will spread westward toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico tonight, then toward the rest of the Greater Antilles over the next couple of days. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\"",
      "Hurricanes this season",
      "Jerry strengthened into a tropical storm Tuesday and is the 10th named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. It developed on the heels of several Atlantic storms, including Hurricane Humberto and Hurricane Imelda, which emerged at the end of September. Concerns that both could strike Bermuda briefly circulated, but only Imelda ultimately brushed the coast of the island as a Category 2 hurricane before quickly weakening on its way out to the open ocean.",
      "Humberto and Imelda also hit the southeastern United States with destructive surf, causing multiple coastal homes in North Carolina's Outer Banks to collapse.",
      "This has been a relatively quiet hurricane season, which typically runs annually from June 1 to Nov. 30 in the Atlantic. While Jerry is the 10th named storm this year, just one of the nine others \u2014 Chantal \u2014 actually made landfall in the U.S.",
      "When the current season began, an outlook released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration indicated that between 13 and 19 named storms would form in the Atlantic, with up to nine becoming hurricanes and as many as five strengthening into powerful Category 5 storms. But, as the months progressed, NOAA revised its outlook in August to predict that 13 to 18 named storms would form, including five to nine hurricanes.",

      "Anthony Boyd, 53, has been on death row in Alabama for the last three decades. He was convicted in 1995 of capital murder and kidnapping in the death of George Huguley, and a jury voted 10-2 to recommend that he receive the death penalty.",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of Wednesday's\u00a0government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on Tuesday posted a banner in large type on its homepage blaming the shutdown on the \"Radical Left,\" an allegation that an ethics group said was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act.",
      "\"The Radical Left are going to shut down the government and inflict massive pain on the American people unless they get their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands,\" the message read. \"The Trump administration wants to keep the government open for the American people.\"",
      "A complaint filed Tuesday with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Public Citizen alleged that the banner on HUD's website was a \"blatant violation\" of the Hatch Act, describing it as \"highly partisan\" and seeking to \"idolize the Trump administration \u2026 without attributing any blame for the lack of compromise causing the shutdown.\"",
      "The Hatch Act is a federal law passed in 1939 that \"limits certain political activities of federal employees as well as some state, D.C., and local government employees who work in connection with federally funded programs,\" according to the Office of Special Counsel.",
      "Its purpose, among other things, is to \"ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion,\" the office explains.",
      "\"This is such an obvious violation of the Hatch Act that it raises the question: 'How on Earth does HUD think they can get away with this?'\" Craig Holman, a government ethics expert with Public Citizen, who filed the complaint on behalf of his group, said in a statement. \"The answer is that the Trump administration has managed to neuter the ethics enforcement offices in the executive branch. Those who are responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act \u2014 namely, the Office of Special Counsel, followed by the Office of Government Ethics and the Attorney General's office \u2014 have all been taken over by Trump loyalists or those who are intimidated by Trump.\"",
      "\"The sheer crassness of this partisan advertisement by HUD using taxpayer dollars to campaign against Democrats and promote the Trump administration is going to make it exceedingly difficult for even a neutered ethics office to ignore,\" Holman added.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency that is designed to enforce the Hatch Act, investigate wrongdoing within the executive branch and protect whistleblowers from retaliation.",
      "\"Instead of agreeing to a clean funding extension, Democrats are planning a government shutdown over their $1.5 trillion wish list of demands, like free health care for illegal aliens,\" White House spokesperson Davis Ingle told CBS News in a statement Wednesday regarding the complaint. \"The Democrats petty political games are unnecessarily hurting the most vulnerable Americans in our society. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a Democrat shutdown on the American people?\"",
      "An HUD spokesperson told CBS News in another statement Wednesday that the \"Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans. At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable.\"",
      "And in a separate statement provided later Wednesday, HUD spokeswoman Kasey Lovett said that the \"Radical Left has shut down the government. As a result, HUD's Office of Public Affairs is operating in a limited capacity, which impacts our ability to promptly engage with the mainstream media. Once the government is reopened, we look forward to being back in touch.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Trump fired Special Counsel Hampton Dellinger, the head of OSC, and replaced him with acting Special Counsel Jamieson Greer. Dellinger sued over the firing, but it was upheld by a federal appeals court. Since returning to office, Mr. Trump has fired more than a dozen federal inspectors general who are tasked with investigating wrongdoing at government agencies.",
      "The shutdown, which took effect at 12 a.m. Wednesday, came after the Senate failed to push through a short-term funding bill that passed the House earlier this month.",
      "Democrats have called for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits passed in 2021 for those receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, as well as a rollback of Medicaid cuts that were part of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" that passed this summer.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have argued that the \"big, beautiful bill\" did not cut Medicaid, but instead that it eliminated fraud within the program.",
      "\"We're not cutting Medicaid,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in June, prior to the passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\" \"What we're doing is strengthening the program. We're reducing fraud, waste and abuse that is rampant in Medicaid to ensure that that program is essential for so many people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties cast blame on the other over the shutdown. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday night that \"Republicans have until midnight to cut the garbage and get serious,\" while Senate Majority Leader John Thune called the shutdown \"totally avoidable,\" adding that \"if the government shuts down, it is on the Senate Democrats.\"",

      "As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ...

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.

      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",

The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "summary": "Photos of Jeffrey Epstein's cell show a scene of disarray that never underwent a proper inspection, according to experts.",
    "story": [
      "The federal investigation into the death of convicted sex-trafficker Jeffrey Epstein was marred by significant lapses, experts told CBS News, including the failure by investigators to interview potential witnesses, properly preserve certain evidence and run basic forensic tests.",
      "Nearly two years passed before investigators interviewed the two key corrections officers on duty the night Epstein died in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown New York City, in what was later ruled a suicide, according to court documents. One of those officers was the only person to attest to seeing Epstein hanging by a bedsheet from his bunk.",
      "And details pulled from 90 photos of the cell and other evidence collected in the hours after Epstein's death \u2014 but before FBI agents arrived to process the scene \u2014 appear to show a succession of basic oversights, ranging from an absence of evidence markers to items being moved, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The FBI literally has all of the best tools. I mean, spared no expense. They have every tool you can imagine. And they used none of it as far as we can tell,\" forensic analyst Nick Barreiro said after reviewing the photos, many of which have never been published. \"How are there not way more people pointing out the absurdity of this?\"",
      "The images were previously obtained by 60 Minutes. After the recent release of surveillance video from the night Epstein died, which appeared to show details that contradicted official reports, CBS News reviewed them and other documents with several forensic experts.",
      "The results of the federal investigation were made public in 2023, four years after Epstein's death, in a report by the Department of Justice Office of Inspector General. It concluded that the financier, who entered a guilty plea in 2008 on state-level charges of procuring a child for prostitution, died by suicide. That matched the findings shared by Attorney General William Barr, who told Congress in August he had no doubts that Epstein had taken his own life. But lingering questions, raised by individuals including Epstein's lawyers and brother, have fueled continued speculation and suspicion.",
      "\"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Epstein's co-defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, said this summer during her interview in August with the Deputy U.S. Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Epstein's brother, Mark, told \"60 Minutes\" in 2020 that, in his view, the evidence he has seen to date points more to murder than suicide. Five years later, he still questions the investigation.",
      "\"This was never properly investigated as a proper homicide, it was never investigated,\" Mark Epstein told CBS News recently.",
      "Nothing about the CBS News review into the investigation of Epstein's death suggests foul play. But the review found that the federal probe did not follow typical investigative procedures into a suspicious death.",
      "\"Evidence photography 101\"",
      "Epstein's body was discovered at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10, 2019 by corrections officer Michael Thomas when he arrived at his cell to deliver breakfast. Thomas said he found the accused felon in a near-seated position, suspended from the top of the bunk by a homemade noose, with his legs straight out and his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 and a half inches off the floor, according to the inspector general's report. Internal corrections department memos obtained exclusively by CBS News described him as \"cold,\" with \"no palpable pulses.\"",
      "The first FBI agents arrived at the cell more than seven hours later, at 1:35 p.m., according to the 2023 report. But when they arrived, photos show they found a disorganized, rifled-through clutter. Crucially, Epstein's lifeless body had already been removed from the cell, eliminating a critical source of information investigators would need to determine how and when he died, forensic pathologist Michael Baden said.",
      "\"The fact that he was moved diminishes the ability to determine how long he was dead before he was found,\" Baden said.",
      "Emergency medical technicians wrote in their report on the incident, which was obtained by CBS News, that the staff they interacted with could not say when Epstein was last seen alive or describe how he \"was found in [the] jail cell other than to say 'we found him on the ground.'\"",
      "Inside the cell, piles of linens had been strewn about, mattresses were squeezed into a corner on the floor near his bunk bed and Epstein's personal items were rearranged or moved, photos from the scene show. Experts who reviewed photos of the scene for CBS News said there were also inconsistencies between the investigators' official reports and what the images show.",
      "\"In those photographs, it was obvious that things were moved around,\" said former New York Police Department detective Herman Weisberg, who is now managing director of Sage Intelligence. \"It definitely appeared to me that the scene was, for lack of a better term, staged a bit.\"",
      "Epstein's medications, a special mask for treating sleep apnea, and at least one piece of fabric tied into a noose appeared in different places over the course of 90 minutes, when a photographer from the medical examiner's office was documenting the scene.",
      "Weisberg and other experts emphasized that, regardless of whether Epstein's death was a suicide, the cell should have been treated as a crime scene using standard investigatory practices.",
      "\"It almost appears to me that whoever was investigating this just took it at face value that it was a suicide with no foul play whatsoever, suspected,\" Weisberg said. \"But in a situation as high-profile as this, I would always, as an investigator, consider that there might be foul play.\"",
      "While some experts questioned federal investigators' treatment of the scene, forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who used to work at the New York City Medical Examiner's office, said her former employer appears to have handled the case by the book.",
      "\"It's just people doing what they normally do for any other case,\" Melinek said. \"The majority of [cases] if you weren't such a high profile decedent, the scrutiny would not apply. This is how they treat every other jail death of somebody who is not high profile.\"",
      "The sequence of evidence photos starts with a picture of the stairs leading up to Epstein's cellblock, Tier L. Underlying data from the photo shows it was taken at 9:34 a.m. \u2014 three hours after Epstein's body was found, and four hours before federal investigators arrived.",
      "Time went by even as the nation's top law enforcement officer sought a rapid investigation.",
      "\"I was obviously covering it very quickly and wanted to rule out anything other than suicide,\" Barr told Congress in August, adding that \"within an hour, or minutes of finding out about it, I directed the [inspector general] to have people in New York go to the scene and conduct an investigation.\"",
      "On the back wall, a surveillance camera is visible. It was streaming, but was not recording. This was due to a hard-drive malfunction that had previously been identified but not fixed, according to a Justice Department report.",
      "Next is a blurry image of the door to Epstein's cell, number 220. Running underneath the door was a cable that provided power to a CPAP machine. Epstein had initially been assigned to a cell in a different tier, but he was moved to cell 220 for easier access to an outlet, according to Bureau of Prisons records.",
      "The jail's computer systems were never updated to note that move, according to investigators. A source close to the investigation told CBS News that corrections staff rarely updated internal inmate moves, instead preferring to call out their names while in the tiers.",
      "Two documents on the door are shown in images after Epstein's death. One was a printout with Epstein's personal details and a booking photo. Above that was the ID card for Epstein's former roommate, Efrain Reyes.",
      "Cells typically hold two inmates, and following a suspected suicide attempt two weeks earlier, Epstein was mandated by correction officials to have a cellmate. The day before Epstein's death, however, Reyes was transferred out of the detention center. Investigators eventually concluded that Reyes' move allowed Epstein the solitude needed to kill himself.",
      "From the first photo to the last, it is clear the scene in the cell was chaotic \u2014 so much so that investigators never conclusively determined which strip of bedsheet was around Epstein's neck when he died.",
      "Photos of the bed also raise questions. One shows an orange string hanging from a bar. This picture was included in a 2023 report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, alongside a description of how Epstein was found, suggesting investigators believed that was what he had used to hang himself.",
      "If that was the case, and the room hadn't been disturbed before the photographer arrived, Epstein's rear would have come to rest on a mattress, instead of hovering over the floor \u2014 complicating investigators' explanation of how he hanged himself.",
      "Some of the evidence was not photographed in Epstein's cell, but instead appeared to be in an entirely different room \u2014 one with floor tiles distinct from the bare concrete of Epstein's cell. These pictures show a defibrillator and another strip of orange cloth tied into a noose-like shape. It is visibly different from the one shown hanging from Epstein's bed frame.",
      "There is no indication in official reports where this noose was found, or which of several knotted strips of bed linen may have been removed from around Epstein's neck. A rendering of this noose was included in Epstein's official autopsy. But the Justice Department later revealed in its 2023 report that \"the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.\"",
      "By the time FBI agents arrived, it was clear their work would be scrutinized by the top brass inside the Justice Department.",
      "\"After the suicide, I told the headquarters to make sure that they flooded the zone,\" Barr told Congress in an August deposition.",
      "There is no indication in any official report that an FBI crime scene investigators, officially known as an Evidence Response Team, ever ran fingerprints or DNA tests on anything found in the cell.",
      "Epstein's autopsy report indicates medical examiners collected fingernail clippings, and swabs from his neck and hands. Epstein's brother Mark told CBS News that he still hasn't received any information about the results of DNA tests, if they were carried out, and Barr said in his deposition that he couldn't remember if they had been done.",
      "A 2024 report by Department of Justice researchers warned that investigators risk missing an important \"opportunity\" to gather evidence \"if DNA is not collected at the scene as needed or at the time of examination.\" They advised that \"body swabs should be considered both at the scene and during autopsy.\"",
      "Weisberg said investigators left too many stones unturned, missing the opportunity to close the case in a way that would feel conclusive to the public.",
      "\"In the back of any good investigator's mind, he's preparing this to be scrutinized by counsel. In this case, you're preparing it to be scrutinized by a lot of desktop detectives \u2026 so you better have all of your facts straight,\" Weisberg said.",
      "The FBI \"inspected the cell and retrieved what [they] believed to be relevant to its investigation into the cause of Epstein's death, which included one torn sheet, miscellaneous papers, and an MP3 player,\" inspector general investigators wrote in the 2023 report.",
      "Forensic analyst Barreiro said he considered the agency's treatment of the scene to be striking.",
      "\"Some really shoddy work here, if you can even call it that,\" Barreiro said. \"I mean there's an absence of work here.\"",
      "One basic procedure, which Barreiro referred to as \"evidence photography 101,\" is photographing scenes in a progression that goes from a wide shot to close-ups, with markers identifying evidence.",
      "\"There's no evidence markers in any of these photographs. Like, how do you keep track once you get the stuff back to the crime lab? This is essentially useless,\" said Barreiro, a former police detective and an FBI-trained member of the Digital Imaging and Video Recovery Team.",
      "Interviews",
      "Federal investigators questioned 54 people before issuing their final report, including three inmates who had been housed on Epstein's tier, as well as jail staff, administrators, contractors and his brother. However, several other witnesses or their representatives told CBS News they were not interviewed. That included many other inmates housed in Epstein's tier the night of his death, at least one staffer who arrived at Epstein's cell shortly after his body was found and nearly all of the visitors he saw in the days leading up to his death.",
      "Two witnesses who did provide eyewitness accounts, with their lawyers present, were in the cell directly across from Epstein's the night he died. One described seeing Thomas, the first corrections officer on scene, enter Epstein's cell and begin performing CPR, only to emerge holding a rope and a defibrillator. The other said he saw Thomas enter and shake Epstein. He said Thomas tried to pick Epstein up, but fell over. He then began giving chest compressions, the inmate said.",
      "The accounts, which appear in the official report, do not explain what is seen in photos of the jail tier \u2014 their cell windows covered by papers that could have obscured any view outside.",
      "It's not clear if the cell window was papered over in the time after Epstein's death but before the first photos were snapped. The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.",
      "Attempts to reach Thomas were unsuccessful. A lawyer for his former coworker, Tova Noel, said she would not comment. The former officers agreed to be interviewed by investigators in 2021, as part of a deal that saw prosecutors drop charges of falsifying records related to mandatory checks on Epstein and other inmates, after falling asleep on the job.",
      "Other staffers with first-hand knowledge of the scene and other events were never contacted by federal investigators, according to interviews with CBS News.",
      "Investigators also decided not to interview some of Epstein's visitors, several sources told CBS News. The inmate spent the bulk of his daylight hours with a large, rotating cast of attorneys \u2014 including on the day before his death. The younger lawyers were there not only to provide counsel , but also \"to basically hold his hand\" and \"babysit,\" according to one source. They kept Epstein company, chatting with him about life, politics, literature and any other topic that came to his mind.",
      "\"You'd think if the investigation was a priority, they'd want to take a run at the younger people who were working for him,\" one source told CBS News. \"Nothing.\"",
      "One lawyer who visited Epstein nine days before his death was David Schoen. He said Epstein told him he was actively planning to fight the criminal charges levied against him.",
      "\"And this is why I've said, that in my view \u2014 I don't have anything to base it on other than anecdotal \u2014 I don't think he committed suicide, because he was very engaged in the idea of fighting the case,\" Schoen said. \"He hired me. And to kill himself nine days later wouldn't have made a lot of sense.\"",
      "While many who were close to Epstein have publicly questioned that he died by suicide, Barr has said it was \u2014 and remains \u2014 the most logical conclusion. The alternative would've been too complicated, Barr said in his August deposition.",
      "\"This would've required coordination from probably two dozen people, maybe, within the prison. And all these people were in different groups,\" Barr said. \"You know, the people who were repairing the cameras, the people who, you know, were responsible for opening and closing the door, the people who were responsible for putting in a new cellmate, things like that. \"",

      "Terri Lesley was fired as the library system director in northeastern Wyoming's Campbell County in 2023, two years into the book dispute at the library in Gillette. Lesley sued last spring over her termination and reached the settlement with county officials Wednesday. She had been the director since 2012 and with the library 27 years, Wyoming Public Radio reported.",
      "\"I do feel vindicated. It's been a rough road, but I will never regret standing up for the First Amendment,\" Lesley said.",
      "A major coal-mining area on the Western high plains, Campbell County is among the most conservative areas in one of the most conservative states.",
      "Public officials there sided with the book objectors and violated Lesley's First Amendment rights, Lesley claimed in her federal lawsuit against Campbell County, including its commission and library board.",
      "\"Defendants continually subjected Ms. Lesley to a hostile work environment and ultimately terminated her because she refused to remove the books that a narrow subset of residents challenged for their LGBTQ+ themes and because she engaged with, welcomed, and did not discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals in access to [the library and its services],\" the original complaint alleges.",
      "The county denied Lesley's claims. Only Lesley's performance \u2014 not the dispute over the books \u2014 played a role in her dismissal, the county argued in court documents.",
      "A private-practice attorney hired by the county for the lawsuit, Patrick Holscher, and County Attorney Nathan Henkes didn't immediately return phone messages Wednesday seeking comment.",
      "The books objected to in Gillette included \"This Book is Gay\" by Juno Dawson, \"How Do You Make a Baby\" by Anna Fiske, \"Doing It\" by Hannah Witton, \"Sex is a Funny Word\" by Corey Silverberg, and \"Dating and Sex: A Guide for the 21st Century Teen Boy\" by Andrew P. Smiler.",
      "Lesley previously criticized the board for not being transparent about which books they wanted her to remove, Wyoming Public Radio reported.",
      "\"The board flatly refused to tell me which books they think should be moved even when I've questioned them, they have put the burden completely on me and not on them,\" Lesley said, according to Wyoming Public Radio. \"They are the ultimate authority on all that goes on at the library.\"",
      "\"We hope at least that it sends a message to other library districts, other states, other counties, that the First Amendment is alive and strong and that our values against discrimination also remain alive and strong,\" said Lesley's attorney, Iris Halpern. \"These are public entities, they're government officials, they need to keep in mind their constitutional obligations.\"",
      "Halpern and her firm, Rathod Mohamedbhai in Denver, have supported fired library employees elsewhere in recent years. Under the settlement agreement, Lesley is dropping her lawsuit, though a separate lawsuit she has filed against three individuals who contested the books will continue.",
      "The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency tasked with enforcing discrimination laws, allowed the lawsuit against the county officials to be filed based on an earlier EEOC complaint filed by Lesley.",

    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices.",

    "summary": "Trump made substantial inroads in heavily Latino areas in New Jersey in 2024, but many have since soured on him and the GOP, a CBS News analysis finds.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks to go, the New Jersey governor's race is tightening and garnering national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about President Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "New Jersey's Latino electorate is emerging as a potentially decisive voting bloc in the battle between Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who is backed by Mr. Trump.",
      "Most independent polls show Sherrill leading with likely voters ahead of the election on Nov. 4, though generally just by single digits.",
      "Democrats are worried \u2014 national party sources tell CBS News that Sherrill \"needs help,\" and allies have begun to rally more support for her in the closing weeks of the campaign.",
      "\"We're jumping right into this New Jersey race, despite a lot of folks thinking it's a blue state and we may not need to act,\" says Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS Action Fund.",
      "The political arm of the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, UnidosUS, is expected to announce it's endorsing Sherrill on Wednesday, betting that Latinos could help decide this race.",
      "\"She's strong on housing, healthcare, and education which our community and Latino voters care a lot about, and she doesn't see Latinos as an afterthought,\" said Murguia, adding that 2025 has underscored the importance of a governor's role in fending off the Trump administration, citing California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker as examples.",
      "Sherrill, some Democrats admit, has struggled with her message, which often echoes the playbook former Vice President Kamala Harris employed in her failed 2024 White House campaign. Several Democrats tell CBS News that Sherrill's campaign has yet to articulate a compelling economic message and has failed to sharpen the focus on \"kitchen table\" issues like inflation and cost of living.",
      "In the presidential election, Harris carried New Jersey with 52% of the vote, but Mr. Trump made significant inroads, especially among Latino communities.",
      "New Jersey's 9th Congressional District provides a stark illustration of the trend. Voters elected Democrat Nellie Pou to the U.S. House last year, but in an election-night surprise, Mr. Trump carried the district at the presidential level. For reference, former President Joe Biden carried it by 19 points in 2020. This is a heavily Latino district and one of just 13 districts across the country that backed Mr. Trump while electing a Democrat to the House.",
      "Mr. Trump made substantial inroads in other heavily Latino areas, too. For example, the working-class city of Paterson has a population that is over 60% Latino. Mr. Trump's share of the vote there nearly doubled between 2020 and 2024, cutting the Democratic margin in half. And Passaic, a city with a 70% Latino population, actually flipped to Mr. Trump in 2024. In both of these cities, his vote margin increased by over 30 points. He also flipped the county and became the first Republican to win the presidential vote in Passaic in over 30 years.",
      "While these shifts were partly due to Biden voters switching to Mr. Trump in 2024, they also occurred as a result of changes in turnout. New Jersey saw a decline in turnout rates from 2020 to 2024, and the drops were more pronounced among Latino voters and registered Democrats. Many Biden 2020 voters simply stayed home, helping explain why Harris' vote totals were much lower than Biden's in these communities, while Mr. Trump's actually rose slightly.",
      "The gaps in turnout between White voters and voters of color often increase in off-year elections, so a big question in 2025 is what turnout will look like in the state's ethnically diverse communities, like those in Passaic. That will shape the final vote margin between Sherill and Ciattarelli.",
      "While Republicans made inroads with Latinos in New Jersey and across the country last year, many have soured on Mr. Trump and the GOP.",
      "CBS News polling throughout the 2024 campaign pointed to dissatisfaction with the economy and rising prices as key drivers of voting decisions. Today, CBS News polling indicates that many voters are still unhappy with the direction of the country and the economy specifically.",
      "According to the latest CBS News national survey, most Latinos rank either the economy / jobs (26%) or inflation (25%) as the most important issue facing the country. Two-thirds of Latinos rate the national economy negatively. And Mr. Trump's job approval rating has slid to 38% among Latinos, from a high of 49% at the start of his term.",
      "In particular, Mr. Trump's approval rating on handling inflation has fallen to a 32% among Latinos, and majorities say his policies are costing the U.S. jobs and making them worse off financially.",
      "Nationwide, most Latinos now say whether or not they support him, they believe that Mr. Trump is not following through on the promises he made during his campaign.",
      "These numbers suggest this may be why the Sherrill campaign is trying to link Ciattarelli and Mr. Trump as much as possible, as well as emphasizing the cost of living in the state. It remains to be seen whether Democrats will be able to reverse recent trends by winning back some Biden-to-Trump Latinos and by giving their infrequent voters a reason to turn out this fall.",

      "The center cautioned that \"large swells generated by Priscilla are affecting the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur as well as portions of coastal southwestern and west-central Mexico.

    "story": [
      "The president of Colombia alleged Wednesday that a boat struck by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea last week carried Colombian citizens, a claim a White House official called \"baseless and reprehensible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has hit at least four alleged drug boats since last month, with the most recent known strike on Oct. 3 killing four \"narco-terrorists\" in a vessel off the coast of Venezuela, according to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The Trump administration argues the attacks are necessary to halt drug trafficking, but critics say the administration lacks legal approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "On Wednesday, Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X: \"Indications show that the last bombed boat was Colombian with Colombian citizens inside it.\"",
      "Petro did not specify the source of his information or why he believes the people on\u00a0the boat were Colombian citizens, though he said he hopes their families come forward. The U.S. military has not publicly identified the boat's passengers.",
      "The White House quickly denounced Petro's statement. A White House official told CBS News the U.S. \"looks forward to President Petro publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement so that we can return to a productive dialogue on building a strong, prosperous future for the people of [the] United States and Colombia.\"",
      "The White House official also described Colombia as an important U.S. partner despite \"policy differences with the current government.\"",
      "The first leftist elected president of Colombia in decades, Petro has periodically clashed with the Trump administration. He denounced the strikes on alleged drug boats in a speech before the United Nations last month, and days later, he encouraged members of the U.S. military to \"disobey\" Mr. Trump's orders during a New York protest \u2014 leading the State Department to announce it would revoke his visa. Meanwhile, the U.S. has accused his government of not cooperating on anti-drug trafficking efforts.",
      "Petro's most recent allegation adds to mounting scrutiny of the Trump administration's campaign of strikes against alleged drug-carrying vessels in the Caribbean.",
      "President Trump has cast the strikes as part of a broader gambit to combat drug smuggling and stem the flow of deadly narcotics into the U.S. His administration has designated several cartels and Latin American gangs as terrorist organizations, and since August, several U.S. Navy vessels have been stationed in the Caribbean as part of an anti-cartel mission \u2014 drawing stiff backlash from the Venezuelan government.",
      "\"Every one of those boats is responsible for the death of 25,000 American people and the destruction of families,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech in Virginia marking the Navy's 250th anniversary over the weekend. \"So when you think of it that way, what we're doing is actually an act of kindness.\"",
      "In a notice to Congress obtained by CBS News, the Trump administration described the passengers on one alleged drug boat as \"unlawful combatants\" \u2014 the term that President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al Qaeda \u2014 and argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with the cartels.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday the attacks are \"targeted strikes against imminent threats against the United States,\" and the president does not need permission from Congress to carry them out.",
      "But critics \u2014 including some members of Congress \u2014 have argued Mr. Trump is acting without legal authority, and have pushed the administration to provide evidence that the boats were carrying drugs or that the passengers were guilty of anything. Congress has not authorized the use of military force against drug cartels.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Democrats forced a vote on a resolution that sought to block further strikes. The measure failed 48-51, but it picked up support from Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a longstanding skeptic of military force.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them?

      "In a notification to Congress after the second strike in mid-September, the Trump administration said the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations. The drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens, according to the White House.",

      "Regarding claims that the U.S. is acting in self-defense, David Janovsky, the acting director of The Constitution Project, said, \"The situation in the Caribbean is not that.\"",
      "Democrats' war powers resolution said the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations \"provides no legal authority for the president to use force against members of designated organizations or any foreign state.\"",
      "Kaine said the administration has not provided answers to lawmakers' questions on the intelligence supporting the strikes, the legal rationale for them or why the decision was made to attack the boats instead of intercept them.",
      "\"The White House does not maintain there's any congressional authorization,\" Kaine said. \"These military actions should stop unless authorized by Congress \u2014 not stopped, period, permanently, forever, can't-do-them stopped \u2014 unless authorized by congressional action.\"",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. If Congress does not authorize military force, the president has to withdraw forces within 90 days. The law was enacted in response to the Vietnam War as a check on the president's power to wage war without the consent of Congress.",
      "Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has been the loudest GOP critic of the strikes on the alleged drug smuggling boats. After the first strike, Paul condemned Vice President JD Vance, who said \"killing cartel members who poison our fellow citizens is the highest and best use of our military.\"",
      "\"What a despicable and thoughtless sentiment it is to glorify killing someone without a trial,\" Paul wrote.",
      "Paul underscored his point in a floor speech Wednesday, saying the strikes risk killing innocent people and the administration has presented no evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",

To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "Paul added, \"the blow-them-to-smithereens crowd also conveniently ignores the fact that death is generally not the penalty for drug smuggling.\"",
      "During debate on the resolution, other Republicans were untroubled about the president taking unilateral action against the alleged drug traffickers and that the administration has left Congress in the dark on details of the strikes.",
      "\"These strikes were fully compliant and fully justified,\" Republican Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho said.",
      "There were similar efforts by Congress over the summer to reassert its authority to declare war as tensions boiled over between Israel and Iran. The U.S. became directly involved in the 12-day war by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities before Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "After the Iran strikes, the Senate voted down a measure that Kaine had introduced in the days before the bombings to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran.",
      "\"The Iran situation was extremely time-limited,\" Janovsky said. \"The administration has made it very clear that they continue, and have in fact continued, to carry out these strikes in the Caribbean. So I think that certainly creates more ongoing urgency for Congress to act in some way in this case.\"",

      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Two regional sources told CBS News there is an agreement on all sides in principle on a hostage release, but procedural issues remain. Once those details are handled, it will be 48 hours before any release starts, sources said.",
      "Mr. Trump, in an interview Wednesday night with Fox News host Sean Hannity, said that hostages would \"probably\" be released on Monday, and the exchange would include the release of the bodies of deceased hostages still being held by Hamas.",
      "\"Hostages are going to be released. It's, probably, our time, would be probably Monday,\" Mr. Trump told Hannity. \"... And that'll include the bodies of the dead.\"",
      "A senior White House official previously told CBS News that the hostages could be released on Monday. The deal will go to Israel's cabinet for approval on Thursday, and if it votes yes, the Israeli military will need to withdraw to an agreed-upon line in the Gaza Strip, which should take under 24 hours. Then Hamas will have 72 hours to release the hostages, the official said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested to Hannity that other parts of the Israel-Hamas peace plan he laid out last week\u00a0\u2014 including a committee to oversee governance in Gaza \u2014 could be forthcoming.",
      "\"I think you're going to see people getting along, and you'll see Gaza being rebuilt,\" the president said. \"People are going to be taken care of. It's going to be a different world.\"",
      "Majed al-Ansari, an adviser to Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, also confirmed the deal on Wednesday, writing on X that an agreement was reached on \"the first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also released a short statement on the hostages that read, \"With God's help we will bring them all home.\"",
      "In a follow-up statement, Netanyahu said it was a \"big day for Israel\" and that he would \"convene the government to approve the agreement and bring all our dear hostages home.\" Netanyahu and Mr. Trump spoke Wednesday, which the Israeli government described as a \"very emotional and warm conversation.\"",
      "Hamas also confirmed in a statement it had reached an agreement.",
      "The terrorist group praised Qatari, Egyptian and Turkish mediators in helping broker a deal, and specifically thanked Mr. Trump for his \"efforts.\" It also called on the president to ensure that Israel \"fully complies with the terms of the agreement.\"",
      "In his earlier Truth Social post, Mr. Trump wrote: \"All Parties will be treated fairly!\"",
      "The announcement came just hours after Mr. Trump said he may travel to the Middle East this weekend, and was open to potentially traveling to the Gaza Strip.",
      "During an unrelated event at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump read a note that was passed to him by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The president said Rubio's note said negotiators were \"pretty close to a deal,\" and that they would \"need him\" pretty quickly.",
      "A little over a week ago, Mr. Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan at a White House meeting with Netanyahu, who expressed his full support for the proposal.",
      "The current round of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Oct. 6 in Egypt, with Egyptian and Qatari officials acting as intermediaries. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, had been expected to join the talks on Wednesday, days after Netanyahu confirmed he had sent a delegation \"to close the technical details of the release of our hostages.\"",
      "The war in Gaza, which has roiled the Middle East, was sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel. That attack killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "Israel's retaliatory war in Gaza against Hamas, which the U.S. and Israel consider a terrorist organization, has killed more than 67,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Of the 251 hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan had called for Hamas to release all 48 remaining hostages. Israel believes 20 of them are still alive. In return, Israel would release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, along with approximately 1,700 other Gazans detained since the start of the war.",
      "Hamas said on Oct. 4 it agreed to key portions of Mr. Trump's original proposal \u2014 including the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel and relinquishing its governance of Gaza.

      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were expected to arrive in Egypt on Wednesday to join the conversations, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Israeli officials believe 48 of those people remain captive, though only 20 are believed to still be alive.",
      "Since that day, the Gaza Strip's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says Israel's retaliatory war has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. Israel disputes that figure but provides no estimate of its own, and the United Nations considers the health ministry's count the most reliable information available, as Israel has barred foreign journalists from operating independently in Gaza.",
      "Ricardo Pires, a spokesman for the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, said this week that what he calls Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza has killed or maimed at least 61,000 children since the war started.",
      "UNICEF and the global charity Save the Children, which cited data compiled by the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office, say that on average, a child dies every hour in Gaza \u2014 or \"a classroom of children\" per day, as UNICEF put it.",
      "Since the war started, Save the Children says at least 20,000 kids have been killed in total \u2013 amounting to nearly a third of all Palestinians believed to have died in the war.",
      "UNICEF spokesman James Elder, told CBS News that when he visited one of Gaza's beleaguered hospitals this week, \"the first thing I saw was four children who had all been shot by quadcopters [military drones], then I went into a hallway and it was wall-to-wall children across all the corridors.\"",
      "\"There was a boy bleeding out on the floor who had apparently been there for five hours, then he was put on a stretcher only for another child to be put in his place,\" Elder told CBS News. \"Then I watched a little girl die. That's half an hour here in Gaza.\"",

It's not. It's violent. It's repetitious, and it also increases trauma.\"",
      "The U.N. estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population, some 1.9 million people, have been forcibly displaced during the war, many of them multiple times as the focus of Israel's military operations has shifted. Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces ordered everyone to leave Gaza City, the enclave's biggest population center, and to move further south, to areas such as Khan Younis.",
      "It's led to another mass exodus, which aid workers say has increased the suffering in the region and made it harder to help those showing up, often with nothing.",

      "El Paso Bishop Mark Seitz also showed Leo a video detailing the plight of migrants, and told The Associated Press afterward that Leo vowed to \"stand with\" them and the Catholic leaders who are trying to help them.",
      "\"He had a few words for us, thanking us for our commitment to the immigrant peoples and also saying that he hopes that the bishops' conference will speak to this issue,\" said Seitz, chair of the migration committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
      "Leo, who was born in Chicago and is also a citizen of Peru, hasn't spoken much about U.S. politics since being named the leader of the Catholic Church, but recently pointed out what he sees as contradictions in debates around abortion, the death penalty and immigration.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" he said earlier this month. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Catholic leaders in the U.S. have denounced the Trump administration's crackdown, which has split up families, incited fears and upended life in American churches and schools that serve migrant communities. The administration has defended the crackdown as safeguarding public safety and national security.",
      "\"We don't want to get into the political fray, we're not politicians, but we need to teach the faith,\" and especially the Gospel message recognizing the inherent dignity of all God's children, and to care for the poor and welcome the stranger, Seitz said.",
      "\"They're terrorized. And it is a fear that has a long-term impact on people, on their lives,\" he said.",
      "The letters and video Seitz brought to Leo detail the fear that even legal migrants are facing every day. U.S. citizens, immigrants with legal status and children have been among those detained in increasingly brazen and aggressive encounters by federal agents. In Leo's hometown of Chicago, immigration agents have stormed apartment complexes by helicopter as families slept, deployed chemical agents near a public school and put handcuffs on a city official at a hospital.",
      "\"They can't go out. They are afraid to shop, to go to church and so they stay home,\" wrote Maria in one of the letters delivered to Leo. Originally from Guatemala, she has lived in San Francisco for a quarter-century and qualified for asylum years ago, but has relatives in the U.S. who are not legal.",
      "\"The pope needs to talk to Trump and ask Trump to think about what he's doing to immigrants,\" she wrote. \"The pope needs to plead with Trump and Trump needs to listen to him. Trump has to change what he's doing.\"",
      "Just before he died, Pope Francis strongly rebuked the Trump administration's plans for mass deportations, warning that the forceful removal of people purely because of their illegal status deprives them of their inherent dignity.",
      "History's first U.S. pope has followed in Francis' line. Last weekend, Leo celebrated a special Holy Year Mass for migrants, denouncing the \"coldness of indifference\" and the \"stigma of discrimination\" that migrants desperate to flee violence and suffering often face. Asked by reporters this week about the crackdown in Chicago, Leo declined to comment.",
      "Prior to becoming pope, Leo, or then-Cardinal Robert Prevost, often shared posts on social media that were critical of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "On Wednesday, Leo was running late for the audience with Seitz and the delegation of around a dozen people, including members of the Hope Border Institute, an advocacy group formed in partnership with the El Paso diocese. The delegation members assured Leo that they would stand with him as they chatted in a Vatican reception room.",
      "\"Later on in the meeting he said, 'I will stand with you,' so it was a beautiful little exchange,\" said Seitz.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Energy think tank Ember says a slight drop in global fossil fuel power marks \"a turning point,\" as the U.S. and Europe lag behind by China and India in investment.",
    "story": [
      "Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.",
      "Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released Tuesday. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.",
      "\"A turning point\" for global fossil fuel power generation",
      "The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power \u2014 even as demand for electricity skyrockets \u2014 with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.",
      "\"That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,\" said Ma\u0142gorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.",
      "At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.",
      "\"The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,\" said Wiatros-Motyka. \"This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.\"",
      "The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.",
      "Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.",
      "China and India leading the green energy transition",
      "Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.",
      "In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.",
      "India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.",
      "In both nations, emissions fell.",
      "\"It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,\" said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. \"This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.\"",
      "U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase",
      "In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.",
      "The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.",
      "Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.",
      "Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.",
      "In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.",
      "Experts warn that Mr. Trump's efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.",
      "\"The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they're also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That's going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,\" Gerrard said.",
      "Renewables \"still have an opportunity to make inroads into displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,\" said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn't involved in the report.",
      "Smith said that while she remained \"very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.\"",

      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",

      "The international award honors people or organizations whose work makes the world a more peaceful place. Nominees aren't made public by the Nobel Committee, but some individuals publicly share who they nominate. World leaders, humanitarians and international organizations have received the peace prize since it was first given out in the early 20th century.",
      "Here's what to know about the Nobel Peace Prize and if Mr. Trump could receive it:",
      "When is the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "The 2025 winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday, Oct. 10 at 5 a.m. ET. It will be awarded on Dec. 10 at a formal ceremony in Oslo, Norway.",
      "What is the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Prize was established by a Swedish businessman named Alfred Nobel. In his will, he said that his fortune was to be used to establish a fund that could distribute prizes \"to those who ... shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind,\" according to the Nobel Peace Prize's website.",
      "Nobel's will specified that it be given \"to the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between the nations and the abolition or reduction of standing armies and the formation and spreading of peace congresses,\" but many different kinds of work have been honored, including efforts to combat climate change and promote democracy.",
      "The award has been given to politicians who sought international peace, people who have worked for arms control and nuclear disarmament, and international human rights agencies. Other Nobel prizes are awarded for achievements in medicine, literature and other fields.",
      "Winners receive a medal, diploma and monetary prize, according to the award's website. The 6.6-centimeter gold medal shows a portrait of Nobel, with his name, birth year and year of death engraved on the edge. The back of the medal shows three men embracing, to symbolize international fraternity, and is engraved with the phrase \"For peace and fraternity among peoples\" in Latin.",
      "How is the Nobel Peace Prize awarded?",
      "According to the prize's website, the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to the person who has done the most to advance peace in the world. It is awarded by a committee selected by Norway's parliament. The other Nobel prizes are awarded in Sweden.",
      "Any person or organization can be nominated by any eligible nominators, according to the prize's website. Eligible nominators include members of national assemblies, members of governments, members of bodies like the International Court of Justice, college professors or directors and former prizewinners or members of the Nobel Committee. The nomination deadline is Jan. 31. Over 330 candidates were submitted for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The nominations aren't vetted before the nomination deadline, according to the prize's website, so nominations are not endorsements from the committee. The committee does not publicly comment on nominees. The names of nominees and nominating committee can't be announced for 50 years.",
      "Once the deadline passes, the Nobel Committee looks at the nominees and creates a shortlist of \"the most interesting and worthy candidates.\" Those shortlisted nominees then undergo \"assessments and examinations\" from committee members, according to the prize's website.",
      "The committee then decides on the winner or winners of the Nobel Peace Prize at its last meeting before the prize winners are announced in early October. The decision is made by majority vote, according to the prize website, but the committee attempts to make a unanimous decision on the winner.",
      "Who has won the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded 105 times since 1901, according to the prize's website. One hundred and thirty-nine laureates have been awarded, including 92 men, 19 women and 28 organizations.",
      "The prize's first recipients were French scientist and politician Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Passy and Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss businessman and co-founder of the Red Cross. Passy was honored for his \"lifelong work for international peace conferences, diplomacy and arbitration,\" while Durant received the award for his \"humanitarian efforts to help wounded soldiers and create international understanding,\" according to the prize's website.",
      "Other notable prizewinners have included Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai in 2014 and former President Barack Obama in 2009. Obama's win, for \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,\" was considered a surprise, as he had been in office for less than a year.",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter received the honor in 2002. Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, and Bishop\u00a0Desmond Tutu, who worked to end apartheid in South Africa, received it in 1984.",
      "Organizations that have received the Nobel Peace Prize include the United Nations' World Food Program and the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons.",
      "Could Donald Trump get the Nobel Peace Prize?",
      "Mr. Trump has touted himself as the \"president of peace\" and has said he\u00a0ended six or seven wars during his second term, including conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan and Thailand and Cambodia. Not all of the conflicts have been fully settled, and it's not clear if the United States' actions or influence were decisive in all of them, foreign policy experts previously told CBS News. Mr. Trump has also proposed a peace plan for Israel and Gaza, and spoken with world leaders about ending Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in\u00a0June that the Nobel Committee \"should give\" him the Nobel Peace Prize, and that he \"should have gotten it four or five times.\" In September, Mr. Trump told United Nations delegates that \"everyone says\" he should get the award. He made similar comments when military generals gathered in Virginia last week. Still, he told CBS News in September 2025 that he is not seeking the prize.",
      "\"I have nothing to say about it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"All I can do is put out wars.\" He added, \"I don't seek attention. I just want to save lives.\"",
      "Mr. Trump was nominated for the prize by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July and by the government of Pakistan in June. This week, the Israeli Hostages Families Forum called on the Nobel Prize committee to give the peace prize to Mr. Trump for his \"unwavering commitment and extraordinary leadership\" in seeking a deal to bring home the remaining hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. But these efforts have come past the deadline for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize. Mr. Trump was also\u00a0nominated for the prize\u00a0during his first term.",
      "Experts told The Associated Press the Nobel Committee is unlikely to award Mr. Trump the prize for his second-term achievements so far. However, Obama was awarded the prize without having secured any peace agreements in his first year in the White House.",
      "The committee tends to focus on \"the durability of peace, the promotion of international fraternity and the quiet work of institutions that strengthen those goals,\" the AP reported. The committee also likely does not want to be seen as caving to political pressure, one expert told the AP.",

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the fourth strike on Friday, saying \"four male narco-terrorists\" were killed, but offering no other details on who they were.",
      "Mr. Trump declared in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News that the U.S. was in an \"armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the Caribbean, alleging they are trying to bring \"deadly poison\" to U.S. shores.",

      "Mr. Trump gave fishermen a reason to worry after the first U.S. military strike on Sept. 2, which he said killed 11 suspected narco-terrorists.",
      "\"Boat traffic is substantially down,\" Mr. Trump said in early September. \"I don't even know about fishermen. They may say, 'I'm not getting on the boat.'\"",

      "The drug is a peptide, which is a small protein that works like a roadblock remover. After a spinal cord injury, the body sends out signals that tell nerve fibers to stop growing. This drug blocks those signals, so the nerves have a better chance to regrow.",
      "\"This peptide can block those inhibitory signals,\" Ryan said. \"There is a little bit of evidence in animals that it can actually enhance the growth of neurons.\"",

      "Researchers observed \"electrophysiological changes\" in the group that received the experimental medication. (iStock)",
      "Perez said more research is necessary to determine how long the effects of this drug will last.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announces the National Guard will be deployed to Chicago and touts the success of his Washington, D.C., crime crackdown.",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has spent weeks criticizing President\u00a0Donald Trump's threats to deploy National Guard troops to the city \u2014 a stance that some Republicans call a sharp reversal from the Democratic Party\u2019s long-held opposition to \"states\u2019 rights\" arguments.",
      "While the legality of Trump\u2019s actions remains to be seen \u2014 his federalization efforts are being reviewed by several federal and appeals courts this week \u2014 the move has sparked a fierce debate across party lines. Democrats, for their part, have denounced the move as unlawful and beyond the scope of Trump\u2019s authority.",
      "\"The president has declared war on poor people,\" Johnson said during a press conference, responding to Trump\u2019s plan to send National Guard troops to Chicago. His comments followed a series of warnings from Democratic governors and mayors who argue that federalizing Guard units is both unnecessary and an unlawful intrusion into local authority.",
      "Republican lawmakers and conservative commentators argue that Democrats are contradicting their past stance on state sovereignty. \"Democrats were out of touch with reality the moment they said they don\u2019t need President Trump\u2019s help; everything is fine in Chicago,\" Gianno Caldwell, a Chicago native and founder of the Caldwell Institute of Public Safety, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker speak during a news conference in Chicago on Aug. 25, 2025.\u00a0 (AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"When you look at the numbers, you look at the crime, 75% of the murders that are committed in Chicago are going unsolved. Seventy-five percent \u2014 that is a serious issue, a systemic issue that Chicagoans are dealing with on a daily basis,\" Caldwell said.",
      "Caldwell also pointed to a 2012 clash over the Obama administration\u2019s Secure Communities program, which required local police to share fingerprint data with federal immigration agents. Republicans at the time accused Obama of hypocrisy for suing Arizona over strict immigration enforcement while taking no action against Democratic-led Chicago and Cook County, which sought to limit cooperation with federal authorities.",
      "But others disagree, especially on claims of hypocrisy. \"However you want to characterize it,\" the accusations of hypocrisy \"are a symptom of the poverty of our current political debate,\" George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County told Fox News Digital in an interview.",
      "\"A lot of liberal Democrats, not conservative Democrats, in the 1960s, 1950s, and before that, were critics of states' rights because segregationists were using the principle of federalism or states' rights as a sort of \u2018watchword\u2019 to protect segregation,\" Musgrove said.",
      "\"Today, the president is walking away from the idea of states' rights because he wants to punish Democratic cities,\" Musgrove said.",
      "Trump, for his part, has characterized the actions as necessary to crack down on violent crime and to help carry out his administration\u2019s policy priorities, including immigration enforcement.",
      "But Democratic mayors, including Johnson, have rejected the notion that their cities are in the throes of violence necessary to warrant a military response. Johnson has emphasized the progress Chicago has made in reducing violent crime. (Homicides in Chicago have fallen 28% so far in 2025 compared to the same point last year, according to data from the city's police department, and down by roughly 50% compared to 2020, when violent crime in many major U.S. cities peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic.)",
      "Ultimately, Musgrove told Fox News Digital, the question of \"hypocrisy\" is too simplistic and fails to capture the broader context, principles and policies at stake in a given political moment.",

      "\"And it sort of shifts to this issue of hypocrisy, rather than dealing first with the fact [of whether] this is a legal question that can be decided in a court of law, based on legal principles.\"",

      "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on the CDC's decision to update COVID vaccine guidance and more on 'Special Report.'",
      "A county in California wine country is beefing up its vaccine recommendations and instituting a mask mandate, citing \"greater risk\" of contracting COVID-19 amid the start of the annual flu season.",
      "The Sonoma County Department of Public Health's Interim Health Officer Dr. Karen Smith issued an order Monday requiring anyone entering certain healthcare facilities in the county to wear a mask. Facilities subject to the order include skilled nursing facilities, portions of long-term care facilities where nursing care is provided, acute and non-acute rehabilitation facilities, infusion centers, and dialysis centers, according to the order.",
      "\"The rationale behind this order is to protect the most vulnerable populations (such as the elderly and cancer patients) and to try to prevent medical staff from getting sick and creating staffing problems for facilities,\" a spokesperson for the Sonoma County Department of Health told Fox News Digital.",

      "The mask mandate will run from Nov. 1 until March 31, 2026, and the order states that Smith can expand the type of facilities subject to it on an as-needed basis. Additionally, the requirement will be put in place annually unless otherwise rescinded.",
      "The order does provide some exemptions, including anyone \"with a diagnosed medical condition, mental health condition, or disability that prevents the individual from wearing a face mask.\" Hearing impaired folks who must see the mouth to communicate are also exempt, as well as anyone else for whom local, state or federal regulators deem could be harmed from wearing one.",

      "The order also dictates what masks must be worn. A surgical mask, KN95, KF94, or N95 respirator are acceptable, but more informal masks, such as a scarf, ski mask, balaclava, bandana, turtleneck, collar, cloth mask, or \"any mask that has an unfiltered, one-way exhaust valve,\" will not satisfy the order's requirements.",
      "BIDEN ADMIN PUT SOME AMERICANS WHO RESISTED MASK MANDATES OR WERE INVOLVED IN JAN 6 ON SEVERE NO-FLY LIST: TSA",
      "Coinciding with the mask mandate in Sonoma County, Smith also issued stronger guidance pertaining to COVID-19 and flu vaccines, telling the public it is strongly recommended for everyone 6-months of age and older. She also recommended that both vaccinated and unvaccinated people wear masks in indoor public spaces when the COVID influenza risk is high.",
      "Smith's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, and even her mask mandate aimed at protecting older populations, contradict guidance coming from Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).",

      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",

      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",

The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them.

Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details.

Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

    "story": [
      "Paradromics is shifting from research to clinical trials.",
      "When someone stops breathing, the clock starts ticking. First responders often need to get air into the lungs fast, and one of the most reliable ways is to slide a tube into the windpipe. This process, called intubation, keeps the airway open so that oxygen can flow again.",
      "Here's the catch: intubation is incredibly hard. Even trained doctors can struggle, and every extra second puts the patient at greater risk. Now, researchers at UC Santa Barbara have designed a soft robotic device that could change how first responders handle these emergencies. It helps guide the breathing tube into place quickly, safely, and with far less training than traditional methods.",

      "Why breathing tubes are so tough to place",
      "Our bodies are built to keep food and foreign objects out of the lungs. A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "Even trained doctors can struggle with intubation. (Universal Images Group/Getty Images)",
      "How the soft robot works",
      "The new system, called the soft robotic intubation system (SRIS), takes a gentler approach. First, a curved guide sits at the back of the throat. Then a soft inflatable tube slowly unrolls from the inside out as it advances. Instead of being forced in, it naturally follows the right path into the windpipe. This reduces friction, lowers the risk of injury and adapts to different body shapes automatically.\u00a0\"This growing paradigm naturally accounts for minor variations in anatomy,\" said lead author David Haggerty, a recent UCSB Ph.D. graduate.",

      "The results are eye-opening:",
      "Experts had a 100% success rate.Paramedics and EMTs reached a 96% success rate with just five minutes of training.Non-experts placed the tube in an average of 21 seconds, less than half the time needed with advanced video laryngoscopes.",

      "Cyberguy lays out ways to avoid inheritance scams. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "The \"advanced fee\" gift: Anyone who promises to expedite probate proceedings or secure larger inheritances for an upfront fee is probably in it to win it (for themselves). Some cases even involve disgruntled family members acting out of greed. These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money. If someone claims you have an inheritance coming, but they need \"a fee to unlock it\" or they promise to \"handle your probate case\" for a small upfront fee, you guessed it \u2014 nothing ever comes from it.",
      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines.

      "Never send money or give information to an unsolicited contact about an estate. If someone claims you owe fees or have obligations, independently verify their identity or company. Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",
      "In most jurisdictions, you can't prevent a probate filing from going public. But you can minimize additional data exposure by not sharing anything on social media and limiting contact to only key parties that you trust with financial information.",

The announcement comes at a time when large-scale attacks on cloud CRM systems have already shaken tech and retail sectors alike, with Salesforce clients such as Google, Allianz and Dior reporting similar intrusions.

Today, it ranks among the world's largest automakers by revenue and is fifth in volume globally. The company houses 14 well-known brands, including Jeep and Dodge, as well as Peugeot, Maserati and Vauxhall, and operates manufacturing infrastructure across more than 130 countries. That global scale naturally makes it a tempting target for cyber adversaries.",
      "Stellantis confirmed hackers stole customer contact details in a recent breach. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "In its public statement, Stellantis clarified that only contact information was taken. Since the compromised third-party platform does not host financial or deeply sensitive personal data, Stellantis asserts that Social Security numbers, payment details and health records were out of reach of the attackers. In response, the company activated its incident response protocols, launched a full investigation, contained the breach, notified authorities and began alerting affected customers. It also issued warnings about phishing and urged customers not to click suspicious links.",

These attacks form part of a broader campaign aimed at Salesforce customers.

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

A password manager can create strong, unique passwords for every account. That way, one breach will not put your other accounts at risk.

      "Attackers often combine exposed contact information with other data to build complete identity profiles. Identity theft protection services monitor for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized credit applications or changes to official records, and alert you early so you can act before serious damage occurs. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "WHY IPHONE USERS ARE THE NEW PRIME SCAM TARGETS",
      "Mac malware often hides in the background, making it hard to spot at first. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Signs your Mac might be infected",
      "Spotting malware on macOS is not always straightforward. Many threats are designed to stay hidden, running quietly in the background while collecting data or opening a backdoor for attackers. Still, there are a few red flags that usually signal something is wrong.",
      "One of the first signs is slower performance or frequent overheating. If your Mac suddenly takes a long time to boot, runs hot during light tasks or lags when performing simple actions, it might be doing more behind the scenes than you realize. Apps that crash or freeze more often than usual are another warning sign. Occasional app failures are normal, but if built-in tools like Safari, Notes or Mail begin acting unstable, it may point to malicious interference.",
      "It is also worth paying attention to what is happening under the hood. Checking Activity Monitor for unknown processes or unusually high CPU or memory usage can reveal malware that tries to hide itself with random or unfamiliar names. Redirected web traffic is another classic symptom. If your browser takes you to strange websites, shows pop-ups, or installs new extensions you never approved, adware or spyware might already be present.",
      "Finally, unexplained changes to your security settings should always raise suspicion. If you notice your firewall turned off, privacy permissions modified, or login items appearing without your knowledge, something could have gained unauthorized control of your system.",

      "Strange app behavior, pop-ups or overheating may signal something\u2019s wrong. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How macOS protects you by default",
      "Apple has built several layers of defense into macOS, many of which run silently in the background to keep your system secure. Knowing how they work can help you understand what protections are already in place and where you might still need to add more safeguards.",
      "Gatekeeper is one of the most important built-in security tools. It checks every app before it runs to make sure it comes from a verified developer, warning or blocking you if the app is not trusted. Another layer of defense is XProtect, Apple's built-in malware scanner. It updates automatically and can stop many known threats from running, although it is not as thorough as specialized antivirus software.",
      "System Integrity Protection, or SIP, is another important safeguard. It locks down critical system files and processes so that malware cannot tamper with them even if it gains access. macOS also uses sandboxing and strict permission controls to contain threats. Apps run in isolated environments and must explicitly request permission to access sensitive data such as your camera, files, or location.",
      "Together, these features make it significantly harder for malicious software to infect your Mac or cause serious damage. However, they are not perfect. Attackers are constantly developing new techniques to bypass these protections, and many threats rely on human error rather than technical exploits. That is why taking additional precautions is still essential, even on a Mac.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Even Apple\u2019s built-in protections can miss new or advanced threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do if your Mac is already infected",
      "If you find yourself dealing with a Mac that's already compromised, these steps can help you get back in control:",
      "Unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This prevents malware from sending more data out or pulling in additional malicious code.",
      "Use an external drive or cloud service you trust. Avoid copying entire system folders \u2013 just grab personal documents, photos and files you can't replace. You don't want to back up the malware along with them.",
      "Restart your Mac and hold the Shift key. Safe Mode prevents some malware from launching and makes it easier to run cleanup tools.",

      "If malware persists, wiping your system may be the only option. Erase your Mac's drive and reinstall macOS from scratch. Restore only the clean files you backed up earlier.",
      "If your iPhone, iPad or other personal devices are showing strange behavior, run security scans, update their software and reset key passwords. Malware can sometimes spread through shared Wi-Fi networks, cloud accounts or files.",
      "Even after cleanup, assume some of your data may have been exposed. Update your Apple ID, email, banking and work accounts with strong, unique passwords. Turn on\u00a02FA\u00a0wherever possible.",

      "Some cyber threats do not reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they have stolen. These steps can help you strengthen your defenses and reduce the chances of future infections.",
      "macOS's built-in protections are useful but basic. A strong antivirus adds an extra layer by detecting threats in real time, blocking malicious downloads and even identifying new types of malware before they spread. A strong antivirus also scans email attachments and browser activity, areas where many Mac users are most vulnerable.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt the CyberGuy reports on how Instagram safety tools are not 'foolproof' for kids, shares tips for how to protect teens online and more on 'Fox & Friends.'",
      "Meta is rolling out new protections aimed at making social media safer for young people. In September 2024, Instagram introduced Teen Accounts, which come with built-in safeguards that limit who can contact teens, what content they see and how long they spend on the app.",
      "Since then, adoption has been strong: 97% of teens ages 13-15 kept the default settings, and 94% of parents say Teen Accounts are helpful. Now, Meta is expanding those protections beyond Instagram. Teen Accounts are coming to Facebook and Messenger worldwide, bringing stronger safety standards to more of the apps teens use every day.",

      "Critics and researchers question Meta's teen safety tools",
      "However, not everyone agrees that these protections go far enough.\u00a0Research regarding the effectiveness of Instagram's teen safety features, as reported by child-safety advocacy groups and corroborated by researchers at Northeastern University (Sept. 25, 2025), paints a different picture. The study found that only eight of 47 safety features tested were fully effective, and internal documents suggest that Meta was aware of some shortcomings. Critics also argued that certain protections, like manual comment-hiding, place the burden on teens themselves rather than preventing harm upfront. They questioned whether time management tools were robust enough, giving some features middling grades despite functioning as described.",
      "\"Misleading and dangerously speculative reports such as this one undermine the important conversation about teen safety,\" Meta told CyberGuy, \"This report repeatedly misrepresents our efforts to empower parents and protect teens, misstating how our safety tools work and how millions of parents and teens are using them today.",
      "\"Teen Accounts lead the industry because they provide automatic safety protections and straightforward parental controls. The reality is teens who were placed into these protections saw less sensitive content, experienced less unwanted contact and spent less time on Instagram at night.

For educators, the School Partnership Program provides a direct connection to Meta, ensuring reports of unsafe behavior get attention quickly. Students benefit too, with a curriculum designed to give them practical tools for navigating online life safely.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Meta's expansion of Teen Accounts marks a major shift in how social platforms approach safety. By adding built-in protections, the company reduces risks for teens without requiring parents to manage every setting. At the same time, the School Partnership Program gives educators new tools to protect students in real time. The online safety curriculum goes one step further by teaching kids how to recognize threats and respond confidently. Still, advocacy groups and independent researchers question whether these efforts are enough, and Meta's strong defense shows just how high the stakes are in the teen safety debate. As teens spend more of their lives online, the responsibility to protect them grows. The real test will be how well these tools hold up against evolving online threats.",

      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",

      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",

      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",

Catherine, a longtime HP desktop user, shared her concerns with us: \"I need to purchase a new/updated computer with Windows 11 pretty darn quick. I've utilized HP desktops for years and would prefer to continue to do so. My concern deals with transferring everything from one computer to another, made more interesting since my husband and I have separate setups and log-ins. I had a My Passport running, but now I believe a lot is in the cloud. We are concerned about losing our emails/contacts, etc. I also use various programs for a couple of groups I'm involved with (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Adobe Acrobat, etc.), which I cannot afford to lose.

      "As\u00a0President Donald Trump moves to finalize his 20-point plan to end the Gaza war, Israel faces a pivotal decision that could reshape the conflict\u2019s aftermath. The framework envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the return of all hostages, and a major prisoner exchange. In return, Hamas would commit to disarmament and allow a technocratic transitional authority to manage Gaza\u2019s reconstruction.",
      "Part of the agreement involves releasing hundreds of convicted Palestinian terrorists, a clause that has already triggered backlash from the families of victims.",
      "Dr. Michael Milshtein, head of the Moshe Dayan Forum at Tel Aviv University and one of Israel\u2019s foremost experts on Hamas, told Fox News Digital that the list of roughly 250 prisoners contains names that represent what he called \"a real strategic danger.\"",

      "Palestinian Hamas terrorists stand guard on the day of the handover of hostages held in Gaza since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack, as part of a ceasefire and a hostages-prisoners swap deal between Hamas and Israel, in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, Feb. 22, 2025.\u00a0 (Reuters/Hatem Khaled/File Photo)",
      "\"These are not low-level activists,\" Milshtein said. \"Among them are people who built power and influence inside prison. When released, they will return as leaders.\"",
      "He cited several examples that, he said, demonstrate the risk of past exchanges. Among the prisoners now under discussion are Abbas al-Sayed, convicted for the 2002 Park Hotel bombing in Netanya that killed 30 people; Ibrahim Hamed, former Hamas military commander in the West Bank, serving more than 40 life sentences; Abdullah Barghouti, who produced explosives for a series of large-scale suicide bombings and Hassan Salameh, convicted for orchestrating multiple bus attacks in the 1990s.",
      "Ibrahim Hamed, a former head of the Hamas terrorist movement in the West Bank, looks on as he arrives for sentencing at the Ofer military court near Ramallah, West Bank, on July 1, 2012. The Israeli military court sentenced Hamed to 54 life terms after convicting him of ordering attacks that killed dozens of Israelis, the army said.",
      "\"These are people with dozens of life sentences,\" Milshtein explained. \"We\u2019ve already seen what happens when such figures are freed. Many of those who carried out the Oct. 7 massacre were prisoners released in the 2011 Gilad Shalit deal.\"",

He pointed to Abdel Nasser Issa, a Hamas operative convicted in 1995 who was released earlier this year and soon relocated to Turkey, where he began appearing in podcasts as part of the group\u2019s senior political echelon. \"That is the model,\" Milshtein said. \"They enter prison as operatives and emerge as decision-makers.\"",
      "Among the most concerning names, he added, is Jamal Al-Hur, who he described as \"one of the five most dangerous.\" Al-Hur, deeply connected to Hamas\u2019s hierarchy, has served nearly three decades in prison and now acts as a key liaison between jailed operatives and the group\u2019s external leadership. \"He didn\u2019t enter as a leader but became one inside,\" Milshtein said. \"If released, he will re-establish himself quickly\u2014just as others did before him.\"",

Twice before, his name appeared on proposed release lists and was removed after public pressure.",

      "Sharon Edri is seen here with his sister, Danielle Edri Karten. Edri Karten opposes the release of her brother's killer.",
      "\"He kidnapped, mutilated, tortured my uncle,\" said Izzy Karten, Edri\u2019s nephew, in an interview with\u00a0Fox News Digital from New York. \"He went to jail, was released, and went on to commit the Apropo Caf\u00e9 bombing.

      "Yadlin explained that intelligence is gathered by the Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s domestic security agency akin to the FBI; Aman, Israel\u2019s Military Intelligence Directorate, which is the country\u2019s largest intelligence agency; and the Mossad, when the target is located abroad.

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/world/israel/ceasefire-israel-hamas-gaza-palestinians-trump-netanyahu-qatar-rcna217806",
    "published": "Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:15:48 GMT",
    "summary": "The previous ceasefire lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18, when Israel resumed military operations in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's announcement that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "The plan, which was mediated by Qatar, Turkey and Egypt, will also need formal agreement at 5 p.m. local time Thursday (10 a.m. ET) by Israel's government, an Israel official briefed on the matter told NBC News. That does not appear a sure thing, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowing to vote against it.",
      "A spokesperson for the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that a ceasefire would then take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium- and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Robert Roberson, the condemned man on Texas\u2019 death row who faces execution next week, say the first episode of a \u201cDateline\u201d podcast about his case includes \u201chighly relevant\u201d evidence that highlights judicial misconduct and supports their petition for a new trial.",
      "The ongoing claim before the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals seeks to halt Roberson\u2019s Oct. 16 execution for the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki. If he is executed by lethal injection, Roberson, 58, would be the first person put to death in the United States in a case of \u201cshaken baby syndrome.\u201d",
      "For more on this case, listen to episodes of the \u201cDateline\u201d podcast \u201cThe Last Appeal\u201d",
      "In a filing Monday, Roberson\u2019s lawyers wrote that an interview with Nikki\u2019s maternal grandfather conducted by \u201cDateline\u201d anchor Lester Holt is \u201cdirectly relevant to the judicial misconduct claim,\u201d which alleges a \u201cserious violation of Mr. Roberson\u2019s fundamental right to a trial before an impartial tribunal \u2014 and before a tribunal that appears impartial.\u201d",
      "Gretchen Sween, a lawyer for Roberson, said in a statement, \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that we are discovering the truth about this glaring, undisclosed evidence of bias only by chance, from a podcast, days before Robert is scheduled to be executed for a tragedy that has been mislabeled as a crime.\u201d",
      "In January 2002, Roberson and Nikki fell asleep in their East Texas home and he later awoke, he said, after he heard a sound and found Nikki had fallen out of bed, according to court documents.",
      "Later that morning, when Roberson discovered his daughter was unconscious and her lips were blue, he rushed her to an emergency room.",
      "Within three days, a detective arrested Roberson on a capital murder charge.",
      "For the initial episode of \u201cThe Last Appeal\u201d podcast, which was released Monday, Holt interviewed Larry Bowman, Nikki\u2019s maternal grandfather.",
      "Bowman identified Anderson County Judge Bascom Bentley as the judiciary official who called the hospital, directing it to contact the Bowmans for permission to authorize removing Nikki from life support.",
      "\u201cMatter of fact, Judge Bentley told \u2019em we were the parents,\u201d Bowman said.",
      "But Roberson\u2019s lawyers say that the Bowmans did not have that authority and that Roberson had custody of Nikki and was appointed her sole conservator in November 2001, about two months before she died.",
      "Roberson had been a single father caring for Nikki after her mother lost custody because of personal issues.",
      "In addition to Bentley\u2019s providing false information to the hospital, which allowed Nikki to be removed from life-sustaining care, according to the latest filing, he was the judge who signed Roberson\u2019s arrest warrant based on the \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d diagnosis and then presided over all but one proceeding in Roberson\u2019s criminal trial.",
      "Roberson\u2019s lawyers say Bentley\u2019s involvement in the early stages of Roberson\u2019s case is material to their larger claims of judicial misconduct that they say tainted his trial.",
      "\u201cAny objective member of the public, with knowledge of the new facts, would reasonably believe that Judge Bentley had prejudged Mr. Roberson\u2019s guilt and, animated by that presumption of guilt, improperly circumvented the law governing parental rights and the guarantees of due process and thus should have recused himself from presiding over Mr. Roberson\u2019s criminal case to preserve the appearance of impartiality,\u201d the court filing says. \u201cJudge Bentley\u2019s failure to do so caused structural error and requires a new trial.\u201d",
      "Bentley died in 2017. The Texas Attorney General\u2019s Office, which is now overseeing the prosecution against Roberson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declined to be interviewed for the \u201cDateline\u201d podcast.",
      "Roberson was nearly put to death a year ago, but a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers used their legislative power to help block his execution in a last-minute maneuver.",
      "State Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has previously said Roberson murdered his daughter by \u201cbeating her so brutally that she ultimately died,\u201d vowed to press ahead with an execution date.",
      "In filings this year, Roberson\u2019s legal team has argued that there is new evidence of his innocence and that the medical and scientific methods used to convict him of so-called shaken baby syndrome, in which a child is shaken so violently that the action causes head trauma, have since been largely discredited.",
      "His team also claims that judicial officials in Anderson County, where a jury sentenced him to death in 2003, violated Roberson\u2019s constitutional rights.",
      "Aside from the request in front of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Roberson filed a separate plea this month with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay of execution so he could file a new legal challenge claiming his imprisonment is illegal because of \u201coverwhelming evidence that he was convicted using discredited \u2018science.\u2019\u201d That appeal is also ongoing.",
      "Previous attempts to stop Roberson\u2019s execution have been unsuccessful, including as it relates to a 2013 \u201cjunk science\u201d law in Texas that allows prisoners to potentially challenge convictions based on advances in forensic science.",
      "While doctors and law enforcement officials concluded that Nikki suffered blunt-force trauma and was shaken, Roberson\u2019s defense team says a new understanding of \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d shows that other medical conditions can be factors in a child\u2019s death, as it believes was the case with Nikki."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to deploy National Guard troops in states that don\u2019t want them are being tested Thursday in two different courts.",
      "Lawyers for Chicago and Illinois are before a federal judge to try to block troops from being deployed in the country's third most populous city, while attorneys for Portland and Oregon are urging a federal appeals court to leave in place a restraining order against troop deployments there.",
      "The hearings \u2014 in Chicago and San Francisco \u2014 began around noon ET in courthouses about 2,000 miles apart.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for the courts to do the right thing,\u201d Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Trump defended his actions in both states. \"Everything we\u2019re doing is very lawful. What they\u2019re doing is not lawful,\" he said at the White House later Wednesday.",
      "Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the president \u201cwill not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by the Court.\u201d",
      "Illinois on Monday sued seeking to block the administration from deploying federalized National Guard troops on the streets of Chicago, contending it's illegal, unconstitutional and unnecessary.",
      "Trump ordered the deployment over the weekend. U.S. Northern Command said that 500 National Guard members have been mobilized \u2014 300 from Illinois and 200 from Texas \u2014 and that some of the troops from Texas were on duty \"in the greater Chicago area\" as of Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cThese forces will protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other U.S. Government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property,\u201d Northern Command said in a statement.",
      "Members of the Texas National Guard were spotted Thursday morning at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, NBC Chicago reported. The village told the station that 45 members of the Texas guard had arrived overnight.",
      "The site is one of two that the military said in a court filing that it plans on sending troops to in the coming days. The other site is a federal courthouse in Chicago on Friday \"due to two high profile cases involving DHS activities and personnel.\"",
      "The state's lawsuit argues that there's no need for troops in Chicago and that the administration has been trying to provoke unrest by increasing the presence of federal law agents who are using \"unprecedented, brute force tactics for civil immigration enforcement.\"",
      "Those tactics include shooting \"chemical munitions at groups that included media and legal observers\" at an ICE facility outside Chicago and staging a dramatically produced raid at an apartment building in which agents rappelled down from Black Hawk helicopters.",
      "\u201cThe community\u2019s horror at these tactics and their significant consequences have resulted in entirely foreseeable protests,\u201d the suit said.",
      "\u201cThe deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois\u2019s sovereignty and right to self-governance\" and \"will cause only more unrest,\" it added.",
      "At a hearing in a different case in federal court in Chicago Thursday, a judge was expected to sign a temporary restraining order in favor of a group of journalists, protesters and religious practitioners who filed suit earlier this week over federal agents\u2019 \u201cexcessive\u201d use of force and threats against what plaintiffs\u2019 actions described as reporting, \u201cpeaceful\u201d protest, and prayer.",
      "The White House has maintained that Trump is trying to keep American cities and federal personnel safe. Trump said this week that if the courts wind up derailing his efforts to use the National Guard, he could invoke the Insurrection Act, which would empower him to use the U.S. military domestically.",
      "\"The Trump administration is committed to restoring law and order in American cities that are plagued by violence due to Democrat mismanagement. And President Trump will not stand by while violent rioters attack federal law enforcement officers,\" the White House's Jackson said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "The administration was making similar arguments to a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in San Francisco, which it's asking to pause a federal judge's order in Oregon over the weekend blocking the state's National Guard from being federalized and deployed.",
      "The \"extraordinary\" order by U.S. District Judge Karen Immergut \u201cimproperly impinges on the Commander in Chief\u2019s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property,\u201d Justice Department attorneys contended in their court filing.",
      "They also noted that the 9th Circuit blocked a similar restraining order this year involving National Guard troops in Los Angeles and held then that the president's judgment about whether troops are needed should get \"a great level of deference.\"",
      "Immergut, a Trump appointee, said in her order that the Portland case is different from the California one, in part because it appears Trump was acting in bad faith with his exaggerated claims of violence in the city, including that it was \"war ravaged\" with \"ICE Facilities under siege from attack by Antifa\" and \"crazy people\" who \"try to burn down buildings, including federal buildings\" every night.",
      "While there had been some violent protests in June, demonstrations \"were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days \u2014 or even weeks \u2014 leading up to the President\u2019s directive on September 27,\" Immergut wrote, describing the protests as mostly \"small and uneventful.\"",
      "\"On September 26, the eve of the President\u2019s directive, law enforcement 'observed approximately 8-15 people at any given time out front of ICE. Mostly sitting in lawn chairs and walking around. Energy was low, minimal activity,'\u201d her order said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A C-SPAN caller made an emotional plea to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Thursday to end the government shutdown, saying that \u201cmy kids could die\u201d if she can\u2019t afford their medication.",
      "The woman, identified as Samantha from Fort Belvoir, Virginia, expressed concerns over what would happen to her family if military service members do not get paid next week. The caller, who was also identified as a Republican, said that she has \u201ctwo medically fragile children\u201d and that her husband \u201cactively serves his country\u201d and had spent two military tours in Afghanistan.",
      "She brought up comments Johnson made Wednesday when asked if he would allow a vote on a bill to provide military members with emergency pay if the shutdown continues. Johnson told reporters that Democrats were \u201cclamoring to get back here and have another vote, because some of them want to get on record and say they\u2019re for paying the troops. We already had that vote. It\u2019s called the CR,\u201d referring to the short-term funding bill that the House passed but Democrats do not support.",
      "\u201cIf we see a lapse in pay come the 15th, my children do not get to get the medication that\u2019s needed for them to live their life, because we live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Samantha told Johnson.",
      "The exchange occurred as Johnson was taking questions live from C-SPAN viewers who called in to the network Thursday morning. According to C-SPAN communications director Howard Mortman, Johnson is the fourth sitting speaker to join the network in studio and take questions from callers, and the first since 2001.",
      "Active-duty military members had been scheduled to be paid on Oct. 15, but if the shutdown continues, they will not receive payments for October work.",
      "Samantha said that she was \u201cvery disappointed in my party, and I\u2019m very disappointed in you.\u201d She pointed out that Johnson had the power to call the House back into session. The House is set to return on Oct. 14.",
      "\u201cI am begging you to pass this legislation,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids could die.\u201d",
      "NBC News reached out to Johnson\u2019s office for comment.",
      "Johnson told Samantha he was \u201cangry because of situations just like yours.\u201d He noted that his congressional district is home to many military families, including families who \u201chave children in health situations like yours.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is what keeps me up at night,\u201d he said. \u201cI want you to hear something very clearly: The Republicans are the ones delivering for you.\u201d",
      "Johnson continued, casting blame on Democrats for not voting for the GOP-backed continuing resolution, which would reopen the government and provide short-term funding at the same levels as before the shutdown began. Democrats have been pushing Republicans to address health care issues first, noting that Affordable Care Act subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year, which would increase the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats are the ones that are preventing you from getting a check. If we did another, a vote on the floor, pay troops, it\u2019s not a lawmaking exercise, because [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer is going to hold that up in the Senate,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "The Senate has failed six times, largely on party lines, to pass two funding bills, the House-passed GOP bill and one from Senate Democrats.",
      "Reached for comment, a Senate Democratic Leadership aide said, \"We have no idea what Speaker Johnson is talking about.\"",
      "The New York Democrat also slammed Republicans in remarks on the Senate floor on Thursday, saying that \"every day that Republicans refuse to negotiate to end this shutdown, the worse it gets for Americans, the clearer it becomes who is fighting for them each day,",
      "our case to fix health care and end the shutdown gets better and better, stronger and stronger, because families are opening their letters showing how high their premiums will climb if Republicans get their way, they\u2019re seeing why this fight matters. It\u2019s about protecting their health care, their bank accounts, their futures.\u201d",
      "Johnson detailed the C-SPAN conversation later Thursday morning during a press briefing, pointing to the shutdown\u2019s impact on military families.",
      "\u201cMany are deployed right now, defending your freedom around the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they left their young families at home. They live paycheck to paycheck. Many of these, these service members, and this is not a game.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "In the beginning of the year, Dr. Terry Wagner\u2019s office manager came to him and said \u201csomething weird is going on.\u201d",
      "For weeks, the office manager told him, Wagner had been quietly underpaid by the insurance company Aetna on a seemingly random selection of higher level claims.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s blatantly disrespectful,\u201d said Wagner, a family medicine doctor who has run a small practice in Hudson, Ohio, for the last 28 years. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they came back to us saying, \u2018Hey, we need more information,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that Aetna just paid the claims as if they\u2019d been billed for a lower level of service.",
      "It\u2019s a practice called \u201cdowncoding.\u201d Insurance companies \u2014 in Wagner\u2019s case, Aetna \u2014 automatically downgrade the claims a doctor sends them to a lower tier of reimbursement, without actually reviewing details about the visit itself.",
      "For Wagner, that means a \u201clevel four\u201d office visit that might yield $170 is being paid as if it\u2019s a \u201clevel three\u201d for about $125. That $45 difference might not seem like much, but when it\u2019s happening on dozens of claims, and to a physician-owned practice like Wagner\u2019s, the damage mounts. \u201cThis can really hit a small company hard, especially if you\u2019re not catching it,\u201d he said.",
      "If the doctor wants to challenge the decision, they have to appeal each claim with documentation defending their medical opinion.",
      "\u201cSome computer program is deciding what my level of care is,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cIf they question my level of care, then ask for my notes. Look at the tests I ordered. Look at my charts.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just Aetna: Other insurers including Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, Humana and Molina Healthcare have all acknowledged downcoding higher level claims for certain office visits, or \u201cadjusting\u201d as it\u2019s sometimes called. This summer, the insurer Cigna Healthcare announced that it will begin downcoding on certain claims starting in October.",
      "The practice of automatic downcoding seems to have taken off in the last few years, as  health care costs soar and insurance companies use third party vendors and AI programs to reduce costs. NBC News spoke to doctors\u2019 offices across numerous specialties from around the country, all of whom rely heavily on office visits \u2014 rather than surgeries and procedures \u2014 for their revenue, and all of whom are experiencing downcoding from insurers.",
      "The problem, doctors say, is that lower and lower reimbursements mean reliable community doctors, like Wagner, could have to make choices that are inherently bad for patients, like cramming more patient visits into a single day to make up for lost revenue, dropping patients on certain insurance plans, or selling their practices altogether.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a break point and it\u2019s like you either see more [patients] and give them less time, or you just give up. It\u2019s exhausting,\u201d Wagner said.",
      "Doctors being downcoded by Aetna are told they are coding visits \u201cat a higher level\u201d compared to their peers. \u201cWe may adjust your payment if the details on the claim don\u2019t support the level of service billed,\u201d a notice reviewed by NBC News says.",
      "A similar letter from Anthem says doctors \u201cwhose coding patterns improve and are no longer identified as an outlier are eligible to be removed from the program.\u201d",
      "Wagner's office estimates he lost over $3,000 to downcoding in the first half of the year, but other doctors across the country have fared far worse.",
      "Anthem started downcoding Missouri dermatologist Dr. Sarah Jensen\u2019s practice almost two years ago, Jensen said, to the tune of nearly $14,000 in lost payment. She's been able to recoup over a third of that through appeals.",
      "\u201cYou almost lose that wherewithal to fight,\u201d she said of the drudgery of filing appeal after appeal. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s kind of their goal I would imagine.\u201d",
      "Jensen said she feels stuck in an impossible situation. She can\u2019t fit any more patient visits into her day without seriously affecting her standard of care, and because she recently opened a second office, simply turning away Anthem patients isn\u2019t a financially viable option right now. (Anthem is Missouri\u2019s largest commercial insurance provider.)",
      "She\u2019s confident she\u2019s billing appropriately and has even asked peers to spot-check her, but the downcodes just keep coming, she said.",
      "A representative for Anthem deferred to AHIP \u2014 a trade association representing the health insurance industry \u2014 for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for AHIP told NBC News that identifying \u201coutlier practices\u201d that are \u201cout of step with their peers\u201d is part of health plans\u2019 efforts to \u201cadvance quality and affordability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese policies are narrowly applied and enable plans to encourage practice patterns consistent with peers and clinical guidelines,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement."

    "story": [
      "As Constance Marie approached her 60th birthday, she had an idea to celebrate the major life milestone.",
      "The actor \u2014 known for her roles in \u201cGeorge Lopez,\u201d \u201cAmerican Family,\u201d \u201cSelena\u201d and \u201cWith Love\u201d \u2014 didn\u2019t want to throw just any party. She wanted to reclaim and learn more about her Mexican culture, while at the same time uplifting her Latino community and raising money for organizations important to her.",
      "That\u2019s when she decided to throw a sesenta\u00f1era, a take on the popular coming-of-age quincea\u00f1era party thrown for young women who turn 15.",
      "Celebrated much like a Sweet Sixteen throughout Latin America and the U.S., a quincea\u00f1era marks a 15-year-old girl\u2019s passage from girlhood to womanhood. In Marie\u2019s case, she multiplied it by four to embrace entering a new decade in her life.",
      "\u201cI had never been to a quincea\u00f1era. Nobody in my family has ever been to one. Nobody in my family has ever had one,\u201d Marie tells TODAY.com. \u201cEver since we did an episode on the \u2018George Lopez\u2019 show where my character throws a quincea\u00f1era for my (on-screen) daughter Masiela, I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, this is the coolest thing! I didn\u2019t know we could do this!\u2019 My family didn\u2019t come from any money or means, so we didn\u2019t even think about it.\u201d",
      "Marie says she can trace her family back to 1853 when they were living in New Mexico. However, throughout generations, she felt like much of their history and culture was stripped away. She, as well as her mother, didn\u2019t grow up speaking Spanish.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t cross the border. The border crossed us,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd along those generations, so many of the cultural touchstones, like Spanish and the traditions, were quietly stolen or robbed from us because we had to assimilate.\u201d",
      "Her work as an actor, she says, has given her the opportunity to celebrate her culture, and review and learn those cultural touchstones that she never grew up with. But she still feels like she has much to absorb.",
      "For her sesenta\u00f1era, she says she spent \u201chours and hours\u201d on YouTube learning about quincea\u00f1era traditions, including wearing an elegant formal dress, the crowning and shoe ceremony to symbolize entering womanhood, and a special dance. Marie didn\u2019t grow up \u201ccrazy religious,\u201d she says, so she didn\u2019t incorporate the Catholic mass and blessings.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 60 years old. I have survived so much and I can make this what I want it to be,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I took what worked for me.\u201d",
      "Marie began documenting the preparation for her sesenta\u00f1era on Instagram, including going dress shopping at Rosy\u2019s Bridal in Los Angeles. She says the shop had just experienced an immigration raid by ICE, and she wanted to support the business in the aftermath. Her followers also saw her pick out her heels and accessories, as well as getting ready for her Sept. 26 party and snippets from the main event.",
      "When it came time for her big reveal, she donned an elegant red dress, inspired by Disney\u2019s first ever Latina princess, Elena of Avalor. Marie happened to voice the character of Do\u00f1a Paloma in the animated series.",
      "\u201cI just remember being at Disneyland and seeing \u2014 oh, it\u2019s going to make me cry \u2014 seeing a Latina princess and her red beautiful dress. And I thought, \u2018Oh, my God, I have to honor this,\u2019\u201d she says, adding that the color\u2019s brightness and boldness gave her confidence.",
      "She then changed into sneakers and a black dress for her \u201cbaile sorpresa,\u201d or surprise dance, which included participation of friends and fellow actors Gina Torres, Lisa Vidal, Angelique Cabral and Diana Maria Riva.",
      "Also included in her festivities was a \u201cbeautiful speech\u201d given by her 16-year-old daughter, Luna. \u201cI was so taken aback by that,\u201d Marie reflects. \u201cSixteen is hard for a young girl, especially with mothers and daughters, but I had to work so hard to not ugly cry and embarrass her because it just made me realize, \u2018Oh, my gosh, she does see me, and I am having a positive impact on her even in these difficult years.\u2019 So that was just so incredibly rewarding.\u201d",
      "There was also a heartwarming moment where Marie had her \u201cshowbiz children\u201d on the dance floor with her.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to celebrate them as well, because they are the future of our representation,\u201d she says. She adds that after 40 years in the entertainment community, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so much feedback from everyone saying, \u2018I grew up with you. Your role as a mother inspired me, or your role as a deaf mother inspired my mother to learn sign language.\u2019 It\u2019s just so amazing the impact that we can have.\u201d",
      "She says her on-screen kids (which included Francia Raisa, Emeraude Toubia, Masiela Lusha and others) from her past projects are not only \u201ctalented and so wonderful,\u201d they\u2019ve truly taught her and made her a better actor and performer.",
      "Among other stand-out moments from the party included a performance by the all-female Mariachi Santa Monica group that sang Selena Quintanilla songs, food catered by La Nena Cantina, Don Julio tequila and a custom-made Loteria card of Marie in her red gown by Viridiana Osio.",
      "While the party aspect of it was a delight, Marie says she wanted to go one step further. She decided to raise awareness and funds for the organizations This Is About Humanity and Immigrant Defenders Law Center. Both nonprofits work together to raise money for immigrant communities who need help, including shelter, legal assistance, food and more.",
      "\u201cI just thought, \u2018OK, if I\u2019m going to do this, I\u2019m going to do this for something that\u2019s bigger than me,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThese two organizations, I have worked with over the years and they are truly angels. They truly do make an impact on so many levels, for our community and for the undocumented immigrants.\u201d",
      "The sesenta\u00f1era was a night to remember, and one that made Marie reflect on the importance of celebrating one\u2019s Latinidad. She also stresses the fact that it\u2019s never too late to discover more about your heritage and ancestry.",
      "\u201cI say to any other women out there: Go have your special day, no matter what it looks like. Quincea\u00f1era, bat mitzvah \u2014 they should have older bat mitzvahs. Why not?\u201d she says. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get your day? Celebrate, reclaim! If it\u2019s your flower ceremony or whatever, I just think we have to be courageous enough to hope right now, and celebrate and uplift. That\u2019s what I was trying to do, and I really, truly urge anybody else to do the same thing.\u201d"

      "Indy (played by an actual retriever named Indy) moves into a farmhouse with his owner, Todd (Shane Jensen). Once owned by Todd's grandfather, the house seems to be haunted by a malevolent entity. Only Indy can see a terrifying dark figure stalking Todd. And so, only Indy can save him.",
      "Below, writer and director Ben Leonberg breaks down what happens to Todd and Indy in the end \u2014 and why, in his mind, it's not a sad ending.",
      "What happens to Todd and Indy at the end of 'Good Boy'?",
      "Turns out there's a lot going on in this house beyond the haunting Indy senses. Todd is dying of an undisclosed illness \u2014 and Indy can't stop it from happening.",
      "As the movie goes on, Todd gets progressively sicker. Eventually, Todd is dragged down by the entity. \u201cYou\u2019re a good dog, but you can\u2019t save me,\u201d Todd says before he dies.",
      "The scenario mimics what we learned happened to Todd's grandfather, who also died of a similar disease. Indy has been seeing the apparition of Bandit, Todd's grandfather's dog who appeared to starve to death in the house.",
      "Indy, meanwhile, has life after Todd's death. He's left in the care of Todd's sister, Vera \u2014 a better fate than Bandit's.",
      "The ending might strike many as emotionally devastating, especially after watching Indy go through so much within a span of 70 minutes. But writer and director Leonberg says he and co-writer Alex Cannon don't see see the movie's conclusion as sad.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t see that the film is necessarily like a sad ending, especially for Indy,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOur film is a bit of an inverse of the typical way that animals in human lives are part of how we learn about more mortality. A lot of us learn about death and dying from pets. I think the film kind of inverts that, and imagines \u2014 what is that experience like, if it\u2019s on the other shoe or paw, so to speak,\u201d Leonberg continues.",
      "Wait, is the house actually haunted?",
      "Indy has sensed, and cowered from, a presence. But is the house actually haunted, or is Indy just responding to the feeling of impending death?",
      "Leonberg says the answer is yes \u2014 to both. \u201cI think horror really works when there is an ambiguity between two things,\u201d Leonberg explains.",
      "Like \u201cThe Shining,\u201d he says the ending\u2019s interpretation can be up to the viewer.",
      "\u201cYou could make an argument there\u2019s nothing supernatural. (The Shining\u2019s) just a story of an alcoholic father trying to murder his family, or there\u2019s a haunted house and he\u2019s becoming possessed,\u201d Leonberg says.",
      "\u201cThe ambiguity between those two things is ultimately what\u2019s so interesting. So I think both of the scenarios you laid out are correct,\" he says."

      "Donna and the Dynamos are back on Broadway in a new production of the beloved musical: \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d",
      "Created by Judy Craymer and written by Catherine Johnson, the hit show is based on the songs of the Swedish supergroup, ABBA, and ran on Broadway from 2001 through 2015.",
      "The popular show also spawned a 2008 movie, starring Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried, a 2018 sequel, and continues touring as one of the most celebrated musicals of all time.",
      "After more than a decade, \u201cMamma Mia\u201d is once again occupying New York\u2019s Winter Garden Theatre and tells the tale of Sophie (Amy Weaver), a young bride-to-be in search of her unknown father, in hopes that he\u2019ll walk her down the aisle.",
      "After reading her mother\u2019s diary, Sophie discovers that her dad could be one of three men and to find out which one, she invites them all to her wedding on the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi (which translates to \"summer\").",
      "When they arrive, it sends her mother, Donna (Christine Sherrill in the new production), into a tailspin as she confronts her former lovers. With the help of her best friends and former bandmates, Tanya (Jalynn Steele) and Rosie (Carly Sakolove), Donna searches for closure while Sophie grapples with her decision to marry Sky (Grant Reynolds), her young fianc\u00e9.",

      "To find out more about the show\u2019s recent return to Broadway, TODAY.com sat down with Sherrill, Steele and Sakolove \u2014 or Donna, Tanya and Rosie, respectively \u2014  to talk about their journey to The Great White Way, their favorite ABBA songs and what they love most about performing in \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d",
      "The Road to Broadway",
      "Prior to playing the title role of Donna Sheridan, Sherrill had been performing on stage for years, but shifted gears when COVID-19 hit. Like many people, the pandemic changed her trajectory and in order to help her youngest son acclimate to a new school, she took a job as a 5th grade algebra teacher.",
      "\u201cI had taught for two years and I wasn\u2019t actively auditioning. I was really loving teaching,\u201d says Sherrill.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until this show called \u2014 because I had a history with this show \u2014 that I thought, \u2018Oh, yes, maybe I\u2019ll just try it and see.\u2019\u201d",
      "Sherrill went for it and hit the road with the national company in fall of 2023. \u201cI ended the school year right before we went out on tour.\u201d",
      "She was joined by Steele, a seasoned performer who made her Broadway debut in the 2019 production of \u201cThe Lightning Thief: The Percy Jackson Musical,\u201d and was working in \u201cMary Poppins\u201d at Tuacahn, an amphitheater in Utah, when she was picked up for \u201cMamma Mia.\u201d",
      "Sakolove, meanwhile, was in an earlier North American tour of \"Mamma Mia\" and part of the Royal Caribbean cruise line's production.",
      "For two years, the trio traveled on the road until this past February, when the call came that changed their lives.",
      "\u201cWe were touring and then they were like, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to go to Broadway.\u2019 We were like, \u2018Wait, what?\u201d says Steele.",
      "Six months later, they opened at the legendary Winter Garden Theatre on Aug. 14.",
      "\u2018Take A Chance\u2019 and Other Favorite Songs",
      "After performing in various \u201cMamma Mia\u201d versions for years, the three women say they love all the songs in the show, but still have a few favorites.",
      "\u201cI love doing \u2018Dancing Queen\u2019 with these ladies. It\u2019s just so much fun and we\u2019re just literally playing around in friendship on the stage,\u201d says Steele. \u201cThen, of course, \u2018Does Your Mother Know\u2019 with Justin (Sudderth). We play off of each other and for me, personally, that\u2019s a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "For Sakolove, it\u2019s the classic \u201cTake A Chance,\u201d and she explains why.",
      "\u201cIt really brings me back to my childhood; that was one of the only ABBA songs that I knew growing up,\u201d says Sakolove, explaining that the other reason she loves the song is that when she was waiting for her callback on the role of Rosie, she heard it playing everywhere she went, like a good omen.",
      "\u201cI think that song is my angel song,\u201d she says.",
      "As for Sherrill, the \u201cMamma Mia\u201d star says she loves singing \u201cChiquitita\u201d because \u201cit\u2019s where I can see that we\u2019ve won the audience over as a trio.\u201d",
      "The other is the ABBA ballad \u201cThe Winner Takes It All,\u201d Sherrill\u2019s powerful solo at the end of the show.",
      "According to Sherrill, it's the hardest of the songs to perform and she was initially daunted by the challenge until she realized that it wasn't about her.",
      "\"(I was) meeting all these other people, they're coming into my DMs or I'm meeting them at the stage door and they're telling me what 'Winner' means to them. And it's something completely different than what it means to me,\" she explains.",
      "It changed her perspective from focusing on how well she technically sang the song to ensuring that it connected with audience instead.",
      "\"I just feel this responsibility to look past how I'm going to sing it and not consider what I'm going to sound like on the money note, but to tell the story the best I can to open up the audience and let them have whatever experience and whatever telling of the story that they need at the moment,\" says Sherrill.",
      "Having a 'Romance' With the Audience",
      "At the heart of \u201cMamma Mia!\u201d is the audience and their journey along with its characters. There are laughs, tears, dancing and a whole lot of singing.",
      "\u201cWe are literally having a romance with our audiences,\u201d says Sherrill. \u201cThey are involved in the show with us from the get-go. It\u2019s incredible and we\u2019re really lucky to be doing this show right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like medicine,\u201d agrees Sakolove.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a party. Like, let\u2019s get up and celebrate and have some fun,\u201d says Steele. \u201cAny time I see the audience, when they\u2019re raring to go, you feel it. You feel that energy. You feel that they\u2019re coming here for a celebration because that\u2019s essentially what it is.\u201d",
      "And when the audience is up on their feet and singing along, Sherrill, Sakolove and Steele say that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re telling a wonderful story about friendship and love and joy,\u201d Steele says. \u201cSo, when you feel that from the audience, we appreciate it so much. We\u2019re like, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to stop.\u2019\u201d",

      "Twenty-five years ago, \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d officially took the season of fall hostage.",
      "The light-hearted dramedy followed the lives of fast-talking, coffee-obsessed and quirky mother-daughter duo Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel), who lived in the cozy and close-knit town of Stars Hollow.",
      "Created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d premiered on Oct. 5, 2000. The show aired for seven seasons from 2000 to 2007, first on The WB before it switched to The CW. Nine years after the series ended, the stars of the show reprised their roles for the Netflix four-part miniseries \u201cGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\u201d",
      "Over two decades later, the show has become a pop culture phenomenon, with fans rewatching the hit show year after year, especially when days get shorter and temperatures drop.",
      "In recent months, the nostalgia has hit a high after Graham and Bledel reunited at the 2025 Emmys. Earlier this month, a handful of actors were by Graham's side when she got her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Scott Patterson, known as Luke Danes, spoke with TODAY.com about supporting his former on-screen love interest, why he's rewatching every episode again on his iHeartRadio \u201cI Am All In...Again! with Scott Patterson\" podcast, and where he envisions Luke, Lorelai and Rory would be up to in a reunion special.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "It's so awesome to celebrate the 25th anniversary of 'Gilmore Girls.' How was it reuniting with Lauren Graham and other cast members at her Walk of Fame ceremony?",
      "It was such a fun day. What a great occasion. Much deserved for Lauren, great to be there by her side and supporting her. She's a star of that show and just did a remarkable job with that character. (I) always, always support her whenever I can.",
      "This year is a milestone year for the show. Have you been reconnecting more with former castmates or have you always stayed in touch?",
      "I keep in touch with as many people as possible. I do a lot of conventions so I\u2019m always seeing Sean (Gunn) or some other cast members that do conventions. Not everybody does them.  I keep pretty plugged in.",
      "It\u2019s not like we\u2019re on a \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d cast group chat. But if we do a new project, we\u2019ll get some text messages, \u201cHey, saw the new thing. Great. Let\u2019s get together.\u201d Those kinds of things. So it\u2019s always nice and Lauren\u2019s gathering was a chance to reconnect with some people.",
      "Tell me about rewatching 'Gilmore Girls' for a second time on your podcast, 'I Am All In... Again!', and how you are feeling about it?",
      "We\u2019re on the second go-around. We just finished recapping Season 3, Episode 1, and it\u2019s where Christopher (David Sutcliffe) and Sherry (M\u00e4dchen Amick) are pregnant. Lorelei and Christopher will not be getting together. Emily (Kelly Bishop) and Richard (Edward Herrmann) do not know and when they find out, they ridicule Lorelai and she limps into the diner trying to heal our rift because we weren\u2019t talking. We had a big blowout.",
      "I love this scene where she comes in and says, \u201cDon\u2019t see me as Lorelai. If you don\u2019t want to talk to me, I\u2019m Nancy or Minnie or whoever... I just need to talk.\u201d So she sat down, talked and got emotional.",
      "The beauty of that scene, for me, is how vulnerable she is and how clever she is to come in and say she needs to talk to me so much, she needs her friend so much that she's willing to do it under a pseudonym, which is really funny. Then just watching Luke kind of melt. His heart is reopening again.",
      "I love the writing on this show. It\u2019s so special that we got to do that every day. Let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s the cherry on top of the cake of all of our careers. We\u2019ll never outdo this show. There will never be another \u201cGilmore Girls\u201d and these characters are going to live forever. So (I\u2019m) very lucky in that regard, I feel very, very grateful to be a part of this 25-year phenomenon. And let\u2019s raise our glasses to 25 more years.",
      "What is something new that you are doing this time around?",
      "There\u2019s a new segment I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s called \u201cThis Is Not Old Man Music.\u201d We\u2019re doing the music of the show.  I just interviewed Sister Sledge, which was an amazing interview. But we\u2019re going to be talking about the music of the show, the musicians and stars.",
      "We're just going to do what the fans do. We're going to keep re-watching, sharing new insights, new opinions. We're just having a blast doing it.",
      "Would you be up for another 'Gilmore Girls' reunion?",
      "Oh, yeah, I think they could twist my arm (laughs).",
      "What would you picture Luke doing?",
      "Same. I think that\u2019s the beauty of the characters, is they don\u2019t change. I think that\u2019s what fans want and that\u2019s really how it should be. I don\u2019t think Luke has changed, he\u2019s just gotten a little older. I don\u2019t think Lorelai\u2019s changed.",
      "I don\u2019t think, especially in Luke and Lorelai\u2019s case, that you want to change them too much. You really don\u2019t. I think that\u2019s why people love them. They\u2019re their own people. They have their own strength. They don\u2019t need each other, but they want each other and they\u2019re willing to span that bridge to get to one another and do all that it takes.",
      "But she's maybe a grandma, according to the ending of 'A Year in the Life.'",
      "Well, she is \u2014 and (maybe) she's been one for eight years, yeah. And maybe (she's) a mother, who knows? I don't know. I don't want to start rumors.",
      "Rory's boyfriends have been a big part of the show. Jared Padalecki and Matt Czuchry did a Panera commercial together, Lauren called out Milo Ventimiglia and Jared for not being at her Walk of Fame and said, 'Points for Logan.' What team are you now?",
      "I'm team none of them. I like them all as people. But as characters, I think Rory, once she gets her act together, and she probably has by now, she's been a mother for eight years, I think there's going to be a new energy coming into her life and a new person \u2014 and maybe she's already found someone!",
      "So if there is a new iteration or Christmas special, maybe we meet this person. They've been together for, you know, seven years or eight years. Or maybe she's been a single mother and she meets somebody. Maybe it's a guy who just opened a diner somewhere (laughs). I'll leave the creative writing to the creative writing team.",
      "I know there's a documentary coming out, are you involved?",
      "Yeah, (I have) nothing to do with it. They never came to me and made a deal."

      "\u201cWhen you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.\u201d",
      "\"To see how much s--- it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared,\" he continued. \u201cLeft wing or right wing we\u2019re all one bird and American. To be clear I\u2019m on neither of these radical sides.\"",
      "\"To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe just know I\u2019m trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes\" he added.",
      "Bryan later shared another message, writing, \"I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we\u2019ve faced in the last few months!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Charlie Hunnam\u2019s portrayal of killer Ed Gein in a new Netflix series has viewers talking, especially about the voice he chose to adopt for the chilling TV show.",
      "\u201cMonster: The Ed Gein Story\" is a dark tale about Gein, a mid-20th century killer whose crimes inspired several horror films, including \"Psycho\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\"",
      "In the Netflix series, Hunnam speaks in a voice that some viewers have described as sounding like Winnie the Pooh. What motivated the actor's approach and how did Gein sound in real life? We're breaking it all down.",
      "How Did Charlie Hunnam Invent the Ed Gein Voice in 'Monster'?",
      "\u201cMonster: The Ed Gein Story,\u201d which premiered on Oct. 3, finds Hunnam using a soft voice and often speaking slowly.",
      "In an interview with Variety, the actor described his approach, saying, \"The voice needed to be really specific.\u201d",
      "Hunnam admitted that no one working on the TV series \"really had an idea of what that was\" at first, especially since audio recordings of Gein are few and far between.",
      "Hunnam said the voice ultimately came from Gein's relationship with his mother, Augusta Gein. \u201cI started to see him through a series of affectations to please his mother. That\u2019s where the voice came from,\" he told Variety.",
      "In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Hunnam elaborated on his inspiration, saying he wanted to portray Gein's \"soul and spirit and trauma and struggle in the way he communicates with the world.\"",
      "\"There's just this constant desire for acceptance and I thought that a lot of his behavior would grow inauthentically out of his desire to be the person that he thought his mother wanted him to be and that was as much like a girl as possible,\" the actor said.",
      "Hunnam admitted that it took \"courage\" to take this approach \"because I felt like this voice is going to feel inauthentic and it's not going to feel like it belongs in his body.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein's Voice Really Sound Like?",
      "In his book \u201cDeviant,\u201d Schechter described Gein\u2019s voice, writing that a hospital social worker said Gein talked \"freely in a low voice, frequently with his head in his hands.\"",
      "The author also noted \"the softness of his voice\" and \"the meekness of his posture.\"",
      "While describing a press interview Gein gave in a courthouse, the author said he used \"a voice so quiet that the reporters in the back of the room had trouble hearing him.\"",
      "As for how to hear Gein's voice for yourself? In 2023, the documentary series \u201cPsycho: The Lost Tapes of Ed Gein\u201d also featured recordings of Gein\u2019s voice. The documentary is available to stream on MGM+.",
      "How Have Viewers Responded?",
      "After watching \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\u201d many viewers have expressed confusion over Hunnam's voice and wondered if Gein really spoke like that.",
      "One YouTube user left the following comment on a video that played a recording of Gein's real voice: \"Had to come check out the real voice because I knew damn well there was no way he sounded like Winnie the Pooh.\"",
      "\"How many other people came here after the new series of monsters came out, to see if the voice matched,\" another wrote.",
      "Another left the following reaction: \"He sounds so simple and innocuous. It's no wonder no one suspected what he was really capable of.\"",
      "One viewer said Hunnam's voice in the show \"is so different\" since Gein's real voice \"is much deeper.\"",
      "Over on X, many social media users also weighed in on the voice, with one commenting, \"I don\u2019t know if I can get through 8 hours of Charlie Hunnam and his Ed Gein voice.\"",
      "Some viewers applauded the actor for the added element of creepiness his voice lent to the role.",
      "\"Charlie hunnam\u2019s voice for ed gein sounds like winnie the pooh but i actually dont hate it at all, it honestly makes his performance more unsettling,\" one wrote.",
      "Some viewers have started to imitate Hunnam's voice in TikTok videos. One such video was captioned, \"ed gein is our whole personality now.\"",
      "Many X users agreed, including one who commented, \"Can\u2019t stop doing the Ed Gein voice from Monster.\""

    "story": [
      "It's no surprise that Melissa Joan Heart, who portrayed the title character in \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" for seven seasons, loves Halloween. But she really loves Halloween \u2014 and as a former teenage witch, this mom of three knows how to make holidays magical.",
      "\"I've gotten in trouble once before because I take the day off,\" Hart tells TODAY.com. \"I'm like, 'I am not working on Halloween.' As long as my kids want to trick-or-treat, I am going.\"",
      "The busy mom, who is married to musician Mark Wilkerson, is raising their three sons: Mason, 19, Braydon, 16, and Tucker, 12. When Mason announced that he was going trick-or-treating last year, Hart dropped everything to join him.",
      "\"I really get into the costumes,\" Hart says. \"I was somehow able to magically manipulate their costumes every year for many years into a family costume.\"",
      "Some of her favorites were the years they went as Pinocchio, Megamind and the Three Amigos.",
      "\"We watched the (\"Three Amigos\") movie in May. They were all really into that movie and mimicked it all the time, so I was able to hold on to it until October,\" Hart says. But it wasn't an easy costume to create. \"I burned my fingers hot gluing rickrack onto sombreros!\"",
      "In Hart's house, Halloween candy often takes a backseat to their favorite treat: popcorn. She recently scored a year's worth of the salty snack as the \"Chief of Butter\" for Pop Secret\u2019s \u201cSpill Everything\u201d campaign. It encourages people to share their popcorn-worthy confessions \u2014 and hear Hart\u2019s \u2014 via the Pop Secret Hotline.",
      "In not-so-secret news, Hart boasts, \"A few years ago, I had the greatest parenting moment. I was able to introduce my son to his hero, Jay Weinberg.\"",
      "Weinberg was the drummer for the metal band Slipknot. Partly because Hart married a musician, music is a huge way she and her husband bond with the kids. So when Hart's oldest son Mason wanted to be Weinberg for Halloween, she was all-in.",
      "\"It was a process of finding the right wig, the tattoo, the uniform, sewing patches on the uniform and then getting the mask,\" she explains. \"My friend Kelly Osborne helped me get the mask.\"",
      "Yes, she means the Kelly Osborne, daughter of Sharon and Ozzy Osborne. Kelly's fianc\u00e9 is Sid Wilson, another member of Slipknot.",
      "After receiving a genuine Slipknot mask in a care package from the Osborne family, Hart posted an images of Mason's costume on social media and tagged both Osborne and Weinberg. As luck would have it, Weinberg commented, leading to a DM conversation \u2014 and since he lives near Hart in Nashville, she invited him over for dinner to surprise Mason.",
      "It's one thing to shock your Spider-Man-loving toddler with a \"real\" Spider-Man, but introducing your 17-year-old son to his favorite musician is quite another.",
      "\"I got to be a hero for a day!\" she says."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's announcement that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "The plan, which was mediated by Qatar, Turkey and Egypt, will also need formal agreement at 5 p.m. local time Thursday (10 a.m. ET) by Israel's government, an Israel official briefed on the matter told NBC News. That does not appear a sure thing, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowing to vote against it.",
      "A spokesperson for the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that a ceasefire would then take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Trump said in a social media post Wednesday that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium- and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Despite being headlined by a genuine star and staged at one of London\u2019s premier theaters, a play about the foundation of a sprawling and troubled public service seemed unlikely to provoke night after night of standing ovations.",
      "But that\u2019s what happened with \u201cNye,\u201d an unlikely hit about the creator, and origin story, of Britain\u2019s taxpayer-funded National Health Service.",
      "The play, written by Tim Price and directed by Rufus Norris, came at an inflection point for the NHS, as it\u2019s known. Almost 80 years after it was founded, the medical service once touted as the envy of the world is \u201cbroken\u201d and suffering the \u201cbiggest crisis in its history,\u201d the government says. The crisis at this national bedrock is part of a bigger malaise at the heart of British culture: rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m terrified, not just for the NHS, but for the whole of our society,\u201d Michael Sheen, who starred as Aneurin \u201cNye\u201d Bevan, the founder of the NHS, told NBC News in an interview. \u201cOnce it\u2019s torn down, then I guess people will think about what they\u2019ve lost.\u201d",
      "Sheen, 56, better known to international audiences as Tony Blair in \u201cThe Queen,\u201d David Frost in \u201cFrost/Nixon\u201d and the angel Aziraphale in the Amazon Prime series \u201cGood Omens,\u201d has spent much of the last two years honing his portrayal of Bevan, the socialist politician who dragged himself out of Wales\u2019 coal mines to will the NHS into existence.",
      "Though second nature to Brits, the ideal of the NHS is unfamiliar to many Americans: British people have universally free health care at the point of access \u2014 from ambulances attending car accidents to insulin for diabetes to cancer care to childbirth. Though some people do have private insurance, the idea of having to choose between illness and financial ruin is shocking in the U.K.",
      "Now, the Labour Party, which created the then-radical NHS in 1948, is battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity. It has a colossal task if it is to fix the crumbling hospitals replete with overworked doctors and bed-lined corridors.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer must turn around a behemoth whose budget of 200 billion English pounds ($269 billion) represents some 40% of all government spending, and whose 1.4 million employees are the world\u2019s seventh-largest workforce. In the United States, only the Department of Defense, Walmart and Amazon employ more people.",
      "Through all this, the core NHS ideal endures. Everyone in the U.K. has a story of a relative, or themselves, receiving the type of world-class care that puts a terrifying financial strain on millions of Americans. (In the past six years, this reporter\u2019s mother has had a single mastectomy and reconstruction, as well as three titanium plates in a shattered ankle, without having to pay a pound for the care.)",
      "But just as common are the tales of maddening, hourslong waits in overstretched emergency rooms, or weeklong delays just to see a community general practitioner. Many critics blame the sprawling crisis on years of underfunding by the now-ousted Conservative government of 2010-24, whose response to the 2008 financial crisis was to make drastic cuts to public services.",
      "It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that a largely liberal London-theatergoing audience responded with applause and tears at the hagiography of Bevan at the National Theater. Though relatively unknown in wider society, admirers see Bevan as a founding father of modern Britain; his ideal of the NHS today is not just popular, it defines the country itself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s far from perfect,\u201d said Alison Ferris, 40, a nurse at a hospital in Canterbury, in southeast England. \u201cBut I do the best that I can for anyone that comes in front of me. I treat every patient like I would treat my loved ones.\u201d",
      "Though the concept remains revered, public satisfaction in the NHS in practice cratered to 52% in 2023 from a high of 70% in 2010, according to the King\u2019s Fund, a top think tank tracking British health care.",
      "\u201cWe have to fight for the NHS, the same as the NHS was fought for when it was created,\u201d said Ferris\u2019 mother, Caroline Heggie, 70, a hospital union representative, who like her daughter had come to see the last night of \u201cNye\u201d at the National Theater last month. \u201cWe can\u2019t go the way of privatization, we can\u2019t go the way of America. That\u2019s what we\u2019re up against.\u201d",
      "Like Bevan, Sheen is a Welsh firebrand unafraid to wear his leftist politics. But he also lived for 14 years in Los Angeles, so knows too well what life is like without socialized health care.",
      "\u201cThe idea of this health care system that we have here, just seemed so alien to them over there,\u201d Sheen, who now lives back in his Welsh hometown of Port Talbot, says of his former American hosts. He says that \u201cseeing people go into hospitals with serious injuries or illnesses, and being asked to produce their checkbook before they can be treated\u201d would shock most Britons.",
      "The crisis at the NHS coincides with an uptick in hostility toward immigrants \u2014 even though they are often people\u2019s doctors, nurses and hospital cleaners. Almost 20% of NHS staff have a non-British nationality, with Indians, Filipinos, Nigerians, Irish and Poles making up most of their number.",
      "Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform U.K. party and an ally and friend of President Donald Trump, is leading some polls to become Britain\u2019s next prime minister. He has become the first prospective leader to question the funding model of using taxes to fund the NHS \u2014 historically taboo.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work \u2014 it\u2019s not working,\u201d Farage told NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News in May. \u201cWe\u2019re getting worse bang for the buck than any other country, particularly out of those European neighbors.\u201d",
      "Opposing Farage\u2019s proposal, however, leaves open the specter of privatization, which many say has been creeping up even before the Health and Social Care Act 2012 opened up the NHS to bids from private contractors.",
      "Farage isn\u2019t the only person dissatisfied. Indeed, the NHS has slipped from being a world leader on many metrics.",
      "\u201cCorridor care\u201d is now a year-round crisis, and the number of people waiting 12 hours or more to be admitted into an emergency room rose from 47 in summer 2015 to 74,150 this summer. Targets have lagged for years in everything from ambulance attendance times to cancer diagnoses. Meanwhile, a 7 million-strong waiting list means many people feel abandoned for months, in pain, before getting hip or knee replacement and other types of surgery.",
      "There is ample evidence to suggest that economic austerity policies imposed during 14 years of Conservative Party rule are at least partly to blame, according to Max Warner, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a London research group.",
      "\u201cIt is true that a lot of NHS performance measures over the 2010s were broadly getting worse, having started off relatively well,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough it\u2019s worth saying that productivity did grow, so it\u2019s a nuanced picture and causality is difficult.\u201d",
      "The Conservatives argued that they kept NHS spending up, protecting it from the brutal cuts that crushed almost every other government department at the time. But this 2% yearly growth still fell well short of the 3.8% yearly average since the 1980s, and, according to critics, was insufficient to cope with an aging population and the rising prices of cutting-edge drugs.",
      "Far from the envy of the world, Britain has been scrimping by spending 37 billion pounds ($53 billion) on the health services each year, well below Germany, France and Australia, a landmark review found last year.",
      "The current Labour government has outlined plans to raise spending to around 3% \u2014 an improvement but still short of what many advocates had hoped. At his annual Labour Party conference this week, Starmer announced that a digital overhaul named NHS Online would launch in 2027, describing it as \u201ca new chapter in the story of our NHS.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, whatever the model, cash is key, according to Roy Lilley, who ran an NHS hospital in the 1990s as chairman of Homewood NHS Trust in Surrey, west of London.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how you pay for your health care,\u201d said Lilley, today a consultant whose newsletter hits 300,000 inboxes. \u201cWhether you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018insurance,\u2019 or you take it out of your pocket marked \u2018taxes,\u2019 it\u2019s still your trousers.\u201d",
      "He remains optimistic, however, pointing to some waiting metrics improving and a general recovery from the hammerblow of the pandemic, which drained resources and mentally scarred doctors.",
      "Still, Sheen \u2014 never shy to mix acting with activism \u2014 believes it\u2019s no coincidence that the NHS is in crisis just when its origin story begins to vanish from living memory.",
      "\u201cThe crisis that we seem to be experiencing makes it all the more important to go back to the beginning and to look at what was behind the founding of the NHS, and what the principles were,\u201d he said. \u201cIt becomes incredibly important to tell the story of it and to remind people of what it was actually like, so that we don\u2019t forget.\u201d"

      "The humble soybean is the latest flashpoint in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to reshape global trade.",
      "Used in everything from animal feed to fuel, soybeans regularly rank among the most valuable U.S. agricultural exports, towering over higher-profile crops like corn and cotton.",
      "More than $30 billion worth of American soybean products were exported in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "For American soybean farmers, their top overseas market has long been China, which bought around a third of the export crop \u2014 approximately $12 billion worth of American soybean products \u2014 in the last calendar year, USDA data shows.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war leaves U.S.-China relations somewhere between frosty and openly hostile, America\u2019s soybean farmers appear to be an early casualty.",
      "An embargo in all but name",
      "So far, China has not purchased any U.S. soybeans during this year\u2019s main harvest period, with sales falling to zero in May.",
      "This has pushed many American farmers reliant on soybeans nearly to the breaking point.",
      "It has also complicated the Trump administration\u2019s plans to provide billions in foreign economic aid to Argentina.",
      "Buenos Aires recently sold more than 2.5 million metric tons of soybeans to Beijing, after briefly suspending its export tax on the soy products.",
      "U.S. officials blame China for the looming crisis facing American soybean producers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate the Chinese leadership has decided to use the American farmers, soybean farmers in particular, as a hostage or pawn in the trade negotiations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday on CNBC.",
      "Farmers view the situation differently, however. They want Trump to reach a trade deal with China that ends the unofficial embargo on soybeans. But instead, what they see is the White House preparing to bail out one of their chief rivals for the Chinese export market.",
      "\u201cThe frustration is overwhelming,\u201d American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said in a recent statement.",
      "Meanwhile, China \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest buyer of soybeans \u2014indicated last week that it won\u2019t resume U.S. purchases unless more Trump tariffs are lifted.",
      "\u201cAs for soybean trade, the U.S. side should take proactive steps to remove relevant unreasonable tariffs, create conditions for expanding bilateral trade, and inject more stability and certainty into global economic development,\u201d Commerce Ministry spokesperson He Yadong told reporters in Beijing.",
      "Emergency relief is coming",
      "The Trump administration will announce new support for farmers, \u201cespecially the soybean farmers,\u201d on Tuesday, Bessent said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re also going to be working with the Farm Credit Bureau to make sure that the farmers have what they need for the next planting season,\u201d he added.",
      "Bessent personally owns as much as $25 million worth of farmland in North Dakota that produces corn and soybeans, according to his recent financial disclosures.",
      "He said soybeans would be a topic of discussion at the upcoming meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum later this month.",
      "Trump is also aware of the impact his trade policies are having on American farmers, starting with soybean growers.",
      "\u201cThe Soybean Farmers of our Country are being hurt because China is, for \u2018negotiating\u2019 reasons only, not buying,\u201d the president posted Wednesday on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve made so much money on Tariffs, that we are going to take a small portion of that money, and help our Farmers,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The question is whether this aid will come soon enough to save this year\u2019s massive harvest of soybeans.",
      "At the center of the firestorm is Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, who warned this week that \u201cthis moment of uncertainty in the farm economy is real.\u201d Speaking on Fox Business Network, she emphasized that Trump has long supported U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and Secretary Rollins are always in touch about the needs of our farmers, who played a crucial role in the President\u2019s November victory,\u201d the White House said in a statement Thursday. \u201cHe has made clear his intention to use tariff revenue to help our agricultural sector, but no final decisions on the contours of this plan have been made.\u201d",
      "The Argentina factor",
      "The current U.S.-China stalemate over soybean exports is also complicating another American foreign policy conundrum: what to do about Argentina\u2019s faltering economy.",
      "As U.S. soybean exports to China screech to a halt, Argentina\u2019s farmers jumped at the opportunity to sell China their own soybeans.",
      "From their perspective, a potential U.S. economic aid package has nothing to do with their soybean exports, and everything to do with the personal and political alliance between Trump and libertarian President Javier Milei.",
      "Milei was the first foreign leader to visit Trump after his 2024 election victory, and he has become a familiar face at U.S. political events attended by the president\u2019s MAGA supporters.",
      "At a Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C. in February, Milei gifted then-Department of Government Efficiency chief Elon Musk a red chainsaw.",
      "Musk then waved it around onstage, calling it \u201cthe chainsaw for bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "Eight months later, Milei\u2019s popularity with voters has plunged, raising doubts about the future of his market-friendly economic reforms and strict austerity measures.",
      "Local elections in early September dealt a blow to Milei\u2019s party, triggering massive turmoil in Argentina\u2019s stock and currency markets.",
      "A few weeks after the market plunge, Bessent announced on social media that the U.S. was prepared to deploy billions of dollars to support the South American country.",
      "A presidential delegation from Buenos Aires is expected to visit the White House next week to finalize the U.S. foreign aid deal.",
      "This has infuriated the soybean farmers.",
      "\u201cU.S. soybean prices are falling, harvest is underway, and farmers read headlines not about securing a trade agreement with China, but that the U.S. government is extending $20 billion in economic support to Argentina while that country drops its soybean export taxes to sell 20 shiploads of Argentine soybeans to China in just two days,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "Meanwhile, Milei has also secured a currency swap line for Argentina from China, a situation that gives pause to some in Washington.",
      "In response, Milei has said Argentina will maintain its mutually beneficial trade and economic relationship with China.",
      "Tensions inside the Trump administration over China, Argentina and the soybean farmers broke into the open last week.",
      "While attending the U.N. General Assembly, Bessent received a text message from a contact labeled \u201cBR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe bailed out Argentina yesterday \u2026 and in return, the Argentine\u2019s removed their export tariff on grains, reducing their price, and sold a bunch of soybeans to China at a time when we would normally be selling to China,\u201d read the message, widely presumed to come from Rollins.",
      "\u201cSoy prices are dropping further because of it. This gives China more leverage on us,\u201d the message concluded.",
      "Spokespeople for Bessent and Rollins did not respond to questions about the text message exchange."

      "But two that have eluded him potentially mean the most to his legacy and his dogged pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "The first is the Russia-Ukraine war, which is no closer to ending now than when Trump took office in January. The other is Israel\u2019s conflict with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Here, he may have just achieved a breakthrough.",
      "Up against a Sunday deadline that Trump had set, Hamas said Friday that it would meet a major condition that the president laid out in his 20-point plan for the war\u2019s end: releasing all the hostages, living or dead. Hamas\u2019 caveat was that \u201cthe field conditions for the exchange are met.\u201d",
      "Hamas also said it was prepared to enter into negotiations and turn over administrative control of Gaza to a Palestinian body of technocrats.",
      "Trump had been waiting on an answer from Hamas since Monday, when he released his peace plan at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He took Hamas\u2019 announcement as a good sign.",
      "\u201cBased on the Statement just issued by Hamas, I believe they are ready for a lasting PEACE,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cIsrael must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the Hostages out safely and quickly!\u201d",
      "Ruby Chen, a hostage family member and a leading advocate, told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s a positive \u2014 we have cautious optimism. We know the president cares a lot about the hostages, so let\u2019s hope this is our time.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not done. There are still a lot of missing pieces, but it\u2019s positive,\u201d he added.",

      "The Middle East is a part of the world where conflict seems eternal, peace sporadic. Since President Harry Truman recognized the Jewish state in 1948, many presidents have tried to usher in peaceful relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, only to see conflict erupt again and again.",
      "Like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and others before him, Trump is working to negotiate an accord among longtime combatants \u2014 an effort that dovetails with the White House\u2019s public campaign to get him the Nobel Peace Prize.",

      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do,\u201d said a former Western diplomat with experience in the Middle East. \u201cHamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases. Trump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019 bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",

      "The diplomat acknowledged that as with any deal of this kind, the details and terms need to be worked out as the process moves forward.",
      "Even if Trump succeeds where his predecessors failed and creates conditions for Palestinians and Israelis to live together peacefully, a Nobel Peace Prize would still be a long shot.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Trump administration for launching deadly attacks on alleged foreign drug boats. Though he has embraced the title \u201cPresident of Peace,\u201d Trump just rebranded the Defense Department as the \u201cDepartment of War.\u201d",

      "Trump was calling.",
      "With the hair dryers whirring, Tybring-Gjedde said he had trouble hearing. The president thanked him for nominating him for the prize, Tybring-Gjedde said in an interview.",
      "Earlier this summer, Trump called another Norwegian, former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, and during the conversation also brought up the prize.",

      "A phone call may not sway anyone, but the Nobel judges would be hard-pressed to defy a president who brokered a Middle East peace deal at long last, Trump\u2019s supporters say.",

      "It comes as Israel and Hamas appear to be inching closer to implementing a 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump.",
      "Asked by moderator Kristen Welker whether the peace negotiations mark the end of the war in Gaza, Rubio said, \u201cNot yet.\u201d",

      "\u201cEveryone has agreed, including Israel, that eventually, at some point here as this process plays out, Gaza will be governed by a Palestinian technocratic group that\u2019s not Hamas, that are not terrorists, with the help and the assistance and the guidance of an international consortium like the board of peace,\u201d Rubio said, echoing the language of the proposed peace plan.",
      "At the same time, Rubio said, \u201cYou can\u2019t set up a governance structure in Gaza that\u2019s not Hamas in three days.\u201d",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly backed the peace plan, which includes the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas, during a visit to the White House last week.",
      "Hamas has expressed a willingness to release all hostages, alive or dead, and plans to send a team on Sunday to Cairo, where more in-depth negotiations are slated to begin on Monday.

      "There are ongoing talks to determine logistically how hostages could be released, he said.",
      "\u201cYou have to make sure the Red Cross can get there, what time they\u2019re going to be there, where they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAll that has to be worked through.\u201d",
      "Asked whether hostages could be released as early as this week, Rubio said, \u201cWe want it to be as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that Israel agreed to withdraw to an initial line cutting through Gaza in order for the hostage deal to move forward. The initial withdrawal line, marked by a yellow line in a graphic posted by Trump, would withdraw the Israeli military to the outskirts of several major cities.",
      "Before Israel withdraws further, Rubio noted that the parties had to determine who would take control of the territory.",
      "\u201cWhen we ask Israel, \u2018OK, you\u2019re at the yellow line, now everything behind it you have to turn it over,\u2019 You have to have somebody to turn it over to,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, I mean, let\u2019s be realistic here. You can\u2019t just set up a sort of new governance structure inside of Gaza in 72 hours.\u201d"

      "Neither Israel\u2019s prime minister\u2019s office nor the Ministry for Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Robinson said he had accepted the invitation and that he would travel to Israel \u201cimmediately following my October 13th trial.\u201d",

      "Robinson was first jailed in 2005 for assaulting an off-duty police officer and ordered to do community service in 2011 for leading a brawl involving more than 100 soccer fans. He was imprisoned again in 2013 for traveling to the United States on another person\u2019s passport, then again a year later for mortgage fraud.",
      "Robinson, who took his pseudonym from a soccer hooligan, was also given a five-year stalking protection order in October 2021 after he shouted abuse outside the home of a journalist, having learned she was planning a story about him.",
      "During that time, he co-founded the English Defence League, or EDL, which rose out of a disparate network of far-right groups and whose virulently Islamophobic views were praised by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik, who killed 77 people in Norway\u2019s worst peacetime atrocity in July 2011 and has frequently made Nazi salutes when attending court.",

      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a longtime informal adviser to Trump, said in an interview with NBC News on Friday that the president has held a vision for the Middle East that includes progress for Israel and Arab nations since he first took office in 2017 and that his insistence on wrangling an apology from Netanyahu for Israeli strikes in Qatar demonstrated his commitment to that view.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is, first of all, a very subtle, complex set of relationships being nurtured by the president with a continued emphasis on a better future,\u201d Gingrich said.",
      "If a peace agreement \u201cactually happens,\u201d Gingrich added, it could put Trump in league with President Theodore Roosevelt, who negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war in the early part of the 20th century, and that \u201cwould have a substantial impact\u201d on the perception of Trump in the U.S.",
      "A senior Arab diplomat told NBC News that the Hamas response is \u201cpositive,\u201d adding: \u201cThey had no choice but to accept.\u201d",
      "But a former Western diplomat with experience in the region told NBC News that the plan could still fall apart.",
      "\u201cThis may be the beginning of the end, but there is still more work to do. Hamas has not accepted key elements of the plan nor the timeframe for hostage releases,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cTrump\u2019s call on Israel to halt strikes will call Hamas\u2019s bluff over the coming days. It\u2019s now up to Hamas. We either see hostages coming out this week or the war will restart.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s peace plan was met with cautious optimism earlier in the week by leaders elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world.",
      "Muslim powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan and Turkey welcomed the plan in a joint statement calling Trump\u2019s efforts \u201csincere.\u201d",
      "The proposal also received support from Europe, with countries that had recently defied Washington by formally recognizing Palestinian statehood welcoming the initiative.",
      "But hours after Trump announced the plan, Netanyahu reiterated his past vows to oppose Palestinian statehood.",
      "\u201cInstead of Hamas isolating us, we turned the tables and isolated Hamas,\u201d he said in Hebrew in a video discussing his U.S. trip.",
      "The developments come on the eve of the second anniversary of the fighting, which began with the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in the past two years."

    "published": "Sat, 04 Oct 2025 10:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Alibaba announced a new initiative aiming to reach AI superintelligence, heating up an arms race with American AI companies.",
    "story": [
      "Early last week in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, a slick, larger-than-life video screen beamed out four words that would drive tech giant Alibaba\u2019s stock to historic levels and signal a shift in China\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence: \u201cRoadmap to Artificial Superintelligence.\u201d",
      "During his 23-minute keynote address at the flagship Alibaba Cloud conference, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu charted out a future featuring artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial superintelligence (ASI). These terms point to a theorized era in which AI becomes roughly as smart as humans (AGI) and then much, much smarter (ASI).",
      "While these terms have been tossed around Silicon Valley for years, Wu\u2019s presentation was notable: Alibaba is now the first established Chinese tech giant to explicitly invoke AGI and ASI.",
      "\u201cAchieving AGI \u2014 an intelligent system with general human-level cognition \u2014 now appears inevitable. Yet AGI is not the end of AI\u2019s development, but its beginning,\u201d Wu said. \u201cIt will march toward ASI \u2014 intelligence beyond the human, capable of self-iteration and continuous evolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cASI will drive exponential technological leaps, carrying us into an unprecedented age of intelligence,\u201d Wu said, highlighting ASI\u2019s ability to help cure diseases, discover cleaner sources of energy and even unlock interstellar travel.",
      "The U.S. and China are the world\u2019s leading AI powers, each with immense computing capabilities and top-tier researchers developing cutting-edge systems. Yet observers have framed the countries as having different approaches to AI, with perceptions that China focuses more on real-world AI applications.",
      "For example, commentators recently argued that Beijing is currently \u201cwinning the race for AI robots\u201d against the U.S., as China is home to much of the world\u2019s most advanced robotics supply chains and a growing network of robotics, or embodied AI, labs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been some commentary in Western media recently about how the U.S. is missing the point by pushing for AGI, while China is focusing solely on applications,\u201d said Helen Toner, interim executive director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cThis is wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome Chinese researchers and some parts of the Chinese government have been interested in AGI and superintelligence for a long time,\u201d Toner said, though she noted this view was primarily held by smaller startups like DeepSeek.",
      "Afra Wang, a researcher focusing on China\u2019s tech scene, said Alibaba\u2019s invocation of AGI and ASI was remarkable.",
      "\u201cThis ASI narrative is definitely something new, especially among the biggest tech companies in China,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Alibaba\u2019s \u201croadmap to artificial superintelligence\u201d seems to scramble mainstream perceptions. Any number of California techno-optimists, like Anthropic\u2019s Dario Amodei or xAI\u2019s Elon Musk, might have delivered Wu\u2019s speech, selling a technology-enabled utopia while largely sidestepping darker questions about how humanity would co-exist with or survive an era of digital superintelligence.",
      "The concept of superintelligence has long been on the minds of \u2014 if not explicitly guiding \u2014 prominent American AI companies. For example, OpenAI released an article focused on the safe development of superintelligent AI models in May 2023. \u201cNow is a good time to start thinking about the governance of superintelligence \u2014 future AI systems dramatically more capable than even AGI,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The possibility of superintelligence is now even being acknowledged in Congress. On Monday, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., announced a draft bill that would, among other actions, \u201cassist Congress in determining the potential for controlled AI systems to reach artificial superintelligence.\u201d",
      "To some, ASI might seem like an outlandish concept when today\u2019s AI systems fail to understand basic tennis rules, hallucinate or fabricate basic information, or do not seem to actually comprehend how the external world functions.",
      "At the same time, AI systems continue to approach and sometimes surpass human capabilities in many domains, from driving cars safely to winning international coding competitions, leaving many experts to say it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, humans develop digital superintelligence.",
      "As the idea of superintelligence gradually enters mainstream debates, many American politicians have announced that the U.S. is in an AI race with China. The White House\u2019s current AI manifesto is titled \u201cWinning the AI Race: America\u2019s AI Action Plan,\u201d while Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, proclaimed that \u201cas a matter of economic security, as a matter of national security, America has to beat China in the AI race.\u201d",
      "Yet charges of an AI race are muddied by a lack of an agreed end goal and swirling definitions of AGI. At worst, experts think an unfettered race toward AGI or ASI could lead to widespread catastrophe or even the end of humanity.",
      "But there\u2019s also plenty of skepticism around talk of AGI and ASI and whether it\u2019s primarily for marketing purposes.",
      "Alibaba is one of China\u2019s largest tech companies, known for providing powerful, free AI models \u2014 also called open-source models \u2014 for download. Alibaba\u2019s Qwen model series, a competitor to models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-5 or Anthropic\u2019s Claude, is the most popular open-source AI system in the world.",
      "Wu announced a new series of Qwen models in his speech last week, including a model that combines text, images, video and audio capabilities.",
      "Many observers point out that narratives about a U.S.-China AI race and a resulting sprint to build AI infrastructure serve AI investors by propping up company valuations and increasing their soft power. Alibaba\u2019s stock has soared since Wu\u2019s speech last week, part of a larger $250 billion comeback this year that has made it China\u2019s hottest AI company.",
      "To unlock a powerful, superintelligent future, Wu predicted that large AI models will replace existing operating systems as the link between users, software and computational power. This future network of large AI models will run on cloud computing networks like Alibaba Cloud, he said.",
      "Irene Zhang, a researcher on China\u2019s AI ecosystem and an editor of ChinaTalk, noted the business undertones of Wu\u2019s announcement.",
      "\u201cThis is a vision of AGI and ASI that\u2019s directly based on Alibaba\u2019s business model,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAlibaba Cloud dominates China\u2019s cloud computing market, and its global market share is now bigger than Oracle\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cAlibaba\u2019s commercial strategy and its publicly stated views on ASI/AGI are symbiotic.\u201d",
      "Matt Sheehan, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, agreed.",
      "\u201cASI is the ultimate frontier, as far as the discourse goes on AI,\u201d Sheehan said. \u201cIt\u2019s notable that Alibaba set this grandiose goal, but in reality, they\u2019re selling cloud services.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Oct. 5, 2025, 4:55 p.m ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the state represented by Sen. Richard Blumenthal. He represents Connecticut, not Illinois."

      "TOKYO \u2014 Japan\u2019s governing party elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader on Saturday, setting her up to become the U.S. ally\u2019s first female prime minister.",
      "Takaichi defeated Shinjiro Koizumi 185 to 156 in a second-round runoff vote to become leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II.",
      "The leadership race was triggered last month when Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would step down after a year in office. Though Takaichi is likely to succeed him as prime minister of Japan, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes later this month, it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "\u201cRight now, rather than feeling happy, I truly believe this is where the real challenge begins,\u201d Takaichi said in her victory speech. \u201cThere is a mountain of work we must all tackle together.\u201d",
      "She also said it was important to make the LDP, which has been tarnished by corruption scandals, \u201ca more spirited and vibrant party, a party that transforms people\u2019s anxieties into hope.\u201d",
      "Takaichi, 64, a hard-line conservative who says her hero is former British leader Margaret Thatcher, was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader.",
      "Though many party members welcome Takaichi\u2019s ascendance as a potential return to the days of Abe, there are concerns that her nationalistic historical views could cause friction with East Asian neighbors China and South Korea.",
      "\u201cBeijing is likely to object to Takaichi\u2019s positions on revising Japan\u2019s postwar pacifist constitution, strengthening maritime security, and bolstering support for Taiwan,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "One of the top priorities for Japan\u2019s next prime minister will be implementing the trade deal reached with the Trump administration in July. The agreement, which imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods including its crucial auto exports, has yet to be put in writing and many of the details remain unclear.",
      "Takaichi has raised the possibility of reopening talks on the deal, which includes a pledge by Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S.",
      "She told reporters after her victory on Saturday that she did not intend to \u201coverturn\u201d anything that Japan and the United States had agreed upon.",
      "\u201cI will firmly adhere to the agreement reached between our two countries,\u201d Takaichi said. \u201cThis applies to tariffs and also investments as well.\u201d",
      "The LDP voted on five leadership candidates in the first round, with Takaichi securing 183 votes to Koizumi\u2019s 164. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, the top spokesperson for the current Japanese government, came in third with 134 votes after a recent surge in polls.",
      "Votes in the first round were divided evenly between 294 LDP lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members who were represented by 295 votes. Lawmakers favored the more moderate Koizumi, while party members preferred Takaichi, who has a passionate base.",
      "In the second round, lawmakers had the same number of votes while rank-and-file party members had 47, representing the 47 prefectures of Japan.",
      "Lawmakers in the second round voted 149 to 145 in favor of Takaichi, while party members gave her 36 votes compared with Koizumi\u2019s 11.",
      "Koizumi, 44, the current agriculture minister and the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, would have been Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",

    "summary": "The terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, has stoked fears among Britain's Jewish community amid a rise in antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"
