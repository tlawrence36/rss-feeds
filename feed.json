      "John Oliver has brought his quirky humor to minor league baseball with the debut of the Erie Moon Mammoths",
      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "The fact that this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \"Last Week Tonight\" team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun. I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d Moon said. \u201cFrom all those years ago to today, I would never have thought anything like this would\u2019ve been possible. The newspaper did something on its 30th anniversary (in 2021). Other than that, I haven't heard much.\u201d",
      "Coleman said since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and also led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Renowned conductor Roger Norrington, known for his historically informed performances, has died at 91",
      "Roger Norrington, a conductor acclaimed for historically informed performances during more than a half-century leading orchestras in Europe and the United States, has died. He was 91.",
      "Norrington died Friday at his home, his son Tom said Saturday. Norrington lived outside Exeter, England.",
      "Norrington conducted both period-instruments and modern orchestras, asking both types to play without vibrato and usually at faster tempi than modern practice.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary dramatist. He made things happen emotionally,\u201d Myron Lutzke, an Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s cellist who helped persuade Norrington to become music director, said Saturday. \u201cHe had his detractors, certainly, and some of them were some of my best friends. But for me, he got the music off the page. He made the concert experience transformative.\u201d",
      "Born on March 16, 1934, Norrington was the son of Arthur, president of Trinity College, Oxford, and the former Edith Carver. A violinist and boy soprano in his youth, Roger attended The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Westminster School, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under conductor Adrian Boult.",
      "In 1962, Norrington founded the Sch\u00fctz Choir, originally dedicated to the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. He became music director of Kent Opera from 1969-84, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta from 1985-89 and New York's Orchestra of St. Luke's from 1990-94.",
      "He was principal conductor of Camerata Salzburg from 1997 to 2006, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2011 and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra from 2011-16.",
      "\u201cOrchestras didn\u2019t generally use vibrato until the 1930s,\u201d Norrington told The Guardian in 2007. \u201cIt is a fashion, like smoking, which came in at about the same time. Smoking is now going, so maybe vibrato will too. ... I have discovered, all the way from Monteverdi to Mahler, is that when music is played as it should be, the sound is wonderful, the expression is wonderful and the instruments match together.\u201d",
      "Norrington was nominated for four Grammy Awards and won in 2001 for a recording of Nicholas Maw's Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonic. Norrington retired after conducting the Royal Northern Sinfonia in an all-Hadyn concert on Nov. 18, 2021.",
      "\u201cI have enjoyed every minute of over 50 years of making music with some of the most wonderful and talented musicians in the world,\" he said in a statement. \u201cThe time has come to step off the podium.\u201d",
      "His first marriage, to Susan McLean May, ended in a divorce in 1982. He married the choreographer Kay Lawrence in the mid-1980s; she died last year.",
      "Norrington was made a Knight Bachelor in 1997.",
      "He is survived by Tom and two children from his first marriage, Ben and Amy.",

      "Coldplay's concert at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday took an unexpected turn when a couple caught on the jumbotron sparked debate online",
      "LONDON -- It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \u201cJumbotron Song,\u201d when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.",
      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity.",
      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",
      "The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: \u201cWhen you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.\u201d",
      "In the internet age, such videos \u2014 or ones taken on someone's smartphone \u2014 can quickly zip around the world.",
      "This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera.",
      "Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that the CEO's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \"We are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",

      "The five-member K-pop group 1VERSE is debuting Friday, with two North Korean defectors alongside members from the United States and Japan",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- With two out of five of its members North Korean defectors, the K-pop group 1VERSE is breaking new ground as it debuts its single album Friday.",
      "The band represents an unusual convergence of backgrounds: North Korea-born rapper Hyuk and singer Seok join Nathan from Arkansas, Kenny from Los Angeles, and Aito from Japan.",
      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",
      "\u201cWith members from different countries all coming together as 1VERSE, I just thought \u2018we can do this regardless of background\u2019 going forward,\u201d said Aito, the group\u2019s youngest member from Chiba, Japan.",
      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",
      "Seok\u2019s path was similarly unconventional. A former soccer player who started playing at 8 years old in North Korea, he defected in 2019. He declined to provide additional details, citing safety concerns.",
      "After arriving in South Korea, he briefly played for a semi-professional team before pursuing physical education studies. During weekend soccer games he was approached about an idol training program.",
      "\u201cI was starting music for the first time, right? So I started with the mindset that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can just stop and try something else,\u201d Seok said.",
      "Both members\u2019 experiences reflect harsh realities they left behind. Hyuk described spending eight to 10 hours daily collecting firewood as a child just to survive.",
      "\u201cWhere I lived, we had to collect firewood just to cook rice and survive day by day \u2014 it was essential,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Hyuk didn't have much access to music growing up. \u201cSince I lived struggling every day, I lived so busily that I wonder if I even had time to listen to music \u2014 I didn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d he said.",
      "Seok had some exposure to K-pop in North Korea, listening occasionally to f(x)\u2018s \u201cLA chA TA\u201d and Super Junior songs despite it being illegal in North Korea to listen to South Korean music. \u201cI probably heard K-pop back in elementary school. But I couldn\u2019t listen often since it was illegal,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts and defectors say K-pop and other South Korean pop culture products have emerged as a challenge to North Korea\u2019s leadership as they steadily gained popularity among the public.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified campaigns since the pandemic to eliminate South Korean cultural influence.",
      "Nathan, from Arkansas, first encountered K-pop through his Texas-based cousins who were longtime fans. \u201cI would kind of just pretend to be a hater, like urgh, K-pop. And then I just so happened to come across EXO\u2019s \u2018Growl\u2019 music video on YouTube,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The group\u2019s diverse backgrounds are reflected in their training, which includes courses on global citizenship. \u201cWe want to be inclusive of everyone\u2019s history, everyone\u2019s current situations back home,\u201d Kenny explained.",
      "Seok expressed excitement about connecting with international fans, particularly in America. \u201cSince I came from North Korea, it\u2019s hard to see foreigners there. So I really wanted to see people from other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The group has already gained traction online. Seok described filming emotional video diaries during difficult early training days, which fans responded to with supportive messages.",
      "\u201cI filmed that diary video with somewhat emotional, slightly teary feelings. And I uploaded it to TikTok or YouTube, and fans sent me comforting letters,\" he said. \u201cAs soon as I saw the first line, tears came out and I was really touched.\u201d",
      "Hyuk acknowledged the attention their North Korean background generates while emphasizing the group\u2019s collective identity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that people are paying attention to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay as long as it doesn\u2019t lean too much to one side ... it\u2019s not just me but all our members are here too, it\u2019s a journey we\u2019re creating together.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe bullwhip is the iconic symbol of an iconic character of cinema history, Indiana Jones, and has been a highlight of this auction,\" Joe Maddalena, Heritage\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The $525,000 price includes the \u201cbuyers premium\u201d attached to all auction items for the house that sells it.",
      "Heritage said the nearly $15 million bid for the Rosebud sled puts it second only to the $32.5 million that Judy Garland's ruby slippers from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d fetched in December. Neither of those buyers were identified either.",

      "Long thought lost, the sled is one of three of the prop known to have survived. Dante stumbled on it when he was filming on the former RKO Pictures lot in 1984. He wasn\u2019t a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",
      "Dante's friend and mentor Steven Spielberg paid $60,500 for another of the sleds in 1982, and anonymous buyer paid $233,000 for the third in 1996.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",
      "The affair transcends violins and piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media.",
      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",
      "Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station\u2019s general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a \u201cdevastating gut punch.\u201d He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT\u2019s budget. Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",
      "The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.",
      "\u201cWe have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. \u201dAt least for the next year we\u2019ll be fine but we\u2019re probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.\u201d",
      "Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning.",
      "\u201cThey broadcast everything, and they make sure that everybody knows and everybody\u2019s safe,\u201d said Whittern, a bartender. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon \u2014 known to local fishermen simply as \u201cthe Rat\u201d \u2014 on Thursday morning.",

      "Bands behaving badly? It's only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans \u201cto know the truth\u201d \u2014 that laryngitis prevented him from performing.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit was dropped.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London\u2019s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",
      "Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was \u201cone of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.\u201d The video garnered over 15 million views.",
      "\u201cThere are no words to express this monumental loss,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cI will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.\u201d",
      "Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family \u201chave felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.\u201d",
      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took \u201ccomfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.\u201d",
      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",
      "As for her reaction to having a \u201cviral hit\u201d? She continued: \u201cClearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What\u2019s that?' Thank you everyone!\u201d",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda is using the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of *Hamilton* to support nonprofits providing immigration services",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to use the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of his award-winning cultural phenomenon \u201cHamilton\u201d as a fundraiser for a coalition of nonprofits providing immigration services.",
      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",
      "Miranda did exclusively reveal some plans for the special, invite-only \u201cHamilton\u201d anniversary show and the preshow reception that he will host. Fans already know the possibilities after the special \u201cHamilton\u201d medley at the Tonys in June. Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign. His administration has encouraged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport people quickly, even to countries where they have never been, in order to rein in illegal immigration.",
      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",
      "Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said the donations would help her group continue to provide community legal services to individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like its challenge to the Trump executive order seeking to strip away birthright citizenship from some children born in the United States.",
      "\u201cAt this time, when so many people are afraid to speak out and support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing to use the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 platform just shows real leadership and bravery,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that more donors will step up and support our sector. We are the firewall between authoritarianism and democracy.\u201d",
      "Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said her nonprofit plans to use the donations from the coalition to support its Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants of their rights and uses the law as \u201ca bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Matos sees it as a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment to use funding generated by \u201cthe story of one of our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers who himself was an indigent immigrant, who through his own grit, determination and his brilliance, worked his way up.\u201d \u201cHe was somebody who thought deeply about this new nation\u2019s democracy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat better way to honor Hamilton and to express our gratitude for these resources?\u201d",
      "For Lin-Manuel Miranda, the fact that people remain fascinated by \u201cHamilton\u201d 10 years later also leaves him feeling grateful.",
      "And he remains surprised by the resonance of the line \u201cImmigrants: We get the job done,\u201d a line shared in the show by Hamilton and French military officer Marquis de Lafayette at the Battle of Yorktown.",
      "\u201cI thought it was no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the moment it was performed on stage, the audience reaction was so joyous at just the utterance of that simple fact. It\u2019s one of the things that just heartens me and gives me hope. In these dark times, it still gets a big cheer.\u201d",
      "The cheering still requires the show to add extra measures of music to wait for the audience to calm down before continuing with the song \u201cYorktown.\u201d Miranda attributes it to the fact that so many Americans are only one or two generations away from an immigrant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction have filed dueling lawsuits after an onstage scuffle last year prompted the cancellation of the band's tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell's onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, prompting the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "Justin Timberlake had \u201cTrolls.\u201d Rihanna has \u201cSmurfs.\u201d Now, we patiently await a \u201cGummi Bears\u201d with the Biebs.",
      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",
      "That line deserves a big laugh from a so-called \u201clegacy sequel\u201d that blends old and new to resurrect a franchise long dormant but isn\u2019t sure where it sits in 2025. A wink here, an eye-gouging there.",
      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Romance novels have always spiced up quiet nights. Now, a genre that has sometimes been dismissed as a guilty pleasure is bringing readers and writers together through social media, book clubs and a growing number of romance-specific bookstores.",
      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re educated on the genre in a real way,\u201d Dahlia said. \u201cMany of them started reading romance \u2014 Danielle Steel, V.C. Andrews, Jude Deveraux \u2014 as teenagers.\u201d",
      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",
      "\"Now they\u2019re loving seeing how widely accepted romance has become.\u201d",

      "And the genre has evolved. \u201cThe romance genre is more diverse in every way including character identity and plot,\u201d she said.",
      "Lovestruck's owner, Rachel Kanter, called the boom \u201cincredible \u2014 and honestly, overdue. Romance has always been one of the most commercially successful genres, but for a long time it didn\u2019t get the respect or space it deserved in the literary world.\u201d",
      "Romance-specific bookstores, she says, \"are places where readers can feel joy, comfort, and connection \u2014 and where love is taken seriously as a literary theme.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets. But a common theme is their \u201cinherently hopeful storylines,\u201d says Elizabeth Michaelson Monaghan, a 52-year-old freelance writer and editor in New York who said she\u2019s read \u201chundreds\u201d of romance novels.",
      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing culture of (mostly) women reading and sharing these books across generations.",

      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",

      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",
      "Cuts in all three states were backed by Democratic governors who once championed expanding health coverage to immigrants.",
      "The Trump administration this week shared the home addresses, ethnicities and personal data of all Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, have sued.",
      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer.",
      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",
      "CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, \u201cbut truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Some people are going to go untreated,\u201d Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer of CommuniCARE+OLE clinics in California, said of the state's Medicaid changes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state\u2019s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals.",
      "Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, said the state's program was not sustainable.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about trying to be non-compassionate or not caring about people,\" she said. \"When we looked at the state budget, the dollars were not there to support what was passed and what was being spent.\u201d",
      "Demuth also noted that children will still have coverage, and adults lacking permanent legal status can buy private health insurance.",
      "Health care providers also are worried that preventable conditions will go unmanaged, and people will avoid care until they end up in emergency rooms \u2013 where care will be available under federal law.",
      "One of those safety-net public hospitals, Cook County Health in Chicago, treated about 8,000 patients from Illinois\u2019 program last year. Dr. Erik Mikaitis, the health system\u2019s CEO, said doing so brought in $111 million in revenue.",
      "But he anticipated other providers who billed through the program could close, he said, adding: \u201cThings can become unstable very quickly.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers said California\u2019s Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues \u2014 a $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",
      "States are also bracing for impact from federal policies. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027.",
      "California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after the first full year of restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with the rollbacks, California provides the most expansive health care coverage for poor adults.",
      "Every new bill requires a shift in Maria's monthly calculations to make ends meet. She believes many people won\u2019t be able to afford the $30-a-month premiums and will instead go back to self-medication or skip treatment altogether.",

Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor\u2019s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions.",
      "Maria has the option to keep her coverage. But she is weighing the health of her family against risking what they\u2019ve built in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d Maria said of her decision to remain on the program. \u201cIf it comes to the point where my husband gets sick and his life is at risk, well then, obviously, we have to choose his life.\u201d",

Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",

      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",

During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m watching children suffer like they\u2019ve never suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no accountability.\u201d",
      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints. More than 200 of the office\u2019s employees remain on leave while that case is decided.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race. Most of the sex discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes out of women\u2019s sports, one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\"OCR will continue to meet its statutory responsibilities while driving to improve efficiency and resolve the longstanding backlog,\u201c Hartman said.",
      "Multiple workers in the office who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said caseloads have grown too big to manage. In last year\u2019s budget request, the office said it was becoming difficult to keep up when investigative staff averaged 42 cases per person. Some estimates put the current caseload beyond 200.",
      "The employees said it means more cases will languish.",
      "Another parent in Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn\u2019t heard from the department since she filed a complaint in May. Her son, Brady, who is blind in one eye and has a learning disability, wasn\u2019t getting the type of help his school promised, including access to teachers\u2019 notes and reduced coursework. Brady, 14, made no academic progress in eighth grade, and he\u2019s now heading to high school without the support he needs, his mother said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been so frustrating not to even have an update at all,\u201d said Clouse, of Ann Arbor. \u201cHe is going to go to high school and fail. I feel like my child will not get a high school diploma if he stays in Ann Arbor Public Schools.\u201d",

      "The removal of 21 children from a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family",
      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",
      "\u201cThe first place typically is the matching program that matches the surrogate with an intended parent. But in this situation the intended parents were the matching program,\u201d Wald said. \u201cI am not familiar with any other prior case where that was true.\u201d",
      "Arcadia police said the six children who were not at the couple's home were found with family friends. The couple's house was \u201cset up for a school environment,\u201d Lt. Kollin Cieadlo said.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were accused of neglect and arrested in May. Charges were not formally pursued at that time in order for an abuse investigation to continue, and detectives now believe there were other instances of abuse, Cieadlo said.",
      "A 2-month-old infant with a traumatic head injury, allegedly at the hands of a nanny, remains in a hospital in stable condition, he said.",
      "California law requires child welfare agencies to prioritize placing children who cannot safely be with their parents in homes with extended family, and requires siblings to be kept together unless it would endanger the child to do so, said Leslie Heimov, the executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center of California.",
      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",
      "It\u2019s more complicated to find foster homes for larger families that can accommodate all the children\u2019s needs, especially for infants, Heimov said.",
      "In addition to expenses and limited space, it's hard to give infants the proper stimulation and care they need if they are in a home with many other children, she said.",
      "In cases involving many children, the state will sometimes get creative to make sure that siblings can maintain relationships with each other, like placing them in the same neighborhood, or placing them in different but related households, Heimov said.",
      "A case involving over 20 children conceived through surrogacy would \u201cpresent some legal questions,\u201d said Heimov. \u201cBut it would not change our advocacy \u2014 we want every child we represent to be in a loving, safe home.\"",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",

      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Dozens of ice cream makers pledged on Monday to remove artificial dyes from their products by 2028",
      "Ice cream makers representing about 90% of the U.S. supply of the frozen treat have pledged to remove artificial dyes from their products in less than three years, federal health officials said Monday.",
      "The move is the latest voluntary effort by food manufacturers to heed calls from the Trump administration to remove synthetic dyes over concerns about potential health effects. In recent weeks, companies including Nestle, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would pull artificial colors from their foods, too.",
      "\u201cThis is a Renaissance moment for health in America,\" U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference.",
      "About 40 makers of ice cream and frozen dairy desserts said they would remove seven petroleum-based dyes from their products by 2028, according to Michael Dykes, president of the International Dairy Foods Association. The colors are Red 3, Red 40, Green 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6. The trade group wouldn't identify the firms, although Turkey Hill Dairy chief executive Andy Jacobs joined the gathering.",
      "The national focus on artificial food dyes is \u201ca good step to take,\" but officials should not ignore larger known contributors to chronic disease, including the added sugars and saturated fat commonly found in ice cream, said Deanna Hoelscher, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\u201cJust taking out or changing the food dye source is not necessarily going to make it a healthy option,\u201d she said. \u201cIt still is a food that should be consumed in moderation.\u201d",
      "However, Makary also hinted that new federal dietary guidelines, expected later this year, would challenge established links between saturated fat and heart disease, ending what he called \u201ca 70-year demonization of natural saturated fat.\u201d",
      "The average American eats about 4 gallons of ice cream a year, the IDFA said.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies showing that they may cause some neurobehavioral problems, such as hyperactivity and attention problems, in some children. The Food and Drug Administration has maintained that approved dyes are safe and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects\u201d when consuming foods made with them.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has criticized the dyes and pressured manufacturers to remove them from foods. In their place, manufacturers should use dyes made from fruit juices, plant extracts and other sources, federal officials said.",
      "The FDA has approved new natural color additives in recent months, including a new blue color made from the fruit of the gardenia announced Monday. Gardenia (genipin) blue is approved for use in sports drinks, candies and certain other products, the agency said.",
      "Makary also sent a letter to food manufacturers on Monday that \u201cencourages\u201d them to speed up removal of the dye known as Red 3, which was banned in January. Food makers have until 2027 to remove the dye, which was found to cause cancer in laboratory rats, but not humans.",
      "Some food companies have said they will stop using artificial dyes, but relying on voluntary action rather than regulatory requirements won't guarantee compliance, said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "\u201cTalk is cheap,\u201d Galligan said. \u201cIt's easy for companies to make promises to look like they're being compliant and generate goodwill among consumers and the Trump administration, but it remains to be seen if they will actually follow through.\u201d",

      "In one of the top Arctic birding destinations in the world, environmental and health challenges are threatening some of the seabirds that are part of Norway\u2019s unique coastal ecosystem",
      "VARD\u00d8, Norway -- In one of the top Arctic birding destinations in the world, environmental and health challenges are threatening some of the seabirds that are part of Norway's unique coastal ecosystem.",
      "The population of kittiwakes has decreased by 80% since the 1990s along the Scandinavian country's coast. The small seagull species, among others, is under siege from climate change, predation, local fisheries and the bird flu.",
      "So the town of Vard\u00f8, on the remote Vard\u00f8ya Island in the Barents Sea, has stepped up to help the migrating visitors.",
      "Three years ago, local fisherman Jan Vidar Hansen built a \u201cseagull hotel\u201d out of crates for kittiwakes and other seabirds to nest in safely. The hotel has the added bonus of limiting the spread of unwelcome smells, dirty nests and droppings that have become a nuisance for the island's human population.",
      "\u201cThe first year there was 55 nests. Last year it was 74, and this year we have 76,\u201d Vidar Hansen said. He hopes the local council will agree to build a bigger seagull hotel in the future.",
      "Seabirds have long been an important part of the identity of Vard\u00f8 \u2014 so much so that the local museum has an exhibition dedicated to them. The town is known for its birding tourism as much as its radar station, which provides critical data to the U.S. Strategic Command thanks to its location nearly 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Russia\u2019s military hub on the Kola Peninsula.",
      "Norway's northern coast is an ecologically diverse area due to its topography as well as the Gulf Stream, which brings warmer water up from the Gulf of Mexico and then mixes with the cold Arctic air and water. This warmer water keeps the Barents Sea free from ice even though it's north of the Arctic Circle, and brings tons of fish larvae and other biomass up the Norwegian coast.",
      "But the Gulf Stream is affected by climate change and is now bringing water that is too warm into the Barents Sea, changing the rich composition of the species there. It affects congregations of seabirds, marine mammals and, of course, many fish species.",
      "Fish that need colder water are being pushed further north, while others that require the mix of warmer and Arctic water \u2014 like the small schooling fish called capelin \u2014 are seeing their migration patterns disturbed.",
      "Capelin, for instance, are a major part of the diet for surface-feeding seabirds like kittiwakes, according to Tone Kristin Reiertsen, a researcher with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.",
      "When capelin either swim deeper into the sea to get to colder water, or migrate further north, seabirds cannot get to them, she said. That in turn impacts the success of seabirds' breeding because they depend on capelin to bring to their chicks.",
      "Boris Belchev, a bird guide and ranger on the nearby Horn\u00f8ya Island, says it's a frightening domino effect.",
      "\"I was seeing birds that usually eat fish on the tundra start eating berries because they don\u2019t have their normal food,\u201d he said.",
      "With fewer seabirds surviving, those who remain are easy targets for predators like white-tailed eagles, Reiertsen said. Plus, fisheries situated close to the coastal cliff nesting sites can disturb the dynamics of the colonies.",
      "And then there's the threat of bird flu. In 2023, a large outbreak killed some 25,000 kittiwakes alone along the northern Norwegian coast, Reiertsen said.",
      "\u201cIt felt like an apocalypse,\" she said.",
      "Vidar Hansen's seagull hotel in Vard\u00f8 is one of seven such kittiwake hotels along the Norwegian coast, Reiertsen said.",
      "\u201cIt's not an easy task to get the kittiwakes to move in to these hotels,\u201d she said with a laugh.",
      "But it's working. The small seagulls in recent years have migrated deeper into Vard\u00f8's center in search of protection from predators. There were roughly 300 kittiwakes nesting in various buildings in the town and now the population there is roughly 1,300, she added.",
      "Before the Vard\u00f8 hotel, there were \"many empty nests around the whole city,\u201d Vidar Hansen said.",
      "Reiertsen said kittiwakes and other seabirds are crucial to the region's ecology. Their droppings bring important nutrients into the sea, and further decreases in their population could be dangerous to the entire ecosystem.",
      "She said officials need to change their mindset from monitoring the problem to figuring out how to fix it. A potential idea, she added, could be limiting or prohibiting fisheries and boat traffic near nesting colonies.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to act quickly.\u201d",
      "The seabirds are also key to Vard\u00f8's economy.",
      "Just a short boat ride away from Vard\u00f8 lies Horn\u00f8ya Island, a birdwatchers' paradise. Thousands of visitors flock to the uninhabited Horn\u00f8ya, which is home to some 100,000 seabirds nesting there during breeding season, including much-loved Atlantic puffins, common guillemots and razorbills.",
      "But the island's seabird population has also declined dramatically in recent years. There haven't been any recorded common guillemot chicks there since 2018, Belchev said.",
      "\u201cLast summer, I was shocked. \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Where are all the birds?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "If Norway's government closes the island to the public, or birds stop nesting there and the birdwatchers stop coming, it could have a huge impact on Vard\u00f8ya Island.",
      "\u201cEvery small business in the town, it\u2019s depending on the tourists to come and visit the island and stay in the town and shop and use the gas station and use the small restaurants,\u201d Belchev said. __",

      "The prosecution accuses Bolsonaro of leading an armed criminal organization, attempting to stage a coup and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, aggravated damage, and deterioration of listed heritage sites.",
      "A federal police investigation placed Bolsonaro at the top of a criminal organization that had been active since at least 2021. Police say that after Bolsonaro\u2019s loss to Lula, the organization conspired to overturn the election result.",
      "Part of that plot included a plan to kill Lula and a Supreme Court justice, the prosecution alleges. It also says that the Jan. 8 riot when Bolsonaro supporters ransacked top government buildings a week after Lula took office was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet says Bolsonaro\u2019s actions \u201cwere not limited to a passive stance of resistance to defeat, but were a conscious effort to create an environment conducive to violence and a coup.\u201d",
      "In the court order unsealed Friday, Justice Alexandre de Moraes said Bolsonaro and his son may also have committed the crimes of coercion during a legal proceeding, obstruction of an investigation involving a criminal organization and attack on Brazil\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied the allegations and asserted that he\u2019s the target of political persecution. He has echoed Trump and called the trial a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "The far-right former leader has now been barred from using social media, but on Thursday, he said on X that \u201cthose who challenge the system are being punished, silenced, and isolated.\u201d",
      "Regarding the restrictive measures carried out on Friday, Bolsonaro called them a \u201csupreme humiliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI never thought about leaving Brazil, I never thought about going to an embassy, but the precautionary measures are because of that,\u201d he told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "After the prosecution called for a guilty verdict in its final allegations issued Tuesday, the defense will soon present its case, likely in the coming weeks.",
      "The panel of Supreme Court justices that opened the trial against Bolsonaro will vote on whether to convict or acquit him. Experts say a decision is expected before the end of the year.",
      "A guilty verdict on the coup plot charge carries a sentence of up to 12 years, which could, along with guilty verdicts on other charges, bring decades behind bars.",
      "But Antonio Jose\u0301 Teixeira Martins, a law professor at Rio de Janeiro State University, said Bolsonaro could be detained even before there's a verdict.",
      "\u201cWhether this happens or not depends on how events unfold from now on, that is if these new measures prove sufficient to guarantee public order, the application of criminal law and prevent the risk of escape,\u201d Teixeira Martins said.",
      "Brazil\u2019s top electoral court has already banned Bolsonaro from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.",

      "Japanese voters are casting ballots in a key parliamentary election",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese were voting Sunday for seats in the smaller of Japan's two parliamentary houses in a key election with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and his ruling coalition facing a possible defeat that could worsen the country's political instability.",
      "Voters were deciding half of the 248 seats in the upper house, the less powerful of the two chambers in Japan's Diet. Early results were expected Sunday night.",
      "Ishiba has set the bar low, wanting a simple majority of 125 seats, which means his Liberal Democratic Party and its Buddhist-backed junior coalition partner Komeito need to win 50 to add to the 75 seats they already have.",
      "That is a big retreat from the 141 seats they had pre-election, but media surveys predict big setbacks for Ishiba.",
      "A poor performance on Sunday would not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file no-confidence against a leader, but it would certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan\u2019s political stability. Ishiba would face calls from within the LDP party to step down or find another coalition partner.",
      "Soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top issues for frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have also emerged as a key issue, with a surging right-wing populist party leading the campaign.",
      "Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations, and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba.",
      "Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.",
      "Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties. The eight main opposition groups, however, are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "The emerging populist party Sanseito stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. The party\u2019s populist platform also includes anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.",
      "Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats\u2019 expense.",
      "The spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media has triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.",
      "The LDP has almost continuously dominated Japan's postwar politics, contributing to its political stability and social conformity.",

      "Fifty years after her death, Baker now gazes out over a diverse neighborhood of northeast Paris, thanks to urban artist FKDL and a street art festival aimed at promoting community spirit.",
      "Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Baker became a megastar in the 1930s, especially in France, where she moved in 1925 as she sought to flee racism and segregation in the United States.",
      "In addition to her stage fame, Baker also spied on the Nazis for the French Resistance and marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington. She died in Paris in 1975.",
      "\u2018\u2019I feel moved and I feel happy, because this is part of a memory of my mother,\u201d her son Brian Baker told the Associated Press at the unveiling of the mural Saturday. He was one of 12 children Josephine Baker adopted from around the world that she called her \u2033rainbow tribe\u2033 and what her son called \u2019\u2019a little United Nations.\u2033",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Hundreds of thousands of supporters of Bangladesh\u2019s largest Islamist party rallied in the capital on Saturday to show their strength ahead of elections expected next year, as the South Asian nation stands a t a crossroads after the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.",
      "An interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus said the next election would be held in April but his administration did not rule out a possibility of polls in February as strongly demanded by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies.",
      "Jamaat-e-Islami, which had sided with Pakistan during Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971, said earlier it would mobilize 1 million people on Saturday.",
      "While Hasina was in power from 2009 until she was toppled in student-led protests last year and fled to India, top leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami were either executed or jailed on charges of crimes against humanity and other serious crimes in 1971. In late march in 1971 Pakistan\u2019s military had launched a violent crackdown on the city of Dhaka, then part of East Pakistan, to quell a rising nationalist movement seeking independence for what is today known as Bangladesh.",
      "The party on Saturday placed a seven-point demand to the Yunus-led administration to ensure a free, fair and peaceful election, the trial of all mass killings, essential reforms and proclamation and implementation of a charter involving last year\u2019s mass uprising. It also wants the introduction of a proportional representation system in the election.",
      "Thousands of supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami had spent the night on the Dhaka University campus before the rally. On Saturday morning, they continued to stream toward the Suhrawardy Udyan, a historical ground where the Pakistani army had surrendered to a joint force of India and Bangladesh on Dec. 16 in 1971, ending the nine-month war.",
      "It was the first time the party was allowed to hold a rally on this ground since 1971. To many, the decision signaled a shift supported by Yunus' government in which Islamists are gaining momentum with further fragmentation of Bangladesh\u2019s politics and shrinking of liberal forces.",
      "Hasina, whose father was the independence leader and the country\u2019s first president, is a fierce political rival of Jamaat-e-Islami. The party is expected to contest 300 parliamentary seats and is attempting to forge alliances with other Islamist groups and parties in hopes of becoming a third force in the country behind the BNP, headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, and Hasina\u2019s former ruling Awami League party.",
      "The party has a close connection with a new political party formed by students who led the anti-Hasina uprising. Both Jamaat-e-Islami and the students' National Citizen Party also promote anti-India campaign.",
      "The Yunus-led administration has banned the Awami League and Hasina has been in exile in India since Aug. 5. She is facing charges of crimes against humanity. The United Nations said in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the anti-Hasina uprising in July-August last year.",

      "This comes as government forces, initially deployed to restore order but effectively sided with the Bedouins against the Druze, were redeployed to halt renewed fighting that erupted late Thursday. The violence has also drawn airstrikes against Syrian forces by neighboring Israel before a truce was reached.",

      "Addressing the Bedouins, al-Sharaa said they \u201ccannot replace the role of the state in handling the country\u2019s affairs and restoring security.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe thank the Bedouins for their heroic stances but demand they fully commit to the ceasefire and comply with the state\u2019s orders.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a prominent Druze leader, Sheikh Hikmat Al-Hijri, who opposes the current government and has distanced himself from the two ceasefires announced on Tuesday and Wednesday, said an agreement, brokered under the sponsorship of guarantor states, has several measures aimed at de-escalating tensions in Suweida.",
      "This includes the deployment of General Security checkpoints outside the province\u2019s administrative borders to contain clashes and prevent infiltration, a 48-hour ban on entry by any party into border villages, and safe, guaranteed passage for remaining members of the Bedouin tribes still inside the province.",
      "Sharaa reiterated that Suweida \u201cremains an integral part of the Syrian state, and the Druze constitute a fundamental pillar of the Syrian national fabric,\" vowing to protect all minorities in Syria.",
      "He also thanked the United States for its \u201csignificant role in affirming its support for Syria during these difficult times,\u201d as well as Arab countries and Turkey, who mediated Wednesday's truce.",
      "More than half of the roughly 1 million Druze worldwide live in Syria. Most of the other Druze live in Lebanon and Israel, including in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and annexed in 1981.",

      "Russia launched a massive overnight drone and missile attack on Ukraine.",
      "Russia launched a massive attack on Ukraine overnight into Saturday with hundreds of drones, killing at least one person, part of a stepped-up bombing campaign that has dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the more than 3-year-old war.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted on X that Russia fired over 300 drones, along with more than 30 cruise missiles.",
      "One person died in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, which was hit with more than 20 drones and a missile, Mayor Hennadii Trukhanov wrote on Telegram, while five people were rescued when a fire broke out in a residential high-rise building.",
      "According to Zelenskyy, six other people were wounded in the attack on Odesa, including a child, and critical infrastructure was damaged in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Sumy region.",
      "The Ukrainian president also thanked international leaders \u201cwho understand how important it is to promptly implement our agreements\u201d aimed at boosting Ukraine\u2019s defense capabilities, including joint weapons production, drone manufacturing and the supply of air defense systems.",
      "Russia has been intensifying its long-range attacks on Ukrainian cities. It now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones \u2014 a record.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said it shot down 71 Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that 13 drones were shot down as they approached the Russian capital.",
      "In other developments, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister accused Russia on Saturday of deporting Ukrainian citizens into Georgia and leaving them stranded without proper identification.",
      "Andrii Sybiha said Moscow has escalated the practice of expelling Ukrainians \u2014 many of whom are former prisoners \u2014 across its southern border with Georgia, instead of returning them directly to Ukraine.",
      "\u201cDozens of people, many of whom lack proper documentation, have been stuck in the transit zone,\u201d he wrote on X. There was no immediate response from Moscow.",

      "South Korea\u2019s former President Yoon Suk Yeol faces new criminal charges tied to his controversial martial law declaration",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol was indicted Saturday on additional criminal charges related to his ill-fated imposition of martial law, about three months after he was formally thrown out of office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s additional indictments mean he will remain in jail for up to six months as he faces a trial at the Seoul Central District Court on his Dec. 3 martial law declaration that plunged South Korea into huge political turmoil. Yoon was sent back to prison last week after the Seoul court approved his arrest warrant requested by a team of investigators headed by independent counsel Cho Eun-suk.",
      "Cho\u2019s team indicted Yoon on abuse of power that obstructed the rights of some of his Cabinet members. The charge was imposed because Yoon summoned only select Cabinet members to approve his emergency martial law when South Korean law requires approval of all Cabinet members for such a measure, Park Ji-young, a senior investigator at Cho\u2019s team, told a briefing.",
      "Park said Yoon was also charged with fabricating an official document in an attempt to satisfy a formal requirement for a martial law declaration before he eventually destroyed it.",
      "After declaring martial law, Yoon sent troops and police officers to the opposition-controlled National Assembly, but enough lawmakers managed to enter an assembly chamber and voted down his decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it. Yoon was later impeached by the assembly, with some of his ruling party lawmakers voting to suspend his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon has argued his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \u201cwickedness\u201d of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government\u2019s budget bill. He earlier called the National Assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d and \u201canti-state forces.\u201d",
      "In January, state prosecutors arrested and indicted him on rebellion, a grave charge that would incur the death penalty or life imprisonment if convicted.",
      "In March, however, Yoon was released from prison after a judge at the Seoul district court canceled his arrest to allow him to stand trial without being held in custody.",
      "In April, the Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon as president, prompting a snap election to choose his successor. After winning that election, new President Lee Jae Myung, a former Democratic Party leader, approved legislation to launch independent investigations to uncover fuller details of Yoon's martial law stunt and delve into other criminal allegations involving his wife and administration. Lee named Cho an independent counsel to lead an investigation on Yoon's martial law decree.",
      "In May, state prosecutors indicted Yoon on charges of abusing power and forcing soldiers and police officers to try to seal the assembly and election offices, acts that are not part of their duties.",

      "The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government made a rare appearance at a ceremony on Saturday honoring General Aung San, an independence hero and father of jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi",
      "BANGKOK -- The head of Myanmar\u2019s military government made a rare appearance at a ceremony on Saturday honoring General Aung San, an independence hero and father of jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi.",
      "It was the first time that 69-year-old Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing attended the Martyrs' Day wreath-laying since the army ousted Suu Kyi and seized power in February 2021. The leader's appearance comes as his embattled government is preparing to hold elections while fighting armed opposition groups across the country.",
      "Martyrs\u2019 Day was an important event in Myanmar\u2019s calendar for decades, but the military has downplayed the holiday in recent years. It commemorates the assassination of Aung San, a former Prime Minister who was gunned down at the age of 32 along with six Cabinet colleagues and two other officials in 1947, just months before the country \u2014 then called Burma \u2014 achieved freedom from British colonial rule. A political rival, former Prime Minister U Saw, was tried and hanged for plotting the attack.",
      "Suu Kyi, who was detained when the army took over in 2021, was absent from the event for a fifth consecutive year. She is currently serving a 27-year prison term on what are widely regarded as contrived charges meant to keep her from political activity. She has not been seen in public since her arrest.",
      "Ye Aung Than, a son of Suu Kyi\u2019s estranged older brother, laid a wreath in front of his grandfather\u2019s tomb during the main ceremony at the Martyrs\u2019 Mausoleum near the foot of the towering Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon.",
      "With Myanmar national flags flying at half-staff, members of the ruling military council, and cabinet, as well as high-ranking military generals joined Min Aung Hlaing in placing a basket of flowers in front of the tombs of the nine martyrs.",
      "As the ceremony was held, people in Yangon paid tribute to independence leaders by blaring car horns and sirens at 10:37 a.m., the time of the 1947 attack.",
      "Democracy supporters also held scattered rallies in parts of the country that are not under military control.",
      "The event comes five months before elections that the military has promised to hold by the end of this year.",
      "The poll is widely seen as an attempt to legitimize the military\u2019s seizure of power through the ballot box and is expected to deliver a result that ensures the generals retain control.",
      "The 2021 military takeover was met with widespread nonviolent protests, but after peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "Since the army took power, 6,974 people including poets, activists, politicians and others have been killed, and 29,405 people have been arrested by the security forces, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, an independent organization that keeps detailed tallies of arrests and casualties linked to the nation\u2019s political conflicts. The military government calls that figure an exaggeration.",
      "The military, which is now estimated to control less than half the country, has been accelerating its counter-offensives to retake areas controlled by opposition groups ahead of the election.",

      "TOKYO -- Decontaminated but slightly radioactive soil from Fukushima was delivered Saturday to the Japanese prime minister's office to be reused in an effort to showcase its safety.",
      "This is the first soil to be used, aside from experiments, since the 2011 nuclear disaster when the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered a cataclysmic meltdown following an earthquake and tsunami that left large amounts of radioactive materials spewing out from the facility, polluting surrounding areas.",
      "The government is desperate to set people's minds at ease about recycling the 14 million cubic meters of decontaminated soil, enough to fill 11 baseball stadiums, collected after massive clean-ups and stored at a sprawling outdoor facility near the Fukushima plant. Officials have pledged to find final disposal sites outside of Fukushima by 2045.",
      "The Environment Ministry said the 2 cubic meters, now at Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's office complex in Tokyo, will be used as foundation material in one section of the lawn garden, based on the ministry\u2019s safety guidelines endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The soil does not include any from inside the plant.",
      "Despite assurances, there has been much public unease. The government has already been forced to scrap a plan to experiment using some of the soil in flower beds at several public parks in and around Tokyo following protests.",

    "story": [
      "Violence between government forces and armed factions of a religious minority in southern Syria this week has deepened divisions in a country still recuperating from a civil war",
      "BEIRUT -- An eruption of violence in Syria this week that entangled government forces, Bedouin tribes, the Druze religious minority and neighboring Israel highlighted just how combustible the country remains seven months after its longtime authoritarian leader was toppled.",
      "The Druze and other minorities increasingly mistrust a central government run by a man once affiliated with al-Qaida, even though he has pledged to protect Syria\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious groups since helping to oust Bashar Assad after a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "This sectarian turbulence within Syria threatens to shake-up postwar alliances and exacerbate regional tensions, experts say. It could also potentially draw the country closer to Turkey and away from Israel, with whom it has been quietly engaging since Assad\u2019s fall, with encouragement from the Trump administration.",
      "Deadly clashes broke out last Sunday in the southern province of Sweida between Druze militias and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes.",
      "Government forces intervened, ostensibly to restore order, but ended up trying to wrest control of Sweida from the Druze factions that control it.",
      "Hundreds were killed in the fighting, and some government fighters allegedly executed Druze civilians and burned and looted their houses.",
      "Driven by concerns about security and domestic politics, Israel intervened on behalf of the Druze, who are seen as a loyal minority within Israel and often serve in its military.",
      "Israeli warplanes bombarded the Syrian Defense Ministry\u2019s headquarters in central Damascus and struck near the presidential palace. It was an apparent warning to the country's interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led Islamist rebels that overthrew Assad but has since preached coexistence and sought ties with with the West. The Israeli army also struck government forces in Sweida.",
      "By Wednesday, a truce had been mediated that allowed Druze factions and clerics to maintain security in Sweida as government forces pulled out \u2014 although fighting persisted between Druze and Bedouin forces. Early Saturday, U.S. envoy to Syria Tom Barrack announced a separate ceasefire had been brokered between Israel and Syria.",
      "This past week\u2019s clashes aren\u2019t the first instance of sectarian violence in Syria since the fall of Assad.",
      "A few months after Assad fled and after a transition that initially was mostly peaceful, government forces and pro-Assad armed groups clashed on Syria's coast. That spurred sectarian attacks that killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite religious minority to which Assad belongs.",
      "Those killings left other minority groups, including the Druze in the south, and the Kurds in the northeast \u2013 who have a de facto autonomous area under their control -- wary that the country\u2019s new leaders would protect them.",
      "Violence is only part of the problem. Syria\u2019s minority groups only have been given what many see as token representation in the interim government, according to Bassam Alahmad, executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice, a civil society organization.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a transitional period. We should have a dialogue, and they (the minorities) should feel that they\u2019re a real part of the state,\u201d Alahmad said. Instead, with the incursion into Sweida, the new authorities have sent a message that they would use military force to \u201ccontrol every part of Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBashar Assad tried this way,\u201d and it failed, he added.",
      "On the other hand, supporters of the new government fear that its decision to back down in Sweida could signal to other minorities that it\u2019s OK to demand their own autonomous regions, which would fragment and weaken the country.",
      "If Damascus cedes security control of Sweida to the Druze, \u201cof course everyone else is going to demand the same thing,\u201d said Abdel Hakim al-Masri, a former official in the Turkish-backed regional government in Syria\u2019s northwest before Assad\u2019s fall.",
      "\u201cThis is what we are afraid of,\u201d he said.",
      "Before this week\u2019s flare-up between Israel and Syria, and despite a long history of suspicion between the two countries, the Trump administration had been pushing their leaders to post-Assad to work toward normalizing relations \u2013 meaning that Syria would formally recognize Israel and establish diplomatic relations, or at least enter into some limited agreement on security matters.",
      "Syrian officials have acknowledged holding indirect talks with Israel, but defusing decades of tension was never going to be easy.",
      "After Assad\u2019s fall, Israeli forces seized control of a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in Syria and carried out airstrikes on military sites in what Israeli officials said was a move to create a demilitarized zone south of Damascus.",
      "Dareen Khalifa, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, said she believes Israel could have gotten the same result through negotiations.",
      "But now it\u2019s unlikely Syria will be willing to continue down the path of reconciliation with Israel, at least in the short term, she said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the Israelis could expect to drop bombs on Damascus and still have some kind of normal dialogue with the Syrians,\u201d said Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, a New York-based organization that focuses on global security challenges. \u201cJust like Netanyahu, al-Sharaa\u2019s got a domestic constituency that he\u2019s got to answer to.\u201d",
      "Yet even after the events of this past week, the Trump administration still seems to have hope of keeping the talks alive. U.S. officials are \u201cengaging diplomatically with Israel and Syria at the highest levels, both to address the present crisis and reach a lasting agreement between two sovereign states,\u201d says Dorothy Shea, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "Shea said during a U.N. Security Council emergency meeting on Thursday that \u201cthe United States did not support recent Israeli strikes.\u201d",
      "During Syria\u2019s civil war, the U.S. was allied with Kurdish forces in the country\u2019s northeast in their fight against the Islamic State militant group.",
      "But since Assad\u2019s fall, the U.S. has begun gradually pulling its forces out of Syria and has encouraged the Kurds to integrate their forces with those of the new authorities in Damascus.",
      "To that end, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces agreed in March to a landmark deal that would merge them with the national army. But implementation has stalled. A major sticking point has been whether the SDF would remain as a cohesive unit in the new army or be dissolved completely.",
      "Khalifa said the conflict in Sweida is \u201cdefinitely going to complicate\u201d those talks.",
      "Not only are the Kurds mistrustful of government forces after their attacks on Alawite and Druze minorities, but now they also view them as looking weak. \u201cLet\u2019s be frank, the government came out of this looking defeated,\u201d Khalifa said.",
      "It\u2019s possible that the Kurds, like the Druze, might look to Israel for support, but Turkey is unlikely to stand by idly if they do, Khalifa said.",
      "The Turkish government considers the SDF a terrorist organization because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey. For that reason, it has long wanted to curtail the group\u2019s influence just across its border.",
      "Israel\u2019s latest military foray in Syria could give its new leaders an incentive to draw closer to Ankara, according to Clarke. That could include pursuing a defense pact that has been discussed but not implemented.",
      "Turkish defense ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity according to procedures, said that if requested, Ankara is ready to assist Syria in strengthening its defense capabilities.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threat against Brazil has sparked political turmoil",
      "SAO PAULO -- U.S. President Donald Trump may have thought that pressuring Brazil with higher tariffs would help his ally, the country's former President Jair Bolsonaro, but the move apparently backfired.",
      "Last week, Trump sent a letter to Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva threatening a 50% import tax and directly linking the decision to Bolsonaro\u2019s trial, which he called a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis trial should end immediately!\u201d Trump wrote Thursday evening in a second letter, this one addressed to Bolsonaro. He added that he had \u201cstrongly voiced\u201d his disapproval through his tariff policy.",
      "Rather than backing down, Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court escalated the case, worsening Bolsonaro\u2019s legal troubles. On Friday morning, federal police raided Bolsonaro\u2019s home and political office. The former president was ordered to wear an ankle monitor, banned from using social media, and hit with other restrictions.",
      "Meanwhile, President Lula \u2014 who was facing higher unpopularity, growing opposition in Congress and increasing risks to his likely reelection bid \u2014 seems to have gained politically from the situation.",
      "Now the 79-year-old leftist Lula, in office for the third non-consecutive term of his long political career, is seeing renewed acceptance, congressional support against Trump and pleas to run one last time to defend Brazil's sovereignty.",
      "Lula has appeared more energized in public since Trump's announcement. At a national students assembly Thursday, he wore a blue cap reading \u201cSovereign Brazil Unites Us\" \u2014 a contrast to MAGA's red cap.",
      "\u201cA gringo will not give orders to this president,\" he told the crowd, and called the tariff hike \u201cunacceptable blackmail.\u201d",
      "The impact on Lula is not a first. Trump's actions targeting other countries have boosted ideological rivals in Canada and Australia instead of strengthening his allies at a local level.",
      "Private pollster Atlas said Tuesday that Lula\u2019s unpopularity had reversed course after his spat with Trump. Lula's job approval went from at 47.3% in June to 49.7% since the tariffs battle began. The poll of more than 2,800 people was conducted July 11-13, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points. The study also said 62.2% of Brazilians think the higher tariffs are unjustified while 36.8% agree with the measure.",
      "Even Bolsonaro\u2019s former vice president, Sen. Hamilton Mour\u00e3o, criticized Trump\u2019s move as undue interference in Brazil\u2019s politics, though he said he agreed the trial against the far-right leader is biased against him.",
      "Social media analytics firm Palver analyzed 20,000 messages about Trump on WhatsApp, Brazil\u2019s most widely used communication platform, a day after Trump's announcement. Its analysis said right-wing users dominated viral content, but spontaneous conversations leaned left, mocking Bolsonaro as submissive and defending Brazil\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTrump has put Lula back in the game,\u201d said Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former spokesman for the Brazilian presidency who only weeks ago argued that Lula had lost his front-runner status in the presidential race as he struggled to deliver on his promises on the economy.",
      "\u201cTrump handed it to Lula on a silver platter,\u201d Traumann said.",
      "Business leaders who until recently sided with Bolsonaro are having to court Lula to negotiate with Trump. Agribusiness, Brazil\u2019s largest economic sector and a traditional right-wing stronghold, united to criticize the U.S. president's move. Industry groups were quick to denounce the tariffs as politically motivated and lacking any commercial justification.",
      "\u201cIn general, with the major exception of a more radical conservative wing, (Trump\u2019s move) generated national outrage for violating Brazil\u2019s sovereignty,\u201d lawmaker Arnaldo Jardim, a member of the congressional agricultural caucus, told The Associated Press.",
      "Jardim, who pushed for the approval of a reciprocity bill that could be used by Lula if there\u2019s no agreement until the Aug. 1 deadline, hardly sides with the president.",
      "\u201cEven among sectors that initially thought this could benefit Bolsonaro, many had to reconsider their positions,\u201d he said.",
      "Top congressional leaders who recently helped nix a Lula decree to raise a transactions tax were moving toward a head-on collision with him. After Trump\u2019s announcement, they signed a joint statement agreeing with Lula's promise to use the reciprocity law against the U.S.",
      "In another change, Brazil\u2019s Congress decided to start moving on Lula\u2019s plan to give an income tax break to millions of poorer Brazilians. Many politicians said that such initiative was dead after Lula became the first president in three decades to have a decree annulled by lawmakers.",
      "At the Supreme Court, Bolsonaro is only getting deeper into trouble as his trial continues.",
      "Earlier this week, Brazil\u2019s chief prosecutor called for a guilty verdict, accusing the former president of leading an armed criminal organization, attempting to stage a coup and attempting violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, among other charges.",
      "The defense will next likely present its case in the coming weeks, after which the panel of Supreme Court justices in the trial will vote on whether to convict or acquit him.",
      "The former president also suffered more consequences \u2014 the court's latest restrictions on Bolsonaro, including the ankle monitor, are part of a second investigation against one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a Brazilian lawmaker who currently lives in the United States and is known for his close ties to Trump. He has been under scrutiny for allegedly working with U.S. authorities to impose sanctions against Brazilian officials.",

      "The court\u2019s decision cited both Trump's letter to Lula and several social media posts by the Bolsonaros in support of sanctions against Brazilian officials and speaking favorably about tariffs.",
      "\u201cA sovereign country like Brazil will always know how to defend its democracy and sovereignty,\u201d de Moraes said. \u201cThe judiciary will not allow any attempt to subject the functioning of the Supreme Court to the scrutiny of another state through hostile acts.\u201d",

      "Artisans in South Sudan are turning discarded tires into affordable footwear as the country faces a severe economic crisis",
      "WAU, South Sudan -- From Rwanda to Kenya, fashioning footwear from discarded tires has long been a mark of local ingenuity.",
      "In South Sudan, however, the creative work of such artisans is now fueled by an economic crisis that has left the government on the verge of bankruptcy and many people struggling to put food on the table.",
      "As South Sudan\u2019s oil revenues have dwindled, the government for months has been unable to pay civil servants on time. The cash crisis affects everyone from soldiers to teachers, underscoring the range of economic hardship across the country, and many are looking for ways to keep going.",
      "Some want cheap shoes, finding them not in supermarkets but in open markets where flip-flops and sandals are fashioned from worn-out tires usually thrown away as rubbish.",
      "In Wau, some 650 kilometers (400 miles) from the South Sudanese capital of Juba, shoemaker Emmanuel Achuil works under the shade of a tarpaulin in the town's bustling main market.",
      "His hands blackened from grappling with rubber, Achuil uses a blade to carve pieces from discarded tires. Colorful straps are scattered around him like pieces of a puzzle.",
      "Achuil, who makes five to 10 pairs a week, told the AP that in recent months he\u2019s seen a rise in demand that he and others say is directly related to the rising cost of living here. They say footwear made from scraps of rubber has found a firm place in local markets, confirmed in the ubiquitous displays of such shoes even in open markets in Juba.",
      "Two years ago, Achuil was getting five to seven customers a month. Now he expects up to 20 of them, he said. Achuil\u2019s shoes can fetch up to 15,000 South Sudanese pounds a pair, or roughly $4, depending on size and quality of finishing. In addition to their affordability, the rough-hewn pairs are praised for their durability.",
      "\u201cEven when things get bad \u2014 no food, no jobs \u2014 this work doesn\u2019t fail me,\u201d Achuil said. \u201cPeople always need shoes, especially cheap ones.\u201d",
      "Akol Majok Ring, a cattle-keeper from the state of Warrap, said he discovered these sandals in March and immediately bought a pair for himself because \u201cthey are good for cattle grazing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re moving with the cattle all day, these sandals are perfect,\" he said. \u201cThey\u2019re durable and well-suited for the job.\u201d",
      "The South Sudanese pound has been under pressure since 2023, losing much of its value against the dollar as oil exports are sporadically disrupted by civil war in neighboring Sudan.",
      "The economy has been in decline for five consecutive years, hampered by violence stemming mostly from the political contest between President Salva Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar, who is currently under house arrest for alleged subversion.",
      "Hyperinflation and widespread food insecurity affect nearly 80% of South Sudan's 11 million people, the same number of people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.",
      "South Sudan depends on oil revenues to meet 90% of the government\u2019s annual budget, but damage earlier this year to the oil pipeline through Sudan left South Sudanese authorities briefly unable to export any crude.",
      "The government announced earlier in June that exports were due to resume after repairs to the pipeline.",
      "Many government workers are effectively without pay, and unemployment is rampant even as the prices of basic goods skyrocket. Leather shoes in the shops can seem a luxury in these circumstances.",
      "\u201cTire soles last longer,\u201d said Deng Akol Athuai, who has been buying from Achuil for years. \u201cI buy one pair, and it lasts me a year or more. They\u2019re strong, especially for walking on rough roads.\u201d",
      "Gabriel Bataku, a 26-year-old who is unemployed in Wau, said of artisans that they \u201care solving real problems. They just need recognition and support.\u201d",
      "Achuil has been making shoes since 1996. He is not formally trained. He got his skills as a grade schooler watching older men in their workshops as they went about their business.",
      "In those days discarded tires were much easier to find, scavenged from garages or sourced through people throwing them away.",
      "But now, he said, \u201cmore people are doing this work, so the competition for materials is high.\u201d",
      "He lamented the lack of formal support, from the government and others, that has left artisans struggling to access the tools of their trade. He wants access to better equipment.",
      "Despite the difficulties, he dreams of opening a proper workshop where he would train others. He also hopes to be able to expand his business to other towns in South Sudan.",
      "\u201cIf I had better cutting tools, and a way to expand, I could train young people,\u201d he said. \u201cMany are idle here in Wau. This skill could help them survive.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a critical test in Sunday\u2019s upper house election",
      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces an increasingly uphill battle in Sunday\u2019s upper house election, and a loss could worsen political instability at a time of daunting challenges, such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs.",
      "A poor performance would not immediately trigger a change of government but it would deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan\u2019s future path.",
      "The ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered a humiliating loss in a lower house election in October as its usual supporters registered their unhappiness over past corruption scandals and high prices. Ishiba is struggling to regain voter confidence.",
      "His minority government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through the Diet, or parliament. That has hindered its ability to quickly deliver effective measures to curb rising prices and win wage increases. On top of shortages and soaring prices for rice, a traditional staple, Ishiba has been stymied by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff demands.",
      "Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties, including one that is promoting anti-foreign policies and backpedaling on gender equality and diversity.",
      "Here's a look at Sunday's election:",
      "Ishiba has set a low bar for the vote \u2014 a simple majority. Half of the 248 seats for six-year terms in the upper house are being decided, and the LDP and its junior coalition partner Komeito would need to win a combined 50. Added to the 75 coalition-held seats that are not being contested in this election, it would be a big retreat from the 141 seats the coalition held before the election.",
      "If the ruling coalition fails to secure a majority, \u201cthere will be a move within the LDP to dump Ishiba,\u201d said Yu Uchiyama, a University of Tokyo professor of political science. \u201cIt makes a leadership very unstable.\u201d Under any successor, the ruling coalition would be a minority in both houses, he said.",
      "If Ishiba's coalition secures a majority and he stays on, his leadership will remain weak, with little hope of improved support ratings, Uchiyama said. \u201cEither way, it is essential for the minority government to seek opposition parties\u2019 cooperation to achieve any policy.\u201d",
      "Measures to mitigate soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top focus of frustrated, cash-strapped voters.",
      "Rice prices have doubled since last year due to supply shortages, overly complex distribution systems and other reasons related to Japan\u2019s farming, causing panic buying as Ishiba has struggled to resolve the crisis.",
      "Trump has added to that pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations, blaming a lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba.",
      "Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.",
      "The rice issue has cost Ishiba one farm minister. Rice prices remain high even after the farm minister's replacement, Shinjiro Koizumi, moved quickly and boldly to address the problem by ordering the emergency release of stored rice from reserves, helping to refill grocery store shelves in time for the election.",
      "Koizumi, son of popular former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a potential challenger to Ishiba.",
      "Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have suddenly emerged as a key issue.",
      "The Sanseito party stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. It wants stricter screening for allowing Japanese citizenship and to exclude non-Japanese from welfare benefits. The party's populist platform is also anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.",
      "Its stance has encouraged the spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media, critics say. A typical claim is that a rapid increase in foreign workers has hurt Japanese workers\u2019 wages and that foreigners use a large share of welfare benefits and have made Japanese society unsafe.",
      "\u201cForeigners are used as targets to vent their discontent and unease,\u201d Uchiyama said, comparing the scapegoating to that in Europe and the United States under Trump.",
      "Experts say most of the rhetoric is disinformation aimed at frustrations among Japanese struggling to get by. Government statistics show foreign residents account for about 3% of both Japan\u2019s total population and of welfare benefit recipients.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, under a slogan \u201czero illegal immigrants,\u201d have pledged to crack down on growing illegal employment of foreigners and against allowing them to default on social insurance payments or medical bills. The party also set up a task force to promote an orderly society, a move aimed at enforcing stricter measures on foreigners to address growing public unease. The rising conservative Democratic Party for the People, or the DPP, also is calling to restrict foreign ownership of Japanese real estate.",
      "The move triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.",
      "Given that its population is rapidly aging and shrinking, Japan needs foreign workers. It should discuss immigration policy more strategically, Takahide Kiuchi, an executive economist at Nomura Research Institute, wrote in a recent analysis.",
      "Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats' expense.",
      "They are believed to be raking in conservative supporters of the ruling party who are disappointed by Ishiba's leadership and flip-flops on policies. Ishiba is caught between his party's ultraconservatives and mainstream opposition leaders.",
      "Still, the eight main opposition groups are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "When Ishiba lost big in October, there was speculation about a trilateral coalition government with the Komeito and the DPP or another conservative group, the Japan Innovation Party. But they've since cooperated only on certain legislation. If the ruling coalition loses its upper house majority, that could spark a regrouping among coalitions.",
      "Yoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and head of the opposition CDPJ, said the loss of ruling coalition majorities in both houses of parliament would enable opposition parties to push policies blocked by the LDP. Those include cuts in the consumption tax, recognition of same-sex marriages, and a law allowing married couples the option of each keeping their own names.",

    "story": [
      "Newer airport screening machines that operate like medical CT scanners are better at spotting liquid explosives, but many airports still lack that expensive equipment",
      "Travelers celebrated the suggestion that American airports might soon ease restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags that create endless hassles at security checkpoints, but more than a third of all airports around the country still haven't upgraded their screening systems to reliably detect liquid explosives that could bring down a plane.",
      "It may be annoying to have to dump water and other drinks before going through security, but the challenge is to detect the difference between things like harmless hair gel and more sinister substances. The threat nearly materialized in an attack in 2006, when authorities in the United Kingdom arrested a group that was plotting to blow holes in airliners with a homemade mixture of chemicals in sports drink bottles.",
      "Security experts remain concerned about the vulnerabilities that were exposed by that plot.",
      "Comments this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem got travelers excited about the prospect of one day being able to fly with more than 3 ounces of their shampoos and gels and not having to throw out the beverage they just bought.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it\u2019s still as safe.\u201d",
      "A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said Noem and the agency \u201care constantly looking for ways to enhance security, and improve the travel experience for the public.\u201d",
      "Any changes will come through the same official channels that TSA used to announce this month that travelers can keep their shoes on at checkpoints. That change offers relief from a rule adopted after \u201cshoe bomber\u201d Richard Reid\u2019s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001 with a small explosive device hidden in his footwear.",
      "The limits on liquids were triggered by the 2006 U.K. arrests. Three ringleaders were eventually convicted.",
      "Prosecutors told the jury in that case that authorities uncovered the plot after secretly searching the luggage of a man who was on their radar for security concerns after he returned from Pakistan and found the unusual combination of the Tang powdered soft drink and a large number of batteries, according to the BBC. That triggered the surveillance operation that eventually grew to include more than 200 officers.",
      "Agents discovered what appeared to be a bomb factory in a London apartment where odd devices were being constructed out of drink bottles. The plot didn't make sense until authorities discovered that the men were researching flight timetables and realized they were only trying to make an explosive big enough to rip a hole in a plane.",
      "The meaning of coded emails to contacts in Pakistan only became clear after the arrests, when authorities realized that the quantities of Calvin Klein aftershave being discussed in messages matched the amount of hydrogen peroxide the conspirators had purchased.",
      "Ever since then, the TSA and authorities in other countries have limited carry-on liquids and gels to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) because officials believe that amount is too small to create an explosion capable of taking down a plane. The restriction covered all types of liquids, because X-ray machines at checkpoints couldn't differentiate between explosive and harmless ones.",
      "The United Kingdom was planning to ease its restrictions last year to allow people to carry up to 2 liters (about half a gallon) of liquid, but that was delayed because several major airports still didn't have the new scanners that use computed tomography, commonly known as a CT scan, to produce clearer images.",
      "The new machines allow screeners to switch between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images and turn them to see what may be lurking, said Johnny Jones, secretary treasurer of the chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees that represents TSA workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a totally life-changing situation,\u201d said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the agency was created. \u201cIt\u2019s a difference of being able to see something that would have been hidden by something that you can now see clear as day with the new technology. It eliminates the guesswork.\u201d",
      "The problem is that only 255 of the 432 airports across the United States have new CT scanners installed, the interim head of the TSA told Congress this spring. The biggest airports got them first, but they are not expected to be everywhere until 2043.",
      "It's possible that a change in carry-on liquid policy could be implemented just at the biggest airports, but that could lead to confusion if travelers, are, say, allowed to bring full bottles on departure only to have them confiscated when they return.",
      "The scanners cost more than $2 million apiece, and they are so much bigger than the old X-ray machines that sometimes floors must be reinforced and checkpoints have to be redesigned.",
      "\u201cI think you need to hold off till we get more systems deployed. I think this one\u2019s a little too early,\u201d said Jeff Price, who teaches aviation security at Metropolitan State University of Denver and has co-authored books on the subject. \u201cThe keep your shoes on \u2014 I can get on board with that provided we continue to do random screenings. But the liquids, I think we\u2019re too early on that. There\u2019s other layers of security. Yeah, I know that. But not too many of them that prevent this type of attack.\u201d",
      "In the past the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted vulnerabilities in TSA screening that can allow things to slip through undetected.",
      "A 2015 report found that TSA officers failed 95% of the time to detect weapons or explosive material carried by undercover inspectors.",
      "But Jones defended the work of the screeners he represents, noting that since the agency's creation, no plane has failed to reach its destination because of something that was missed.",
      "\u201cNothing large has been able to make it through our system since we\u2019ve taken over screening. We've protected the skies for 22 years,\u201d Jones said. \u201cEven if you have a slight miss, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything is going to happen on the plane.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, setting new regulations for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to assets like the U.S. dollar",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law new regulations for a type of cryptocurrency, a major milestone for an industry that has spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might.",
      "The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility compared with other forms of cryptocurrency. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins.",
      "The new law is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the crypto industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to massive campaign donations and spending on lobbying. Its passage comes as Trump had repeatedly pledged to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" Trump told crypto industry executives at a White House bill signing attended by about 200 people, including several top GOP lawmakers. \u201cThis signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit.\u201d",
      "The crypto industry has long complained it was unfairly targeted by former President Joe Biden's administration and spent heavily to help Trump win last year's election.",
      "The president lavished praise on crypto leaders during his speech Friday, saying \u201cnobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time.\u201d",
      "Trump said helping the cryptocurrency industry was \u201cgood for the dollar and it\u2019s good for the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I backed you at an early stage,\u201d said Trump, who had previously been a skeptic of cryptocurrency before embracing it. His administration has taken several early steps to boost the crypto industry, including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropping several enforcement actions against large crypto companies.",
      "Trump then added a candid admission about the political calculus of his support for the crypto industry: \u201cAnd I also did it for the votes,\u201d he said, drawing laughter from the audience.",
      "The president also joked that lawmakers had named the GENIUS Act after him. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.\u201d",
      "The use of stablecoins has grown dramatically in recent years. Circle, the U.S.-based issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and quickly saw its value soar amid heavy interest from crypto enthusiasts and investors. Stablecoin issuers make profits by collecting the interest on the assets they hold in reserve to back their stablecoins.",
      "A provision in the GENIUS Act bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year and received an early boost from an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The House also passed two other bills Thursday that are meant to help the crypto industry. One creates a new market structure for cryptocurrency, and the other bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency. Both measures now go to the Senate.",

      "A federal judge has restored a Democrat to the Federal Trade Commission, ruling that President Donald Trump illegally fired her earlier this year in his efforts to exert control over independent agencies across the government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled late Thursday that federal law protects FTC commissioners from being removed by the president without cause, citing a key 1935 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the FTC.",
      "The decision allows Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to resume her duties as commissioner. The FTC website had been updated by Friday morning to show that Slaughter is among four sitting commissioners.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration almost immediately declared their intent to appeal, and the case could make its way to the Supreme Court. The conservative-led court already has narrowed the reach of the 90-year-old decision, known as Humphrey\u2019s Executor, and some justices have called for overturning it altogether.",
      "The high court also permitted Trump to fire the heads of other independent agencies. In May, the court allowed Trump to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, despite lower court rulings that Humphrey\u2019s Executor should protect them from arbitrary dismissal.",
      "The justices are currently weighing an emergency appeal from the administration to oust three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Trump fired them in May, but a federal judge restored them to their positions a month later.",
      "The legal fight over the firings also could extend to the Federal Reserve and the prospect of Trump firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. The justices suggested in May that Trump may not have the same freedom to upend the leadership of the Fed, describing it as \u201ca uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\u201d",
      "In her opinion, AliKhan said she was required to abide by the Humphrey\u2019s Executor decision, in which the court rebuffed President Franklin Roosevelt and held that FTC commissioners could be removed only for cause, not at the president\u2019s whim.",
      "She said her ruling would uphold \u201cclearly established law that has been enacted by a coequal branch of government, reaffirmed by another coequal branch, and acquiesced to by thirteen executives over the course of ninety years.\u201d",
      "But the judge acknowledged that hers probably would not be the last word. \u201cDefendants are, of course, free to take their quarrels with Humphrey\u2019s Executor to the Supreme Court. This court has no illusions about where this case\u2019s journey leads,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, the commission\u2019s two Democratic members in March. The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats typically include three members of the president\u2019s party and two from the opposing party. The commissioners sued to reclaim their jobs, saying they\u2019d been dismissed illegally. Slaughter has four years left in her term as commissioner. Bedoya submitted his resignation in June, and AliKhan dismissed his claim as a result.",
      "\u201cAs the Court recognized today, the law is clear, and I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Slaughter said in a statement Thursday.",
      "During a May court hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C., plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys warned against granting the president \u201cabsolute removal power over any executive officer,\u201d saying it would effectively eliminate an important check on his power.",
      "\u201cThat has never been the case in this country,\u201d said attorney Aaron Crowell. \u201cThat\u2019s not the law. That has never been the law.\u201d",
      "A politicized FTC also could favor powerful corporations while driving up prices for consumers, the lawyers for the fired commissioners said.",
      "But attorneys for the Trump administration argued that the FTC\u2019s role has expanded since the 1930s, and as such, its members should answer directly to the president.",
      "\u201cThe president should be able to remove someone who is actively blocking his policies, for example,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Emily Hall said during the hearing.",
      "AliKhan, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Joe Biden in 2023, noted the long line of presidents before Trump who didn\u2019t try to push the limits.",
      "Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once. They can be fired for displaying specific bad behaviors, including inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office.",
      "Trump told Bedoya and Slaughter that he was dismissing them because their service on the commission was inconsistent with his administration\u2019s priorities, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Chevron said Friday that it completed its acquisition of Hess shortly after the ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. Exxon had challenged Chevron\u2019s bid for Hess, one of three companies with access to the massive Stabroek Block oil field off the coast of Guyana.",
      "Guyana is a country of 791,000 people that is poised to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest offshore oil producer, placing it ahead of Qatar, the United States, Mexico and Norway. It has become a major producer in recent years.",
      "Oil giants Exxon Mobil, China\u2019s CNOOC, and Hess squared off in a heated competition for highly lucrative oil fields in northern South America.",
      "With Chevron getting the green light on Friday, it is now one of the major players in the Stabroek.",
      "\u201cWe disagree with the ICC panel\u2019s interpretation but respect the arbitration and dispute resolution process,\u201d Exxon Mobil said in a statement on Friday.",

      "\u201cGiven the significant value we\u2019ve created in the development of the Guyana resource, we believed we had a clear duty to our investors to consider our preemption rights to protect the value we created through our innovation and hard work at a time when no one knew just how successful this venture would become,\u201d Exxon Mobil said Friday. \u201cWe welcome Chevron to the venture and look forward to continued industry-leading performance and value creation in Guyana for all parties involved.\u201d",

      "Masai Ujiri is staying focused on his upcoming Giants of Africa Festival even as the longtime NBA executive navigates his recent departure from the Toronto Raptors",
      "NEW YORK -- Masai Ujiri's July is shaping up to be quite the rollercoaster ride. The recently-fired former Toronto Raptors executive is navigating his sudden departure from a franchise where he'd spent 13 seasons while also launching the second edition of his private foundation's Giants of Africa Festival \u2014 all within a one-month span.",
      "The humanitarian work, Ujiri pledged, will continue regardless of his employment status. The British-born NBA executive, raised in his father's native Nigeria, founded Giants of Africa in 2003 \u2014 back when he was just starting off as a scout and long before becoming the first African team president of a professional North American sports franchise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an obligation for me,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cIt\u2019s a passion.\u201d",
      "The foundation's ambitions have risen with his own success. Giants of Africa has reached thousands of campers across 18 countries. It has helped build more than three dozen courts on the continent. High-profile supporters include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's The Archewell Foundation. 2023\u2019s inaugural Giants of Africa Festival united more than 250 boys and girls around a week of basketball clinics, life skills lessons and community building that culminated in a concert headlined by South African superstar Tyla. The goal? A \u201cborderless Africa\u201d as Ujiri likes to say.",
      "The festival returns to Kigali, Rwanda, on July 26 with a lineup featuring Nigerian pop singer Ayra Starr and WNBA great Candace Parker. Two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard \u2014 brought to Toronto by Ujiri for the team's championship-winning 2018-2019 season \u2014 will mentor campers and train underserved youth.",
      "Ujiri discussed the upcoming event, and his future, with The Associated Press. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we had the last festival, we really focused on \u2014 whether it was the basketball, the life skills, the coaching, the mentorship \u2014 we focused on culture. We focused on the whole ecosystem of how we feel kids need this opportunity to grow. It really inspired us to think about how we bring this to more countries.",
      "We\u2019re doing this incredible, incredible fashion show showing the print, the threads of Africa, and who we really are. It used to be weird where you\u2019d see somebody wearing cloth from Africa. Now it\u2019s part of the fashion. It\u2019s part of us. It\u2019s just like Afrobeats \u2014 it\u2019s part of life everywhere. Everybody wants to wear a boubou. You see a lot of fashion designers from all over the world using our prints. We want to showcase that and give these youth the opportunity to see that this is how they can also expand their minds.",
      "A: It's been unbelievable. With these camps, it started off as basketball development, but you've seen that really become something that has really grown even bigger. I saw Pascal (Siakam), I saw (Joel) Embiid, I saw all these guys as youth in camps. Seeing them as 15-, 16-year-old kids in camp, you can't even project. And that tells you how much talent we have on the continent. I always say Africa's biggest jewel is the talent of the youth. One out of every four people in the world are going to be Africans by the year 2050 and the median age is 20. We should be investing on the continent.",
      "A: I'm the prime example of that. I didn't play in the NBA. I didn't even play high-level college or high-level Europe. The entry point for me was a scout in the NBA. From then on lots of people helped me to create this path that I'm on still. I go back to Basketball Without Borders, when the NBA gave me the opportunity to be a director. That has led to me becoming an executive in the NBA. That's the example I want to give.",
      "That's why we have so many people coming to this festival to really show these kids \u2014 whether it's me or a journalist or a sports doctor or sports lawyer \u2014 there's so many careers. And the start is sports and doing it passionately and doing it well.",
      "A: When I first started, I was doing boys camps. Not every kid is going to make it to the NBA. So we started focusing on life skills. That was teaching respect, honesty, being on time. One of the big focuses was respect for women.",
      "So, I'm challenging these boys but I'm not challenging myself. I can't say \u201cwomen's empowerment\u201d and \u201crespect women\u201d and just do these camps for boys. So, we introduced the girls. And it's not 50 boys and 10 girls just for token. It's equality. They all have a basketball and they have the same court time. We can't just say it. We actually have to do it.",
      "A: Job, no job, wherever I am, whatever kind of job I'm doing, Giants of Africa is key. The focus will always be that just because I owe it to the youth of the continent. I owe it to the continent. My goal is not how big does Giants of Africa get. I look at it as: how big are these youth going to become? They'll go on to do other things. They could go on to become a president or become a governor or become president of a team. The hope is that this experience here will even make them reimagine many of the things that they want to do. So, Giants of Africa will never go anywhere.",

      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election",
      "WASHINGTON -- If one theme has emerged in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, it's this: He's leveraged the power of his office for personal gain unlike anyone before in history.",
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election, an unprecedented flood of often shadowy money from billionaires, foreign governments and cryptocurrency tycoons with interests before the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe is president and is supposed to be working in the public\u2019s interest,\u201d said James Thurber, an emeritus professor at American University, who has researched lobbying, campaign finance and political corruption for decades. \u201cInstead, he is helping his own personal interest to grow his wealth. It\u2019s totally not normal.\u201d",
      "The sums amassed by the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the president\u2019s children, are far greater than those collected by the family during the president\u2019s first term, when patronage of his hotels, resorts and golf courses was de rigueur to curry favor with the famously transactional commander-in-chief.",
      "The second time around, the Trump family\u2019s ambitions are far grander, stretching from cyberspace to far-flung regions across the globe. One of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320 million since January, while another received a $2 billion investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550 million in tokens.",
      "His sons have jetted across the Middle East to line up new development deals, while his daughter and son-in-law are working with the Albanian government to build a Mediterranean island resort. Even first lady Melania Trump has inked a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, was a frequent target of Trump during his first presidency and whose companies contract extensively with the federal government.",
      "The dealmaking is a rejection of Trump\u2019s first-term pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and dwarfs the influence peddling efforts of former President Joe Biden\u2019s family, whom Trump and his allies attacked as the \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d",
      "While Democrats have condemned Trump for his overlapping roles as a beneficiary and president, he is not likely to face any immediate repercussions for such extensive conflicts-of-interest. Congress is controlled by fellow Republicans, and his administration is stocked with loyalists who have dismantled many guardrails of oversight. Last summer, the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by Trump, ruled that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Even in the rare cases where Trump\u2019s allies have urged caution, the president has ignored them. That\u2019s what happened when he accepted a $400 million \u201cbeautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane\u201d from the Qatari government. Trump said the Boeing 747 \u201cwould go directly\u201d to his presidential library upon leaving office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mount Everest of corruption\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Since Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan kept assets in a \u201cblind trust,\u201d while George H.W. Bush used a \u201cdiversified trust,\u201d which blocked him from knowing what was in his portfolio. His son, George W. Bush, used a similar arrangement.",
      "Barack Obama was an exception, but his investments were mostly a bland mix of index funds and U.S. treasuries. During his first term, Trump even gave a nod toward ethics. He issued a moratorium on foreign deals. But instead of placing his assets in a blind trust like many of his predecessors, he handed the reins of the Trump Organization to his children, which kept his financial holdings close.",
      "This time, he has made no such gesture. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., are again running the business while Trump is in office. And though the White House says he is not involved in its day-to-day decisions, the trust he has established continues to profit. He promotes his resorts, merchandise and the family\u2019s crypto ventures while residing in the White House, often from his account on Truth Social, the social media company he and his allies launched.",
      "He\u2019s also touted a line of Trump shoes, a Bible, which is made in China, and Trump guitars, one of which is a $1,500 Gibson Les Paul knockoff, featuring \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fret inlays. Conservative groups and Republican committees have spent at least $25 million at Trump properties since 2015, with most of it coming from Trump\u2019s own political organization, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Yet, those ventures pale in comparison to his exploits in cryptocurrency, which offers perhaps the clearest example of the conflicts of interest that have come to dominate Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump was once a crypto skeptic who declared that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money,\u201d were based on \u201cthin air\u201d and seemed \u201clike a scam.\u201d By the time he was running again for president, however, he\u2019d become a proponent of the industry.",
      "\u201cThe difference now is he has realized that it can be his scam,\u201d said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrencies.",
      "Trump has pledged to turn the U.S. into the \u201ccrypto capital of the world\u201d and promised to roll back oversight of the industry.",
      "Deregulation, of course, will help his own businesses. At the height of the campaign, Trump announced the launch of his own crypto coin and World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm that would be run by his sons and several business associates. Among those partners was Steve Witkoff, now one of Trump\u2019s top diplomatic envoys.",
      "The Trump Organization and World Liberty Financial declined to comment.",
      "But it was also rooted in his 2024 campaign. At a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, he received assurances that industry figures would spend lavishly to get him reelected, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "Asked recently at the White House if he'd consider having his family business step back from its crypto investments to avoid questions about conflicts of interest, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a very powerful industry. That\u2019s much more important than anything that we invest in.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about investing. You know, I have kids and they invest in it, because they do believe in it,\" Trump added of crypto. \"But I\u2019m president, and what I did do there was build an industry that\u2019s very important. And, if we didn\u2019t have it, China would.\u201d",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, reiterated that Trump's crypto boosterism isn't driven by self-interest.",
      "He \u201cis taking decisive action to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and to secure America\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leader in the digital asset economy,\u201d Fields said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration,\" Fields added, \"is fulfilling the president\u2019s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump is soon expected to sign cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress on Thursday. Among the provisions is a ban on members of Congress issuing their own brand of a particular type of cryptocurrency. The prohibition does not extend to the president.",
      "Fields said it was unfair to equate critics\u2019 charges of conflicts of interest against Trump with the president\u2019s own suggestions that Biden\u2019s family benefited financially while he was in office.",
      "He said Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t benefited the president personally and have nothing to do with his family\u2019s financial concerns \u2014 and said Trump entered the White House an already successful businessman who didn\u2019t need a political career to become rich.",
      "Even so, Trump\u2019s family is poised to benefit financially from the crypto industry\u2019s growing clout. It holds a majority ownership stake that entitles them to 75% of earnings from their first coin, released last September, according to World Liberty Financial\u2019s website.",
      "The coin, $WLFI, was not an immediate success. Then, after the president's election, sales took off.",

It has hovered around $10 since March. Trump did well, though. By the end of April, the coin had earned over $320 million in fees, according to an analysis by the crypto tracking firm Chainalysis.",

Amid this spree, the Trump administration announced it had paused a securities fraud case against him. In June, Sun announced he was taking his crypto company, Tron, public after securing financing through a deal brokered by Eric Trump. Last week, Sun posted on Twitter that he was purchasing an additional $100 million worth of Trump's meme coin.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy.",
      "About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. About half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them.",
      "Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, highlighting new deductions on tips and overtime income. But Democrats have been making the case that the wealthiest Americans will benefit from the legislation, citing cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "The new poll indicates that Republicans still have persuading to do. The high price tag may also be turning off some Americans. Trump's approval rating on government spending has fallen since the spring, according to the new survey, and about 6 in 10 U.S. adults across the political spectrum think the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "Most people have heard at least something about the new law, according to the poll, which found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults have heard or read \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d about it.",
      "Those who know something about the legislation are more likely to believe it favors the wealthy, compared with people who have heard \u201conly a little\u201d or \u201cnothing at all.\"",
      "Anaiah Barrow, a 25-year-old single mom from North Carolina who doesn't identify with a political party, said she\u2019s concerned that the new law will hurt caregivers like her. Barrow -- who\u2019s juggling a job, taking care of two young children and pursuing a degree -- is concerned about losing access to day care and food stamps.",
      "\u201cIt has a really big effect,\u201d Barrow said of the recently passed legislation, which she has learned about on TikTok. \u201cIt may not be as a big now, but in the long run it\u2019s going to have that effect -- it\u2019s going to hit bad.\u201d",
      "Even many Republicans agree that the wealthy are likely to benefit from the tax and spending law. About half say the law will do more to help the wealthy.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I would want to take away the incentive to become more wealthy \u2014 that\u2019s the American dream,\u201d Putnam said.",
      "But she also thinks she'll end up paying more in taxes. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing I'm sure he thinks is correct,\" she said of Trump. \"It\u2019s just the extreme method that he\u2019s using.\u201d",
      "The law's hefty price tag may be factoring into some Americans' assessments of the law. The poll found they are less likely to approve of how Trump is handling government spending since the spring.",
      "Just 38% of Americans approve of how Donald Trump is handling government spending, compared with 46% in an AP-NORC poll conducted in March.",
      "Republicans are less likely to say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d than they were in March 2023, when Joe Biden was president, but about 6 in 10 still think the government is overspending. A similar share of Democrats say the same thing.",

      "\u201cThe message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,\u201d Kaja Kallas said in a statement.",
      "Kallas said the measures amount to \u201cone of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date\u201d linked to the war, now in its fourth year. It comes as European countries start to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine to help the country better defend itself.",

      "\u201cAll infrastructure of Russia\u2019s war must be blocked,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine will synchronize its sanctions with the EU and introduce its own additional measures soon.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, had proposed to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price to target Russia\u2019s vast energy revenues. The 27 member countries decided to set the price per barrel at just under $48.",
      "The EU had hoped to get major international powers in the Group of Seven countries involved in the price cap to broaden the impact, but conflict in the Middle East pushed up oil prices and the Trump administration could not be brought onboard.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "A new import ban was also imposed in an attempt to close a loophole allowing Russia to indirectly export crude oil via a number of non-EU countries.",
      "The EU also targeted the Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany to prevent Putin from generating any revenue from them in future, notably by discouraging would-be investors. Russian energy giant Rosneft's refinery in India was hit as well.",
      "The pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were targeted by sabotage in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "On top of that, the new EU sanctions targeted Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. Two Chinese banks were added to the list.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022.",

      "But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree, as measures targeting Russia bite the economies of the 27 member nations. Slovakia held up the latest package over concerns about proposals to stop Russian gas supplies, which it relies on.",
      "The last raft of EU sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers. On Friday, 105 more ships were blocked from European ports, locks and from ship-to-ship transfers, bringing the total number of vessels now sanctioned to more than 400.",

Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.",
      "Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan\u2019s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.",
      "U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.",
      "Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from",
      "The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.",
      "\u201cTrump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,\u201d said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so \u201cawash in the fuel\u201d that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.",
      "\u201cNot good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.",
      "Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.",
      "Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace\u2014making it harder to switch to renewables later. \u201cAnd you\u2019re more likely then to get stuck for longer,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.",
      "LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it\u2019s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.",
      "Many LNG contracts include \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don\u2019t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.",
      "Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.",
      "Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.",
      "South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year \u2014 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam \u2014 with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea\u2019s \u2014 would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.",
      "Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.",
      "Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.",
      "A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. \u201cThe U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,\u201d he said.",
      "LNG only contributes to energy security when it\u2019s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the bit that they leave out ... But it\u2019s pretty important,\u201d he said.",
      "This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.",
      "\u201cEvents in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,\u201d Kenner said.",
      "Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia\u2019s solar and wind potential is being used.",
      "\u201cThere are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,\u201d he said.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- World shares were mostly higher on Friday after Wall Street rose to records following better-than-expected updates on the economy and a mixed set of profit reports from big U.S. companies.",
      "In early European trading, Germany's DAX was up 0.4% at 24,479.86. In Paris, the CAC 40 rose 0.6% to 7,869.86, while Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.2% to 8,987.81.",

      "In Asian trading Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 closed 0.2% lower at 39,819.11 as traders stayed on the sidelines ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament on Sunday that could wipe out the ruling coalition\u2019s upper house majority.",
      "The government reported that core inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices rose to 3.3% in June from a year earlier, slowing from 3.7% in May but still above the central bank\u2019s 2% target.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index added 1.2% to 24,825.66, while the Shanghai Composite index advanced 0.5% to 3,534.48.",

On Thursday, TSMC reported its net income soared nearly 61% in the last quarter from a year earlier.

      "Treasury yields were mixed following several better-than-expected reports on the economy.",
      "One said that shoppers upped their spending  at U.S. retailers by more last month than economists expected. Such spending, along with a relatively solid jobs market, has helped keep the U.S. economy out of a recession.",
      "A separate report said that fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week, which could be a signal of limited layoffs. A third suggested unexpectedly strong growth in manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region.",
      "Such solid data could keep the Federal Reserve on pause when it comes to interest rates. The Fed has been keeping rates steady this year, after cutting them at the end of last year.

      "President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.",
      "Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.",
      "The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.",
      "The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said.",
      "Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that \u201ccritical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet.",
      "Trump\u2019s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.",
      "Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a \u201cpolluters\u2019 portal\u201d that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother\u2019s womb.",
      "Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.",
      "The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.",
      "John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump\u2019s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were \u201cpretexts\u201d so he could help big corporations get richer.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,\u2033 Walke said. \u201cIf your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.\u201d",
      "In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency\u2019s website lists 47 power providers \u2014 which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants \u2014 that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\"",
      "An Associated Press examination of the proposed rollbacks concluded that rules targeted by the EPA could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect. The AP review included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.",
      "In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s actions provide much needed regulatory relief for the power sector and help ... unleash American energy,\" Zeldin said.",

      "Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said in a speech in New York City that the economy is showing signs of weakening, with consumer spending slowing and job gains cooling. The Fed should reduce borrowing costs to shore up spending and growth before the job market weakens further, Waller said.",
      "\u201cThe economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly,\u201d he said, adding that the slowdown threatens the Fed\u2019s goal of maximum employment.",
      "At the same time, President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are likely to only lift inflation temporarily and aren't a reason to postpone rate cuts, Waller said.",
      "\u201cTariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the (Fed's) 2% objective this year,\u201d Waller said, but policymakers should \u201clook through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation,\u201d which he said is nearing the 2% goal.",
      "Waller has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Powell when the current chair\u2019s term expires in May 2026, or perhaps earlier if Trump takes the unprecedented step of firing Powell. Trump has threatened to fire Powell this year but on Wednesday said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he would take such a step.",
      "For his part, Powell has said the Fed wants to see the impact of the duties on prices and the economy before making any moves.",

      "Other potential replacements for Powell have also publicly expressed support for cutting rates soon, including Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's board who stepped down in 2011. Warsh, currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution, said on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d earlier this week that he supported rate cuts.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has hinted at possible changes to TSA's liquid restrictions",
      "NEW YORK -- When limits on liquids were introduced at TSA checkpoints across the country in 2006, bins overflowed with bottled water, toothpaste, shaving cream and so much more. Nearly two decades later, travelers are much more accustomed to the \u201c3-1-1\u201d regulations\" governing the size of the liquids they're flying with, but scenes of passengers guzzling a beverage before putting their bags through the screening machines are still common.",
      "That's why Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent ripples through the traveling public when she said earlier this week that changes might be afoot when it comes to the TSA's current liquid limits.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem told a conference in Washington.",
      "Will travelers be able to carry bigger bottles? Multiple 1-quart bags of liquids? Those details haven't been rolled out. But coming on top of her announcement earlier this month that travelers could keep their shoes on at TSA checkpoints, it seems a much different security experience for American air travelers might be emerging.",
      "Airline travel changed dramatically after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Before that, airlines were responsible for security and would often contract it out to private firms, said Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. Travelers often didn't need to show their ID at security checkpoints \u2014 and people without boarding passes, such as family members or friends, could go to the gate in some locations.",
      "\u201cIt was much more casual. And clearly it was ineffective, because 9/11 occurred,\u201d Hartevelt said.",
      "That's when the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration were born, with the mandate of preventing more terrorist attacks.",
      "The liquid limits, however, didn\u2019t kick in until 2006, after authorities foiled a plot that used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage. The TSA then very briefly banned all liquids in carry-on luggage. That ban lasted about six weeks, but strained airlines\u2019 baggage systems as more and more travelers turned to checked bags to pack toiletries.",
      "At the time the 3.4-ounce limit was implemented, the FBI and other laboratories had found that tiny amounts of substances small enough to fit into a quart-size bag couldn\u2019t blow up an airliner.",
      "When the ban was eventually lifted in September 2006, consumers and businesses alike had to learn how to adapt to the 3-1-1 rule \u2014 leading to more demand for smaller, travel size bottles of anything from shampoo to toothpaste, as well as clear, \u201cTSA approved\u201d toiletry bags that are still seen on store shelves today.",
      "The rule was also adopted in many countries around the world starting later that year.",
      "Keith Jeffries, a former TSA director at Los Angeles International Airport and now vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, says whatever comes next needs to be clear for passengers. And he knows whereof he speaks.",
      "Jeffries was working for TSA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the liquids rules came down overnight. Signage had to be changed to let passengers know of the new regulations. Barrels overflowing with toothpaste, shaving cream and shampoo had to be emptied every half hour. Jeffries remembers seeing a pair of shoes sitting in one of the barrels.",
      "When he asked why, a TSA staffer said there was gel in the soles. \u201cI said, 'Please tell me I don\u2019t have a passenger back there walking in the sterile area barefoot. And he says, 'No, sir, they still have their socks on,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how chaotic it was.\u201d",
      "Any move to simplify the screening process and cut down on the time it takes for passengers to navigate checkpoints would be a welcome change for everyone, Harteveldt says. Because it isn\u2019t just about convenience; those lines before the security checkpoints are the most at risk to a potential threat.",
      "The fact that the TSA felt confident enough to change its shoe policy earlier this month may not save too much time from an individual traveler\u2019s perspective, Harteveldt notes \u2014 but marks a \u201cbig step forward\u201d toward cutting down the average length of the security process when you think about the number of people going through U.S. airports each day. Relaxing current liquid restrictions could aid that effort.",
      "Still, questions remain. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what the secretary is going to announce about liquids,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cWill they remove the liquid ban altogether \u2014 and can we go back to bringing full-sized of toiletries and other items with us? Will they allow people to bring more than one bag of toiletries and liquids? And importantly, will they relax the limit on (the) quart-size bag itself?\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also possible that the changes the TSA makes, whatever they are, only start at a handful of airports that have the technology to do so. Over the years, airports worldwide have adopted some aspects of security screenings faster or differently than others.",
      "But travelers could be confused if they\u2019re able to bring a full-size bottle of shampoo or lotion when flying out of one airport, for example, but not on their return trip home.",
      "\u201cThe devil is going to be in the details,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rollout plan will be absolutely critical.\u201d",
      "Harveldt says a more streamlined process could make travelers less stressed, but others \u2014 including flight attendants and pilots who are in the skies more frequently \u2014 may object and question whether airport security is being compromised. Still, Harveldt says he doesn\u2019t believe the TSA would make this change if the agency \u201cdidn\u2019t feel it was authentically, truly safe.\"",
      "If shoe regulations disappear and liquid restrictions are eased, the effects could ripple into the TSA PreCheck program, in which passengers submit information like their fingerprints and the agency prescreens them for any red flags. By giving the agency this information, the traveler then gets some benefits not available to other travelers \u2014 a special line to go through and the ability to keep their computers in their bags and their shoes on, for example.",
      "But if those benefits become more widely available to all passengers, will fewer people sign up for PreCheck?",
      "\u201cWhat is the impact on now both shoes and liquids going to have on TSA PreCheck enrollment? That is the million-dollar question,\" Jeffries said. \u201cAnd if I was still with TSA, I would be watching that closely over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d",
      "While the prospect of increasing the current liquid limit could be a welcome change for many U.S. travelers, some experts say that the tech isn\u2019t available in enough airports yet. Current X-ray machines used at most airports today have a difficult time distinguishing between different types of liquids, says Jeffrey Price, a professor of aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver.",
      "That\u2019s key, he explains, in determining whether something is harmless or potentially explosive.",
      "While newer computed tomography scanners are better and have begun making their way to airports, Price said in commentary published last week that it could take \u201canother decade or more\u201d before the newer machines are deployed at all U.S. airports.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that needs to be studied much more carefully than the policy to leave your shoes on,\u201d he said in an email Thursday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the agency's renovation of two of its buildings is in compliance with plans approved by a local commission, disputing a White House suggestion that they may have violated the law by deviating from those plans.",
      "The letter is the lastest salvo in an escalating battle between the Federal Reserve, an independent agency charged with fighting inflation and seeking maximum employment, and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has for months criticized Powell and the Fed for not lowering its key interest rate, which the president says would boost borrowing and accelerate the economy.",
      "Powell has said he wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which could raise inflation and slow growth, before making any moves.",
      "Trump has even threatened to fire Powell, though he has since backed away and said Wednesday it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he would take the unprecedented step of doing so. Firing the Fed chair could cause chaos in the financial markets. Several executives of Wall Street banks have said this week that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics is crucial.",
      "Still, the Trump administration has seized on ballooning costs for the Fed's renovation of two century-old buildings to argue that Powell has mismanaged the project. The president can't fire the Fed chair because of a policy disagreement, but he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is widely seen as some kind of malfeasance or neglect.",
      "Last week, the president's top budget adviser, Russell Vought, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d by Powell's management of the project, which has risen in cost to about $2.5 billion, up from the Fed's initial estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "Vought's letter also noted that Powell, in testimony before the Senate last month, said that the Fed removed some amenities that critics called ostentatious from its plans. Those plans had been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.",
      "Vought said in his letter that if the renovation plans had changed, they were no longer \u201cin compliance with the approved plan\" and may violate the National Capital Planning Act.",
      "Powell responded Thursday that since the Fed\u2019s plans were approved by the NCPC in September 2021, it has made only \u201ca small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements\u201d and added that the changes weren\u2019t significant enough to \u201cwarrant... further review.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe project is proceeding in accordance with the plan that the NCPC approved,\u201d Powell wrote.",
      "The changes were intended \u201cto simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,\u201d Powell said in his letter.",
      "Powell also defended the cost of the renovation: \u201cBoth buildings were in need of significant structural repairs,\u201d including \u201cthe removal of asbestos and lead contamination,\u201d as well as the \u201ccomplete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and suppression systems,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth built upon its video streaming service\u2019s more than 300 million subscribers",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth as the video streaming service's more than 300 million subscribers have become increasingly attractive to advertisers.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar script that Netflix has followed for the past three years to widen its lead in video streaming while delivering financial results that have usually easily exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors.",
      "While Netflix's profit eclipsed Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a wide margin in the April-June quarter, its revenue came in right around the bar set by analysts. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a 46% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion. Management also slightly raised its revenue forecast for the entire year, citing a belief that its programming lineup will reel in more subscribers in the second half than the first.",
      "Netflix\u2019s shares slipped 1% in extended trading, indicating investors expected an even more robust performance. But that is a minor stumble, given Netflix's stock price has soared 43% this year. The stock's strong run began during the second half of 2022 when the company introduced a low-priced version of its service with commercial interruptions as an antidote to an abrupt downturn in subscribers.",
      "The video streaming service is also faring well in Hollywood, as evidenced by the 120 Emmy nominations showered upon its programs earlier this week \u2013 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s HBO Max. In the past quarter, Netflix hailed \u201cSirens,\u201d \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d as being among its most watched programming.",
      "The popularity of Netflix\u2019s scripted programming combined with weekly World Wrestling Entertainment spectacles, high-profile boxing matches and periodic National Football League games have enabled its service to retain subscribers while its prices rise, including on the cheapest tier.",

      "That\u2019s according to new research from New York University, obtained exclusively by The Associated Press, which suggests the time restriction could affect as many as 1.4 million households helped by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "The NYU report also raises concerns about the largely untested policy, as most of the limited number of local housing authorities that have voluntarily tried the idea eventually abandoned the pilots.",
      "\u201cIf currently assisted households are subject to a two-year limit, that would lead to enormous disruption and large administrative costs,\" for public housing authorities, the report said, adding that once the limit was up, housing authorities \"would have to evict all of these households and identify new households to replace them.\u201d",
      "Amid a worsening national affordable housing and homelessness crisis, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is determined to reshape HUD\u2019s expansive role providing stable housing for low-income people, which has been at the heart of its mission for generations.",
      "At a June congressional budget hearing, HUD Secretary Scott Turner argued reforms like time limits will fix waste and fraud in public housing and Section 8 voucher programs while motivating low-income families to work toward self-sufficiency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s broken and deviated from its original purpose, which is to temporarily help Americans in need,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHUD assistance is not supposed to be permanent.\u201d",
      "Elderly and disabled people would be exempted, but there\u2019s little guidance from the agency on how time-limited housing assistance would be implemented \u2014 how it would be enforced, when the clock starts and how the exemptions would be defined.",
      "The NYU researchers dove deep into HUD\u2019s nationwide data over a 10-year period, analyzing nearly 4.9 million households that have been public housing and Section 8 voucher tenants. Of that, about 2.1 million could be affected by the time limits because they include at least one adult who is not elderly or disabled and about 70% of those households had already been living on those subsidies for two or more years.",
      "HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett pushed back on the NYU study.",
      "\u201cThere is plenty of data that strongly supports time limits and shows that long-term government assistance without any incentive disincentivizes able-bodied Americans to work,\u201d Lovett said in a statement.",
      "The time limits could displace more than a million children, as it would largely punish families who are working but still earning far below their area\u2019s median income.",
      "\u201cHousing assistance is especially impactful for children,\u201d said Claudia Aiken, the director of new research partnerships for the Housing Solutions Lab at NYU's Furman Center who co-authored the study with Ellie Lochhead. Their health, education, employment and earnings potential can \u201cchange in really meaningful ways if they have stable housing,\u201d Aiken said.",
      "Havalah Hopkins, a 33-year-old single mom, has been living in a public housing unit outside of Seattle since 2022, but now fears a two-year time limit would leave her and her teenage son homeless. The 14-year-old boy has autism but is considered high-functioning, so how HUD defines disabled and \u201cable-bodied\u201d for the time limit could determine if their family will be affected by the restriction.",
      "Hopkins, who does catering work for a local chain restaurant, pays $450 a month in rent \u2014 30% of her household income \u2014 for their two-bedroom apartment in Woodinville, Washington.",
      "Asked what she likes most about her home, Hopkins said: \u201cI like that I can afford it.\u201d",
      "Of the 17 housing authorities that tried time limits, 11 discontinued the trial. None tried two-year limits \u2014 the most common policy was a five-year limit with the option for an extra two and the limits usually applied to specific programs or referrals.",
      "Although there are over 3,000 housing authorities in the country, only 139 of them have ever been granted flexibility to consider testing a time limit while using federal funds for programs such as job training and financial counseling.",
      "\u201cAny conversation about time limits ends up being this really nuanced, hyper-local focus on what works for specific communities rather than this broad national-level implementation,\u201d said Jim Crawford, director of the Moving to Work Collaborative which oversees that group of housing authorities.",
      "Even with those supports, several housing authorities said rent was still too high and well-paying jobs were scarce, according to the study. Others said they didn\u2019t have enough capacity to provide enough supportive services to help households afford rent.",
      "Shawnt\u00e9 Spears of the Housing Authority of the County of San Mateo in California said the agency's five-year time limits have \u201cgiven folks motivation\u201d to meet their goals in tandem with self-sufficiency programs funded by dollars Trump wants to cut. Time limits also give more households the chance to use vouchers, she said.",
      "But with the Bay Area\u2019s high rents, some tenants still have to spend more than half of their income on rent once their time is up or end up back on waitlists.",
      "\u201cI believe the program is very helpful in getting folks prepared but there lies this really, really significant rent burden here in our county,\u201d said Spears. \u201cWhen folks do leave our time-limited program, they are facing an uphill battle.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Manny Pacquiao pushed back against his doubters, the odds and even Father Time on Saturday night \u2014 and nearly made some history.",
      "But Pacquiao, in the end, fell just short on the judges' scorecards as Mario Barrios escaped with a majority draw to retain the WBC welterweight championship. Two judges scored the bout a draw, and judge Max DeLuca awarded Barrios a 115-113 victory.",

      "Pacquiao, enshrined into the International Boxing Hall of Fame last month, was trying to break his own record for oldest welterweight champion. He was 40 when he emerged in 2019 split decision over Keith Thurman. This also was his first appearance in the ring in nearly four years for the 46-year-old Filipino, a loss by unanimous decision to Yordenis Ug\u00e1s.",
      "Barrios, a 30-year-old from San Antonio, was a -275 favorite at BetMGM Sportsbook. He hoped to bounce back from a split-decision draw on Nov. 15 against Abel Ramos, but didn't exactly come away with an emphatic victory in improving to 29-2-2. The heavily pro-Pacquiao crowd loudly booed the decision.",

      "\u201cHis stamina is crazy. He\u2019s still strong as hell and his timing is real. He\u2019s still a very awkward fighter to try to figure out.\"",
      "Pacman (62-9-2) moved swiftly around the ring from the beginning, often looking more like the younger champion who captured 12 world titles in eight divisions. He began to be take control in the seventh, lantding several big left hands to win the following three rounds on two cards and two on the other.",
      "But Barrios was the better fighter at the end, coming out more aggressive knowing he might be in trouble with the judges. All three, in fact, awarded Barrios each of the final three rounds.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think the fight was getting away from me, but I knew I had to step it up to solidify a win,\" Barrios said.",
      "Both sides they would be interested in a rematch.",
      "\u201cI hope this is an inspiration to boxers that if you have discipline and work hard you can still fight at this age,\" Pacquiao said.",
      "Sebastian Fundora (23-1-1, 15 KOs) retained his WBC super welterweight title when Tim Tszyu (25-3) didn't come out for the eighth round in the co-main event. Fundora floored Tszyu with a left hand in the first round and dominated the action with 118 power punches, according to Compubox, by repeatedly backing down the Australian.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the bigger guy,\" said Fundora, who led 69-63 on all three judges' cards. \"Everyone says I\u2019m a bully in the ring, so I thought I should start really bullying these guys. I just kept working on aggression my whole career and we\u2019ve just been adding.\u201d",
      "It was a big week for Fundora, who was accepted into Harvard and then won the rematch with Tszyu. The first fight on March 30, 2024 was much closer, with Fundora emerging with a split-decision victory.",

      "\u201cPeople think as athletes, we should take what comes our way,\u201d Sky guard Ariel Atkins said. \u201cWe are human and some comments that people make are inhumane. It\u2019s phenomenal of our organization to take care of us.\u201d",

      "China's Ministry of State Security says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it says threaten national security",
      "BANGKOK -- China's state security agency says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths minerals that it says threaten national security, just weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to make it easier for American firms to obtain from China those materials, which are critical for manufacturing and computer chip production.",
      "In a report published Friday in the state-run newspaper Global Times, the Ministry of State Security said foreign \u201cespionage and intelligence agencies\u201d were colluding to steal rare earths-related goods by repackaging and relabeling rare metals to hide their Chinese origin.",
      "In some cases the minerals were falsely declared as non-controlled items, mislabeled as such things as \u201csolder paste,\u201d mixed into other materials like ceramic tiles, or hidden in plastic mannequins or bottled water, it said.",
      "It referred only to an unnamed \u201ccertain country\u201d that it said lacked the capacity to make and refine its own rare earths.",
      "Investigations had found Chinese criminals were involved, exploiting shipping and delivery channels to evade controls on exports of the materials used in many high-tech applications including electric vehicle batteries, it said.",
      "The crackdown followed a report by Reuters earlier this month detailing how rare earths were being transshipped to the U.S. via Thailand and Mexico.",
      "China is the main source for many strategically vital rare earths and it has moved to slow exports of such minerals in retaliation for steep import duties President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods since he returned to the White House and launched his crusade to overturn a global trading system he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "That followed an earlier series of restrictions by Beijing on exports of such materials as gallium, germanium, antimony and tungsten in response to trade friction with the administration of then-President Joe Biden.",
      "In April, Beijing imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements, under a Chinese law that applies to all exports, not just those bound for the U.S. market.",
      "With the permitting process taking 45 days, the new requirement caused a pause in shipments, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world. The U.S., meanwhile, added to restrictions on exports of advanced technologies to China.",
      "Rare earths have remained at the center of China-U.S. talks aimed at staving off huge tariff increases that were postponed in May to allow time for negotiations on a broader trade agreement. The deadline for reaching a deal is Aug. 12.",
      "An agreement announced in late June did not remove China\u2019s permitting requirement on rare earths, but Beijing agreed to flexibility in dialing up or down the approval process as needed.",
      "Computer chips are another key bone of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Friday that it had taken note of a decision by the Trump administration to lift restrictions on exports of key semiconductors used in artificial intelligence made by Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices.",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China \u2014 as well as MI308 chips from AMD.",
      "But Commerce Ministry spokesman Wang Wentao said restoring healthy trade ties will require more action by Washington.",
      "U.S. export controls on Ascend chips made by Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies have hurt the interests of Chinese companies, Wang told reporters in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and correct their wrong practices through equal consultation, create a good environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between enterprises of both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor production and supply chain,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cHow to say you\u2019re from Rostov without saying a word? Show one bar of cellphone service,\" Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around the city, smartphone in hand. \"We have internet until 12 o'clock, and recently there\u2019s been no connection at all. No need to be angry, just get used to it already.\u201d",
      "The complaints by Osipyan \u2014 unable to pay electronically for groceries, or having to use paper maps while driving \u2014 aren't isolated to Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and, as home to Russia's Southern Military District, is targeted frequently by drones.",
      "In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials say are needed to foil Ukrainian drones, have hit dozens of Russian regions \u2014 from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported.",
      "Russians contacted by The Associated Press talked about card payments not going through, taxi and ride-sharing apps not working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail.",
      "Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where the Kremlin already has significantly curtailed online freedom.",
      "Such shutdowns in the name of security legitimize them to the public and open the door for authorities abusing the restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the Access Now digital rights group.",
      "Experts say the trend began in May, when Russia celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazi Germany in World War II and foreign dignitaries flocked to Moscow for a big military parade.",
      "The capital suffered severe disruptions of cellphone connectivity to the internet for days, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions due to regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked how long they'd last, he replied, \"This will be done as needed.\u201d",
      "Russia has restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests, as well as in regions bordering Ukraine.",
      "Shutdowns in the capital, however, sent a signal to authorities across the vast country that it\u2019s a useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s \"Operation Spiderweb\u201d in early June, in which drones launched from containers on trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials all the more eager to take action, Darbinyan said.",
      "\u201cThey got really scared that drones now may appear, like a jack-in-the-box, in any Russian regions,\u201d he told AP.",
      "By mid-July, deliberate shutdowns spread to most of the country, according to Na Svyazi \u2014 Russian for \u201cstaying connected\u201d \u2014 an activist group tracking internet availability.",
      "On Tuesday, the group reported cellphone internet shutdowns in 73 of over 80 regions. In 41 of them, there were reports of broadband network outages as well, while restrictions on broadband internet occurred in six regions, while cellphone connections were fine.",
      "Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet was restricted for security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov. Gleb Nikitin said this month the measure will stay in place in the region east of Moscow for \u201cas long as the threat remains.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said \u201ceverything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.\u201d",
      "Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere.",
      "In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in \u201ca cave\u201d in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day.",
      "Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara \"goes out at the most unpredictable moments,\u201d said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 p.m., staying that way for a few hours, she said.",
      "Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel any super strong discomfort,\" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. \"I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.\u201d",
      "In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge.",
      "Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks.",
      "A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov\u2019s social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbors of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area.",
      "Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.",
      "But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations.",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps.",
      "Access to YouTube \u2014 wildly popular in Russia \u2014 was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.",
      "State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones.",
      "Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign \u201cto establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,\u201d said the ISW's Stepanenko.",
      "Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's \u201cvery disturbing\u201d that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns.",
      "\u201cThis shouldn't be modern reality,\u201d she said.",

      "An advisory board convened by OpenAI says it should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone",
      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",
      "\u201cThey know this is profoundly important what\u2019s happening in this \u2018Age of Intelligence,\u2019 but they want to understand better what it is, how it\u2019s developed, where are the important choices being made and who\u2019s making them?\u201d he said.",
      "Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the company\u2019s senior engineers, who they said, \u201centered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available.",
      "The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people.",
      "\u201cFor OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good - it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities,\u201d he said.",
      "The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and \u201ca sign of the times.\"",

      "Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",
      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",
      "ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission.",
      "In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document.",
      "While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches.",
      "\u201cHistorically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,\" he said. \"You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.\u201d",
      "He added, however, that \"you still need a human being in the loop. You can\u2019t just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such \u201cAI agents\" is now a key focus for the tech industry.",
      "More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent.",
      "Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes.",
      "Six months later, however, after completing a proof-of-concept phase, the city didn't buy a full license for the technology due to the cost.",
      "The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of \u201cagentic AI\u201d projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, \u201cdue to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.\u201d",
      "San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers \u201cin the bowels of bureaucracy\u201d to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just an amazing amount of bureaucracy that large organizations have to have,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",

    "story": [
      "For 37 years in a searing California desert, runners from across the globe have embarked on a 135-mile race through one of the hottest places on Earth",
      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",
      "\u201cI'm just out there longer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut still getting it done.\u201d",
      "Tony Wolf, kinesiology professor at the University of Georgia, said aging adults generally have reduced heart function compared to younger adults. When combined with the cardiovascular demand of exercise and heat stress, it can cause difficulties.",
      "There isn\u2019t much research about how the bodies of fit older adults, including competitive athletes, regulate internal temperature. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of people in their 60s and older who are doing those kinds of events,\u201d said Wolf.",
      "Studies focused on adults before and after a training program found that exercise improved heart function and thermoregulation. That could suggest that the heart and thermoregulation impairments linked to aging are largely mitigated by lifelong fitness, Wolf said.",
      "The runners are spread out now, their flashing lights twinkling in the distance. This night is the toughest for Westergaard as sleep deprivation sets in. He zigzags on the road, barely awake. The runners ahead of him look like they're running toward him.",
      "In past years, his hallucinations have included people luring him to rest on couches that were actually bushes. Another time, he struck up a conversation with a kid skateboarding by him with a dog. And once, he watched for hours as a guy swung off the edge of the crescent moon, waving down at him.",
      "\u201cIt was just clear as day,\u201d Westergaard said of the hallucination.",
      "At 3:10 a.m. at mile 98 (157.72 kilometers), he sleeps for 15 minutes under the moonlight.",
      "\u201cNo one really quite understands\u201d why he does this, said Madison.",
      "At 11:50 a.m. and around mile 123 (197.95 kilometers), Westergaard shuffles through the town of Lone Pine. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S., soars some 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) into the blue sky.",
      "A crowd claps and cheers as he runs by.",
      "\u201cGo Danny, go!\u201d yelled a man.",
      "It's 92 F (33.33 C) as he approaches the final 4,750 foot (1,447.8 meters) mountain ascent to the finish line. Westergaard is walking at a snail's pace and says he\u2019s falling asleep. But his smile hasn\u2019t waned.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way,\u201d Westergaard said, Madison pacing behind and spraying him.",
      "\u201cLong way for a burger!\u201d she responded. They giggle while thinking about the veggie burger they'll buy upon finishing.",
      "Then he does, crossing the finish line with his crew at exactly 45 hours and 29 minutes.",
      "It was his most special Badwater 135 race by far, he says misty eyed, having Meagan and Madison at his side.",

      "A coalition of philanthropic funders will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools to help spur economic mobility",
      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",
      "Researchers like those at the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in humanitarian action have studied some of the risks associated with using AI tools when interacting with sensitive populations or handling high-stakes interactions, for example, in humanitarian contexts.",
      "They recommend assessing whether AI is the best tool to solve the problem and, crucially, if it works reliably and accurately enough in high-risk settings. They also recommend assessing tools for bias, considering privacy protections and weighing the cost of potential dependence on a specific provider.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology also emphasizes that trustworthy AI systems should be accountable to users and that it should be possible to explain or trace how a tool arrived at a certain conclusion or decision.",
      "Hooks emphasized that any AI tools NextLadder invests in will be shaped by the needs and feedback of these frontline workers. Tools that don't work for them, won't succeed, he said. Even with the potential risks of AI tools, he said it's imperative that groups that are struggling to move up the economic ladder have access to new technologies.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we would deprive those who are struggling in our country from the benefits of the leading edge solutions is unacceptable,\u201d Hooks said.",

      "The Trump administration has revoked $4 billion in federal funding for California's long-delayed high speed rail project",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

    "story": [
      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",
      "\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,\u201d he said.",
      "For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.",
      "If there are more stubborn spots \u2014 like food stains or sneezy spatters \u2014 dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar.",
      "Computer maker Lenovo says the \u201cgentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.\u201d Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.",
      "A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup.",
      "If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth.",
      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",
      "Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water \u2014 typically used as a facial cleanser.",
      "Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours.",
      "To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them.",
      "Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup.",
      "They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with.",
      "Both companies say it\u2019s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide.",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago. The action is unfolding in a location comparable to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter containing the leftover building blocks of our solar system\u2019s planets.",
      "The condensing of hot minerals was never detected before around other young stars, \u201cso we didn\u2019t know if it was a universal feature of planet formation or a weird feature of our solar system,\u201d McClure said in an email. \u201cOur study shows that it could be a common process during the earliest stage of planet formation.\u201d",
      "While other research has looked at younger gas disks and, more commonly, mature disks with potential planet wannabes, there\u2019s been no specific evidence for the start of planet formation until now, McClure said.",
      "In a stunning picture taken by the ESO's Alma telescope network, the emerging planetary system resembles a lightning bug glowing against the black void.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many planets might form around HOPS-315. With a gas disk as massive as the sun\u2019s might have been, it could also wind up with eight planets a million or more years from now, according to McClure.",
      "Purdue University\u2019s Merel van \u2019t Hoff, a co-author, is eager to find more budding planetary systems. By casting a wider net, astronomers can look for similarities and determine which processes might be crucial to forming Earth-like worlds.",

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says export controls on advanced chips require companies to adapt",
      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
      "Hunting with a sponge on their face interferes with bottlenose dolphins\u2019 finely tuned sense of echolocation, of emitting sounds and listening for echoes to navigate.",
      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",
      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "That difficulty may explain why it's rare \u2014 with only about 5% of the dolphin population studied by the researchers in Shark Bay doing it. That\u2019s about 30 dolphins total, said Jacobs.",
      "\u201cIt takes them many years to learn this special hunting skill \u2014 not everybody sticks with it,\u201d said marine ecologist Boris Worm at Dalhousie University in Canada, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Dolphin calves usually spend around three or four years with their mothers, observing and learning crucial life skills.",
      "The delicate art of sponge hunting is \u201conly ever passed down from mother to offspring,\u201d said co-author and Georgetown marine biologist Janet Mann.",

      "ATLANTA -- Tarik Skubal views the strike zone differently than robot umpires.",
      "\u201cI have this thing where I think everything is a strike until the umpire calls it a ball,\u201d Detroit's AL Cy Young Award winner said ahead of his start for the American League in Tuesday night's All-Star Game.",
      "MLB has been experimenting with the automated ball-strike system in the minor leagues since 2019 and will use it in an All-Star Game for the first time this summer. Each team gets two challenges and retains the challenge if it is successful.",
      "\u201cPitchers think everything is a strike. Then you go back and look at it, and it\u2019s two, three balls off,\u201d Pittsburgh's Paul Skenes, starting his second straight All-Star Game for the National League, said Monday. \u201cWe should not be the ones that are challenging it.\u201d",
      "MLB sets the top of the automated strike zone at 53.5% of a batter's height and the bottom at 27%, basing the decision on the midpoint of the plate, 8 1/2 inches from the front and 8 1/2 inches from the back. That contrasts with the rule book zone called by umpires, which says the zone is a cube.",
      "\u201cI did a few rehabs starts with it. I\u2019m OK with it. I think it works,\u201d said three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers. \u201cAaron Judge and Jose Altuve should have different sized boxes. They've obviously thought about that. As long as that gets figured out, I think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred anticipates the system will be considered by the sport's 11-man competition committee, which includes six management representatives.",
      "Many pitchers have gravitated to letting their catchers and managers trigger ball/strike appeals. Teams won 52.2% of their challenges during the spring training test. Batters won exactly 50% of their 596 challenges and the defense 54%, with catchers successful 56% of the time and pitchers 41%.",
      "Hall of Famer Joe Torre, an honorary AL coach, favors the system. After his managing career, he worked for MLB and helped supervised expanded video review in 2014.",
      "\u201cYou couldn\u2019t ignore it with all the technology out there,\u201d he said. \"You couldn't sit and make an excuse for, 'Look at what really happened' the next day.\u201d",
      "Now 84, Torre recalled how his Yankees teams benefitted at least twice from blown calls in the postseason, including one involving the strike zone.",
      "With the 1998 World Series opener tied and the bases loaded with two outs in the seventh inning, Tino Martinez took a 2-2 pitch from San Diego's Mark Langston that appeared to be a strike but was called a ball by Richie Garcia. Martinez hit a grand slam on the next pitch for a 9-5 lead, and the Yankees went on to a four-game sweep.",
      "Asked whether he was happy there was no robot umpire then, Torre grinned and said: \u201cPossibly.\u201d",
      "Then he added without a prompt: \u201cWell, not to mention the home run that Jeter hit.\"",
      "His reference was to Derek Jeter's home run in the 1996 AL Championship Series opener, when 12-year-old fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the wall to snatch the ball above the glove over Baltimore right fielder Tony Tarasco.",

A 1965 blind date after Mario got out of the Navy led to seven children, 24 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren, careers and moves. However, memories made over a lifetime together have become increasingly elusive over the past several years, since about the time Mario started to get lost driving and forget whether he likes a particular food.",
      "At a recent memory cafe, the Cirasundas, from suburban Buffalo, and others spent the morning walking through the museum that was inspired by \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d star Lucille Ball in her hometown of Jamestown.",
      "Gail kept a guiding hand on her husband's elbow as they smiled through Johnny Carson bits from \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in the center's late night studio, browsed standup comic George Carlin's personal notes and comedian Bob Hope artifacts, and laughed out loud at a display of classic comedy props like the banana peel and pie in the face.",
      "During a break in the museum's restaurant, the \u201cFamily Ties\u201d video evoked scenes from real life.",
      "\u201cThe moments are precious because he might not remember it,\u201d Gail explained, \u201cbut when you\u2019re there talking about it, you\u2019re remembering. Five minutes later, it\u2019s gone \u2014 but you had that moment.\u201d",
      "The Alzheimer\u2019s Association estimates 7.2 million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, and an even higher number of people care for an impacted friend or family member.",
      "Memory cafes have emerged around the world in recent years as a way to connect and support individuals and caregivers, and provide information and resources. Many of the more than 600 cafes regularly running in the U.S. \u2014 often meeting in libraries and community centers \u2014 bring in speakers and engage participants with physical activity, music and art, all of which are good for the brain, experts say.",
      "The National Comedy Center held its first one earlier this year. It seemed a natural fit after staff heard from patrons about the museum's impact on their loved ones.",
      "Spokesman Gary Hahn sees the center as a kind of time machine, with exhibits memorializing comedy from Vaudeville to viral memes that can transport visitors back, no matter their age. Even before the formal memory cafes began, a visitor told the center's staff that his wife with dementia seldom spoke \u2014 but would become more verbal while walking through the museum and laughing alongside him.",
      "\u201cThere was a stimulation of the part of the brain, whether it\u2019s because of the nostalgia or the comedy, that had an impact on her,\u201d said Journey Gunderson, the center's executive director.",
      "Shelia Kennison, an author and psychology professor at Oklahoma State University, said humor positively affects physiology in many ways.",
      "\u201cIt takes most of your brain to process what\u2019s being said or being shown to you and then to find the humor, and then once that happens, it sets off this cascade of brain activity and physiological changes that affects the whole body,\" said Kennison, who studies how humor is involved in cognition, memory and overall wellbeing. \"So it really is a whole brain workout and a whole body workout when you get that really funny joke that makes you laugh and slap your knee and rock back and forth.\u201d",
      "Laughter has always been important to Gail and Mario Cirasunda, whose children often gave their father Peter Sellers' \u201cPink Panther\u201d movies as gifts so they could see him laugh.",
      "\u201cKeep a sense of humor in your marriage,\u201d Gail's boss told her before she got married. Even through the challenges, she said, she's followed the advice.",

      "Officials in a Texas hill country community pummeled by deadly flooding on July 4 say just three people remain missing, down from nearly 100",
      "KERRVILLE, Texas -- Officials in a Texas hill country community pummeled by deadly flooding July 4 said Saturday that just three people remain missing, down from nearly 100, after people who had previously been reported missing have since been accounted for.",
      "The reduction in the number of people on the missing list came as the search for victims entered its third week. It was a significant drop from the more than 160 people officials previously said were unaccounted for in Kerr County alone.",
      "\u201cThis remarkable progress reflects countless hours of coordinated search and rescue operations, careful investigative work, and an unwavering commitment to bringing clarity and hope to families during an unimaginably difficult time,\u201d Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice in a statement.",
      "The death toll in Kerr County, 107, held steady for much of this week even as the intensive search continued.",
      "The Flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas over the holiday weekend, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.",
      "Just before daybreak on July 4, the destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe, washing away homes and vehicles.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country, a popular tourist destination where campers seek out spots along the river amid the rolling landscape. It is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, including Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls. Located in a low-lying area of a region known as \u201cflash flood alley,\u201d Camp Mystic lost at least 27 campers and counselors.",
      "The flooding was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, experts said, and it moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.",
      "In Kerrville, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Austin, local officials have come under scrutiny over whether residents were adequately warned about the rising waters.",
      "President Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding.",
      "Crews have been searching for victims using helicopters, boats and drones. Earlier efforts were hampered by rain forecasts, leading some crews to hold off or stop because of worries about more flooding.",

      "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs toured the destruction left by a wildfire along the Grand Canyon's North Rim, on Saturday, surveying what she described as devastating damage.",
      "The governor, who has called for an investigation into how the blaze was handled, sought to gather information ahead of meetings with federal officials next week, looked intently out the window as the Black Hawk helicopter she was riding snaked over the Grand Canyon.",
      "White smoke emerged from the North Rim, and most of the Grand Canyon Lodge was reduced to a bare skeleton, though some of the building appeared intact from overhead. Some surrounding trees were no more than charred toothpicks on the ashen land, and whiffs of smoky air passed through the helicopter.",
      "The wildfire was sparked by a lightning strike July 4. Four days later the National Park Service said it was being allowed to burn as part of a \u201cconfine and contain\u201d strategy that the Grand Canyon National Park has leaned on for decades to clear dense vegetation, minimize future risk and make the ecosystem more resilient.",
      "But a week after ignition, blustery winds, hot temperatures and lower humidity quickly intensified the flames, prompting officials to shift to aggressive suppression and order evacuations. The blaze has charred more than 18 square miles (46 square kilometers), and as of Saturday it was 8% contained, according to fire information officer Stefan La-Sky.",
      "No injuries have been reported, but the Dragon Bravo fire on the canyon\u2019s less-frequented North Rim destroyed more than 70 structures, including a visitors' center, historic cabins and the nearly century-old Grand Canyon Lodge.",
      "After touching ground, Hobbs visited the incident command post. Lined with trailers and dotted with yurts and tents, the fire camp currently houses more than 800 personnel who have come from various federal, state and local entities and independent contractors to help fire suppression efforts. The camp functions similar to a tiny town.",
      "The governor shook hands with members of the crew in the mess hall and met with officials including those from Grand Canyon National Park, the Department of Interior and the National Park Service as well as the incident commander. She said she was encouraged to hear that mitigation is a priority for the federal government.",
      "\u201cThis is federal jurisdiction, but fire doesn\u2019t know that boundary, and we all have to work together,\u201d Hobbs said.",
      "The governor has called for an investigation into why the park service did not immediately put out the flames during the hottest and driest period of summer. Members of the state's congressional delegation also have raised questions.",
      "Hobbs said she is not second-guessing the initial response. She said after the fire is managed, she is seeking answers to what went into the decision-making and whether there were missteps.",
      "The park service has defended its actions.",
      "Hobbs is set to meet this week with leadership in the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior about their decisions in managing the wildfire this upcoming week.",
      "She said in a video statement Wednesday that she has not seen any indication that a lack of federal resources are to blame for the spread of the blaze.",
      "Last month President Donald Trump ordered government officials to consolidate wildland firefighting into a single program, despite warnings from former federal officials that it could be costly and increase the risk of catastrophic blazes.",
      "The North Rim is closed for the rest of the season along with a pair of campgrounds near the Colorado River at the bottom of the canyon.",

      "The Trump administration imposed new restrictions Saturday on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a longstanding partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico in response to limits the Mexican government placed on passenger and cargo flights into Mexico City several years ago.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Mexico's actions to force airlines to move out of the main Benito Juarez International Airport to the newer Felipe Angeles International Airport more than 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) away violated a trade agreement between the two countries and gave domestic airlines an unfair advantage. Mexico is the top foreign destination for Americans with more than 40 million passengers flying there last year.",
      "\"Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg deliberately allowed Mexico to break our bilateral aviation agreement,\u201d Duffy said, referring to the previous president and his transportation secretary. \u201cThat ends today. Let these actions serve as a warning to any country who thinks it can take advantage of the U.S., our carriers, and our market. America First means fighting for the fundamental principle of fairness.\u201d",
      "All Mexican passenger, cargo and charter airlines will now be required to submit their schedules to the Transportation Department and seek government approval of their flights until Duffy is satisfied with the way Mexico is treating U.S. airlines.",
      "It's not immediately clear how Duffy's actions might affect the broader trade war with Mexico and negotiations over tariffs. A spokesperson for Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum didn\u2019t reply immediately to a request for comment. Sheinbaum didn\u2019t mention the new restrictions during either of her two speaking events on Saturday.",
      "Delta and Aeromexico have been fighting the Transportation Department's efforts to end their partnership that began in 2016 since early last year. The airlines have argued that it's not fair to punish them for the Mexican government's actions, and they said ending their agreement would jeopardize nearly two dozen routes and $800 million in benefits to both countries' economies that come from tourism spending and jobs.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s tentative proposal to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro-competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as U.S. jobs, communities, and transborder competition,\" Delta said in a statement.",
      "Aeromexico\u2019s press office said it was reviewing the order and intended to present a joint response with Delta in the coming days.",
      "But the order terminating approval of the agreement between the airlines wouldn't take effect until October, and the airlines are likely to continue fighting that decision.",
      "The airlines said in a previous filing fighting the order that it believes the loss of direct flights would prompt over 140,000 American tourists and nearly 90,000 Mexican tourists not to visit the other country and hurt the economies of both countries with the loss of their spending.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Moving at the \u201cspeed of Trump\u201d is one of the White House's favorite phrases, meant to convey the administration's attempts to bring big changes to government at breakneck speed. But when it comes to presidential travel, Donald Trump's pace in the opening months of his second term is comparable to Joe Biden's.",
      "At his six-month mark in office through Saturday, Trump had made 49 trips to 14 states and seven foreign countries, with a heavy focus on weekend golf trips and sporting events.",
      "That's not far off from Biden, who made 45 trips to 17 states and three foreign countries in his first six months in 2021, which overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Democrat made lots of weekend trips home to Delaware, where he went to church and usually did not golf. He also had more political and official trips than did his Republican successor.",
      "Trump\u2019s second-term travel is also less prolific than his first so far, at least in terms of visiting different parts of the United States. In 2017, he made 48 trips to 21 states and eight foreign countries between Jan. 20 and July 20.",
      "The White House has said Trump is most effective while in the Oval Office, working the phones, signing executive orders and meeting with foreign leaders and U.S. elected officials.",
      "It says Trump has met with 25 foreign leaders at the White House, including multiple visits by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and signed 165 executive orders while holding six Cabinet meetings \u2014 totals that far outpace Biden's.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement that Trump\u2019s \u201ctravel reflects his America First agenda -\u2013 he is meeting the American people where they are and representing their best interests.\u201d",
      "The president, Rogers said, \u201cwill continue working around the clock to deliver the best deals for the American people from the Oval Office, throughout the country, and around the world.\u201d",
      "A look at where Trump has gone so far:",
      "When Trump hits the road, it's most often to his properties for weekend trips built around golf in Palm Beach, Florida; Bedminster, New Jersey; or Sterling, Virginia, near Washington's Dulles International Airport and close enough to motorcade from the White House.",
      "The president has logged 14 Florida trips, 13 to Virginia and eight to New Jersey. After summer arrived, he has favored Bedminster or day trips to Sterling over steamy Mar-a-Lago in Florida.",
      "Biden headed to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, many weekends early in his term. He sometimes went to a golf club, but attended Mass nearly every weekend.",
      "Biden also traveled often to showcase policy achievements or to promote his initiatives, such as his visit to Smith Flooring in Chester, Pennsylvania, a small business he described as benefiting from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.",
      "Much of Trump's non-golf domestic travel has been built around sporting events. The president went to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and to Florida for the Daytona 500. He attended UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",
      "Trump has held only three major political rallies since returning to the White House.",
      "He marked his first 100 days in office in suburban Detroit, went to Pittsburgh to trumpet an agreement between U.S. Steel and Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel and to Des Moines, Iowa, to kick off the start of America's 250th birthday celebration. The president gave an economy-focused speech at a Las Vegas casino during his second term's opening weekend, and was in to Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside Washington, to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.",
      "In addition to policy-focused travel, Biden did more early political trips. He participated in a CNN town hall in Wisconsin, marked the 11th anniversary of the Obama administration's signature health care law in Columbus, Ohio, and spotlighted his first 100 days in office by addressing a socially distanced, drive-in rally in Atlanta.",
      "Trump gave more commencement addresses, speaking at the University of Alabama and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. Biden spoke at the Coast Guard commencement in Connecticut in his opening months of his term, when COVID-19 limited many such ceremonies.",
      "One area where Trump has outpaced Biden is on travel overseas. He was to Rome for Pope Francis' funeral and had a swing through Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, before going to Canada for the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and a NATO summit in the Netherlands.",
      "Biden did not travel overseas in 2021 until the G7 that June, when he went to the United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland, again at a time when the pandemic was raging.",
      "Trump's second term started out with visits to western North Carolina and Southern California, both hit by natural disasters that occurred while Biden was president. Trump also visited Texas after recent devastating floods.",
      "But Trump did not tour parts of Missouri and Kentucky that were ravaged by tornadoes. He did not travel to areas hit by strong storms that sparked deadly flooding from other parts of Texas and Oklahoma to Indiana and Pennsylvania. He did not see the widespread aftermath of spring tornadoes, including in Mississippi and Arkansas.",
      "Biden made a February 2021 trip to tour storm damage in Houston. He did not travel to all natural disaster sites during his first six months, either, but went to Florida after a building collapse in Surfside killed 98 people.",
      "When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first foreign leader to visit the White House during Trump's second term in early February, the president proclaimed, \u201cI love Israel. I will visit there. And I\u2019ll visit Gaza.\u201d His Middle East swing in May omitted both places.",
      "Trump also suggested that his government-slashing guru Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there, and the president said he might join him. With Musk having left the Trump administration and engaging in a nasty public feud with Trump, that now seems highly unlikely.",
      "The president said recently he would like to visit Africa \u201cat some point.\" He was less committal about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to visit a September summit of countries known as the Quad, made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia.",
      "Trump is heading to Scotland next week and will visit two areas where he has golf properties. He will be in England for an official visit in the fall. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while at the White House in February, presented Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting the president to his country for an unprecedented second state visit.",
      "\u201cThis has never happened before,\u201d Starmer said. Trump accepted the invitation right then.",

      "\u201cThe truck is actively leaking and crews are working to contain the spill,\u201d the governor\u2019s office statement Friday evening said.",

      "Two dams on the Elwha River, which flows out of Olympic National Park into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, were removed more than a decade ago after a long fought battle by the the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.

      "It was not immediately clear what they were doing when the explosion happened in a parking lot at the Biscailuz Training Facility or what caused it. However an early line of investigation is examining whether it may have been a training accident, according to a law enforcement official briefed on the matter who was not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The detectives who died were part of a team that undergoes in-depth training and responds to more than 1,000 calls a year, according to the Sheriff Robert Luna.",
      "Here's what to know about law enforcement agencies' arson and explosives units:",
      "Depending on the agency, they can be responsible for everything from bomb disposal to search and prevention operations to arson investigations, according to Mark Lomax, former executive director of the National Tactical Officers Association and a retired major for the Pennsylvania State Police.",
      "In bomb disposal actions, team members might respond to a package or box that could contain an explosive device and then use tools like robots or X-ray devices to \u201crender it safe,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "If there is an explosion, members could be sent to investigate, including working to determine the types of materials used to make the bomb, he said. They may also help with search and prevention at big events using bomb sniffing dogs and scanners.",
      "On the fire side of the unit, team members could be responsible for arson investigations, including determining the cause of a fire and whether it was natural or intentional, Lomax said.",
      "Whether or not an agency has such a unit would likely depend on the size of the department and its location.",
      "There are thousands of police departments in the U.S., and the majority of them are under 50 people, according to Lomax. Smaller departments might not have sufficient personnel, money or equipment to have their own explosives team.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, depending on location, they may use the county sheriff\u2019s department in certain locations or the state police in other locations,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "The team from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department would likely be deployed to smaller cities in the county to help with such incidents as suspicious packages or even to educate the community about what to look out for.",
      "A certified bomb technician would need to have a certification from the FBI, most likely from its Hazardous Devices School in Huntsville, Alabama, Lomax said.",
      "That training includes threat assessment and puts participants in \u201ctrue-to-life training settings,\u201d according to a video on the FBI's website.",
      "For advanced training, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has a national center at the same location, according to Lomax. There is also regional training.",
      "\u201cIt's very dangerous, and therefore it demands higher, more advanced training, more advanced equipment,\" Lomax said.",
      "For arson investigations, officials may go to the National Fire Academy in Maryland or participate in fire investigations training through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to Lomax. There are also local academies that offer more basic arson investigation courses.",
      "The people on these teams likely were already officers, troopers or deputies and then later took the specialized training, Lomax said.",
      "Explosives training involving actual explosive devices can be very dangerous because there can be many unknowns, according to Lomax.",
      "Everything from the amount of moisture in the air that day to how long the material has been on the shelf could impact an exercise.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many different variables that make that type of training extremely, extremely dangerous and hazardous,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "He referenced a 2022 incident in which five bomb technicians were injured by the detonation of an explosive device during a training exercise in Pennsylvania conducted by the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia field office.",
      "And in 2021, there was a catastrophic explosion in Los Angeles as homemade fireworks were being destroyed by a bomb squad. It injured 17 people and damaged dozens of homes, businesses and vehicles.",

      "Authorities are investigating a Southern California couple after their infant child was taken to a hospital with a traumatic head injury and 21 children were discovered in their custody",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A woman who almost served as a surrogate for a Southern California couple now under investigation by authorities said she backed out after the couple asked her if any of her friends would like to carry a child for them too.",
      "The request as well as conflicting information she was getting left the woman, Esperanza, unnerved and she decided not to sign a surrogacy contract with Silvia Zhang, who offered her $60,000. Esperanza spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name not be used because she has not shared her surrogacy experience publicly.",
      "Zhang, 38, and her husband, Guojun Xuan, 65, are now the target of an investigation by local and federal authorities after their infant child was taken to the hospital with a traumatic head injury in May. Authorities have since taken 21 children from the couple's custody, many of whom were born by surrogate, said Lt. Kollin Cieadlo of the Arcadia Police Department, near Los Angeles.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties for a woman to become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby for the intended person or couple to raise.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3.",
      "Esperanza is one of at least eight women who say they were aggressively pursued by the couple to serve as surrogates. The women, many of whom were first-time surrogates, say they were given misleading or incomplete information about the couple's family situation and intentions. Some, like Esperanza, did not move forward with carrying a child for the couple. Another who did, Kayla Elliott, is now trying to get custody of a baby she birthed in March for the couple.",
      "Arcadia police say the FBI is involved in the investigation over whether the couple misled surrogates around the country. The FBI has not confirmed its investigation. Elliott said she was interviewed by the FBI at the end of May.",
      "Elliott worked through a business called Mark Surrogacy, according to the contract she signed and shared with the AP. California state records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investments LLC registered at the company's Arcadia home until this June. Elliot's contract listed an El Monte address for the company. An AP reporter visited that location Thursday and did not find anyone who recognized the names of the couple or Mark Surrogacy.",
      "Zhang did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for Mark Surrogacy did not respond to emails seeking comment, nor did a fertility clinic involved in the embryo transfer.",
      "In social media posts, other women who say they served as surrogates for Zhang and Xuan outlined suspicious actions including the couple not fulfilling payment obligations and weren't present for the children's births. Many women contacted by the AP did not respond or said they would only speak after securing an attorney.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were arrested in May after a hospital reported that their 2-month-old infant had a traumatic head injury, the result of a nanny at the home violently shaking the baby, according to Arcadia police.",
      "Arcadia police did not file charges at the time, in order to finish a full investigation, Cieadlo said, and detectives were looking into possible child abuse charges and anticipated presenting a case in a few weeks.",
      "The couple told police that they \u201cwanted a large family\" and produced what appeared to be legitimate birth certificates, including some from outside California, that list Zhang as the mother of the children, Cieadlo said. Xuan was listed as the father on at least some of the birth certificates, Cieadlo said.",
      "Esperanza's dealings with Zhang began in 2023. She had posted in a Facebook group for people interested in surrogacy and received a message from Zhang.",
      "Zhang said she and her partner already had an 8-year-old daughter in China but were having fertility issues. Zhang said she was working with a surrogate who was already pregnant but that she wanted \u201ctwins,\" so she was pursuing a second surrogate. But Esperanza said things started to feel amiss after Zhang asked if she had any friends who also wanted to be surrogates.",
      "\u201cShe said that she\u2019s a realtor in Arcadia and that\u2019s how she has a lot of money and was able to afford a lot of surrogates at the time,\u201d Esperanza said.",
      "Esperanza backed out of the surrogacy after the lawyer for the couple abruptly hung up on her while discussing the contract. She said the document said the couple would implant two embryos instead of one and the section requiring background information on the couple was cut out. The couple became angry when she decided not to move forward.",
      "Esperanza showed text messages to the AP that showed Zhang offering $3,000 more if she agreed to keep going, and another $2,000 bonus after a fetal heartbeat is detected.",
      "Elliott gave birth to a baby girl in March. She chose to be a surrogate because she \u201creally wanted to give somebody a family.\u201d",
      "The Texas woman began the process when Mark Surrogacy reached out to her directly on Facebook. She signed a contract listing Xuan and Zhang as the intended parents. The contract said Elliott would receive $65,000 in a series of payments by the end of her 16th gestational week.",
      "Elliott became wary when early in the pregnancy she flew to California to meet the couple and only Xuan showed up. As the process went on, Elliott had almost no direct contact with the Xuan and Zhang, which is uncommon in surrogacy. Most of the messaging was through texts and emails with representatives from the agency, who discouraged her from reaching out to Zhang.",
      "\u201cThe agency was always like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re very busy people,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "When she learned that the couple had at least two other surrogates having babies for them, she was told by the agency \u201cthey just want a big family.\"",
      "Elliott flew to California for the embryo transfer, which was done at Western Fertility Institute in Los Angeles. The clinic declined to comment on the investigation.",
      "Neither parent were there for Elliott's labor or delivery, and only Zhang showed up a few hours after the baby was born. The woman \u201cdidn\u2019t seem very connected with the child ... she kind of barely looked at her,\" Elliott said.",
      "After handing Elliott $2,000 in cash and giving three of her family members in the room $200 each, the woman left with the baby girl.",
      "Now, Elliott wants custody of the girl and says she just hopes all the babies are safe. When the news first broke about the couple, she confronted Zhang on the phone and over text.",
      "In text messages Elliott showed to the AP, Zhang wrote: \u201cAll the babies really important in our life.\u201d",

      "The search for victims of deadly flooding in Texas Hill Country is headed into its third week as officials try to pin down exactly how many people remain missing",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The search for victims of deadly flooding in Texas Hill Country is headed into its third week as officials try to pin down exactly how many people remain missing and lawmakers prepare to discuss authorities' initial response and providing better warning systems.",
      "Flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio. The Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "The Texas Legislature is scheduled to convene Monday for a special session. Gov. Greg Abbott initially called lawmakers back to the Texas State Capitol in Austin for other reasons, but he and legislative leaders have added flooding-related issues to the agenda.",
      "State officials had been saying about 160 people were unaccounted for after the flooding in Kerr County alone, but they now say about 100 remain missing in Kerr and other counties.",
      "Kerr County officials said the number of missing people decreased as victims were recovered, contact was made with people who were found safe, and some reports were found to be unsubstantiated or falsified. Also, they said, the missing list fluctuates as reports come into a hotline.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country. Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, and Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe. At least 27 of its campers and counselors died.",
      "Abbott called the special session hoping legislators would pass a measure to regulate a booming business in THC products after he vetoed a bill that would have banned them. And since the flooding, President Donald Trump has told the Republicans who control state government to redraw congressional districts to help the GOP's chances of retaining a U.S. House majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Abbott said lawmakers would also review authorities' handling of the flooding and consider improving warning systems for Hill Country residents. Kerr County does not have a warning system because state and local agencies missed opportunities over the past decade to finance one.",
      "Trump and Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding. The president called a reporter \u201cevil\u201d for raising such issues and said he thought \u201ceveryone did an incredible job under the circumstances.\u201d Abbott dismissed a question about who was to blame for the deaths as \u201cthe word choice of losers\u201d and used an analogy that began: \u201cEvery football team makes mistakes.\u201d",
      "\"The way winners talk is not to point fingers,\u201d he concluded.",
      "Abbott has designated bills dealing with early warning systems and emergency communications as priorities for the Legislature's special session, scheduled to last 30 days.",
      "The House and Senate have formed special committees on flooding and disaster preparedness, and they're planning a July 31 visit to Kerrville, the seat of hardest-hit Kerr County, to hear comments from residents.",
      "The committees are scheduled to begin with a joint hearing Wednesday to consider the state's response to the fatal floods; planning for floods; infrastructure for managing floods; and communications among first responders.",
      "One bill already introduced by Republican Rep. Don McLaughlin would require the state's top public health official to set building standards for youth camps in 100-year floodplains \u2014 which FEMA defines as a high-risk area with a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "During a recent news conference, Republican state Rep. Drew Darby, a member of the House's committee, said lawmakers cannot bring back flood victims or undo the flooding.",
      "\u201cBut what we can do is learn from it,\" he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Andry Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, a makeup artist from Venezuela who was deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration and held in a notorious mega-prison, was among the scores of migrants sent back to Venezuela in a three-nation exchange Friday, a California congressman said.",
      "Rep.

We are grateful he is alive and are engaged with both the State Department and his team.\u201d",
      "Romero, a gay man, fled Venezuela last summer and sought asylum in the U.S. He used a U.S. Customs and Border Protection phone app to arrange an appointment at a U.S. border crossing in San Diego.",
      "That\u2019s where he was asked about his tattoos. U.S. immigration authorities use a series of \u201cgang identifiers\u201d to help them spot members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",

One is next to the word \u201cMom.\u201d The other next to \u201cDad.\u201d The crowns, according to his lawyer, also pay homage to his hometown\u2019s Christmastime \u201cThree Kings\u201d festival, and to his work in beauty pageants, where crowns are common.",
      "Romero, who insisted he has no ties to Tren, was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody and transferred to a California detention center. He was eventually flown to the Salvadoran mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, amid President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",

    "story": [
      "A judge is ordering state officials to turn off a death-row inmate's heart-regulating implanted device to avert the risk that it might try to shock him during his execution by lethal injection scheduled for Aug. 5",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee officials must deactivate a death-row inmate 's implanted heart-regulating device to avert the risk that it might try to shock him during his lethal injection, a judge ruled Friday.",
      "The order by Nashville Chancellor Russell Perkins comes ahead of the Aug. 5 execution of Byron Black. Black's attorneys have said that the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator could shock him in an attempt to restore his heart's normal rhythm after the single dose of pentobarbital, with the potential for multiple rounds of shocks and extreme pain and suffering.",
      "The order requires the state to deactivate the device moments before administering the lethal injection, including having medical or certified technician professionals, plus equipment, on hand. The lower-court judge said the order will not serve to delay the execution, something he said he does not have the authority to do. He also said it doesn't add an undue administrative or logistical burden for the state.",
      "Black\u2019s attorneys say the only surefire way to shut off the device is for a doctor to place a programming device over the implant site, sending it a deactivation command. It is unclear how quickly the state could find a medical professional willing to do the deactivation. Additionally, the state is almost certain to file a quick appeal.",
      "The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is a small, battery-powered electronic instrument that is surgically implanted in someone's chest, usually near the left collarbone. Black's was inserted in May 2024. It serves as a pacemaker and an emergency defibrillator. At a two-day hearing this week, experts offered clashing testimony on how it would act during the execution and what Black could feel if he is shocked.",
      "Attorneys for the state deemed it highly unlikely that the pentobarbital would trigger the device's defibrillating function, and if it did, they say he would be unconscious and unaware, and unable to perceive pain. The state also said the lower-court judge lacked authority to order the device disabled.",
      "Black's attorneys say the state is relying on studies that confuse unawareness with unresponsiveness. The inmate's team says research shows pentobarbital renders people unresponsive and causes them to experience amnesia after they undergo an operation, but it doesn\u2019t make them unaware or unable to feel pain..",
      "Kelley Henry, an attorney for Black, said she is relieved by the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrifying to think about this frail old man being shocked over and over as the device attempts to restore his heart\u2019s rhythm even as the State works to kill him,\u201d Henry said in a statement. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling averts that torturous outcome.\u201d",
      "A Tennessee attorney general's office spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday evening. Its previous filings say Black is trying to further delay justice for brutal murders.",
      "Black was convicted in the 1988 shooting deaths of girlfriend Angela Clay, 29, and her two daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakeisha, 6. Prosecutors said Black was in a jealous rage when he shot the three at their home. At the time, Black was on work-release while serving time for shooting and wounding Clay\u2019s estranged husband.",
      "Black has already seen three execution dates come and go, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and a pause on executions from Gov. Bill Lee after the Department of Correction was found to not be testing the execution drugs for potency and purity as required. Black's execution would be the second one under a pentobarbital protocol released in December.",
      "Black\u2019s attorneys have previously tried and failed to show that he should not be executed because he is intellectually disabled, and that would violate the state\u2019s Constitution.",
      "The state Supreme Court recently declined to order a hearing over whether he is incompetent to be executed. A U.S. Supreme Court effort remains pending.",
      "Black's legal team has filed a request for the governor to commute his sentence to life in prison. The letter asking for clemency says Black suffered from prenatal alcohol exposure and exposure to toxic lead as a toddler, compounding lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments.",
      "The 69-year-old is now in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, the clemency letter says.",
      "Additionally, the clemency request says if he had delayed filing his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law.",
      "Black's motion related to his heart device came within a general challenge he and other death row inmates filed against the state\u2019s new execution protocol. The trial isn't until 2026.",

      "The former aide, Brittany Commisso, had sued Cuomo and the state, alleging sexual harassment from the then-governor and retaliation against her after reporting the incidents. The allegations were part of a barrage similar misconduct claims that forced Cuomo to resign as governor in 2021.",
      "Commisso's lawyers said the settlement \u201cis a complete vindication of her claims\u201d and that Commisso is \"glad to be able to move forward with her life.\"",
      "The settlement came as Cuomo is in the midst of a so-far bruising political comeback with a run for mayor of New York City. Cuomo lost the Democratic primary to Zohran Mamdani by more than 12 percentage points and this week relaunched his campaign to run in the general election as an independent candidate, beginning a potentially uphill battle in a heavily Democratic city where support is coalescing behind Mamdani.",
      "Cuomo, who has denied wrongdoing, has been dogged by the scandal during his campaign for mayor.",

      "\u201cUntil the truth is revealed, the lawsuit should not be dismissed,\u201d they said in the statement.",
      "Cuomo resigned as governor after a report from the state attorney general determined that he had sexually harassed at least 11 women, with some alleging unwanted kissing and touching, as well as remarks about their appearances and sex lives.",
      "Commisso filed her lawsuit in late 2023, just before the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a special law that created a yearlong suspension of the usual time limit to sue over an alleged sexual assault.",
      "She later filed a criminal complaint accusing Cuomo of groping her but a local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing lack of sufficient evidence.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they decide to tell their stories publicly, as Commisso has done.",
      "Anthony Hogrebe, a spokesperson for current Gov. Kathy Hochul, said Friday that the state \"is pleased to have settled this matter in a way that allows us to minimize further costs to taxpayers.\u201d",

      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa\u2019s attorney general on Friday said she will withdraw her lawsuit accusing a sheriff of discouraging compliance with federal immigration law, ending a monthslong public dispute between the two Republicans days after the sheriff's northeast Iowa constituents rallied in his defense.",
      "Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Winneshiek County Dan Marx in March over his Facebook post saying his department doesn't always need to detain people at the request of federal immigration authorities. Bird sued even though Marx deleted the post and an investigation from her office showed that Marx fully complied with each of the nearly two dozen requests he had received from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold someone suspected of immigration violations.",
      "Marx had declined to post a conciliatory message the attorney general's office had scripted.",
      "Bird alleged the original post violated state law by impeding and discouraging cooperation with federal immigration officers. The lawsuit jeopardized state funding to the county.",
      "As President Donald Trump took office and initiated his campaign of mass deportations, Marx told constituents on Feb. 4 that he shares some of their \u201cmistrust and many of your concerns with the legitimacy of how these federal agents conduct business\u201d and that requests to hold individuals without a court order are \u201cviolations\u201d of constitutional rights.",
      "At the same time, there was a legislative push in states across the country to support Trump\u2019s immigration efforts and curtail \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d that generally limit cooperation with immigration authorities. The Trump administration had also begun taking legal action against governments that have adopted policies inhibiting ICE arrests and deportations.",
      "Marx said in a statement Friday that he met with Bird in person and explained it was \u201cnever my intent to discourage immigration enforcement.\u201d Marx also thanked his constituents for their patience and \u201coutpouring of support through this situation,\u201d he said.",
      "When Bird visited the county Monday, dozens of people showed up to support Marx and criticize the lawsuit as a bullying tactic, television station KGAN reported.",
      "Bird said Friday she intended to dismiss the case because the county has \u201cnow fully complied.\u201d",
      "\u201cWinneshiek County and Sheriff Marx are in compliance with 27A,\" she said in a statement, referencing the chapter in Iowa code that ensures cities and counties fully comply with federal immigration law. \"They have committed to continue to honor ICE detainers and cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\u201d",
      "Marx\u2019s February post echoed critiques of what are known as ICE \u201cdetainer\u201d requests that ask local or state law enforcement agencies to hold individuals until they can be taken into custody by federal authorities. Marx said those requests often clash with the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which bars against unreasonable searches and seizures of individuals without a warrant based on probable cause.",
      "If federal agents\u2019 \u201cactions or paperwork are not within constitutional parameters,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthen we will make every effort to block, interfere and interrupt their actions from moving forward.\u201d",

Taylor, 46, was inside one of the tents and was crushed by the truck when his tent was flattened, the lawsuit says.",
      "City officials had called for the clearing of the encampment in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

      "The lawsuit filed in Fulton County State Court asks for a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages, as well as repayment for medical expenses, funeral costs and legal fees. It was filed against the city and seven unnamed city employees, including the driver of the bulldozer.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last year that cities across the country can enforce bans on homeless camping. But clearings are controversial.",
      "Taylor\u2019s death sparked outrage among local advocates and neighbors at the encampment, who called the city\u2019s policies on clearing encampments deeply inhumane. They said the city faces a dire affordable housing shortage that makes it inevitable that people will end up living on the streets. The family's lawyers described the lawsuit as a call for city leaders to treat homeless people as deserving of \u201crespect and dignity\u201d instead of rushing to clear their communities \u201cas if they were invisible.\u201d",
      "City officials have said they are doing that. Right after Taylor's death, the city put a temporary moratorium on encampment sweeps. With the FIFA World Cup coming to Atlanta next year, the city has since resumed clearing encampments with the controversial goal of eliminating all homelessness in the downtown area before then.",
      "Last week, the city closed the camp where Taylor lived and said officials coordinated with the local nonprofit who leads the city\u2019s homelessness services to offer people living there housing with supportive services.",
      "Lawyers said they were grateful for the city's efforts, but more work is needed. Members of the Justice for Cornelius Taylor Coalition said they are still paying for hotel rooms for eight former encampment residents. Taylor's lawyers and family called on Mayor Andre Dickens' administration cut through red tape such as issues with documents and help the others get housing.",
      "A spokesperson for the city did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday afternoon.",
      "Taylor's sister Darlene Chaney teared up during a Friday news conference where lawyers announced the lawsuit as she re-listened to descriptions of the gruesome injuries her brother suffered.",
      "She said Taylor loved to read everything from science fiction to the Bible. He was eager to leave the encampment to rebuild his life, and stayed positive about his future even as barriers such as getting him an ID slowed that process down, she said. She misses his \u201cannoying\u201d weekly calls \u2014 and said now she only has one brother to annoy her. She misses having two.",
      "\u201cWe're here, just because someone, in my own personal opinion, was lazy,\u201d Chaney said.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 21:07:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Felix Baumgartner made global headlines in 2012 when he jumped from the stratosphere and parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "story": [
      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "British-born restaurateur Keith McNally was responsible for the opening of such popular New York City institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led him to attempt suicide two years later.",
      "He's recounted his story in the irreverent memoir\u00a0\"I Regret Almost Everything: A Memoir\"\u00a0(Simon & Schuster).",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Keith McNally on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",
      "\"I Regret Almost Everything\" by Keith McNally",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "There was a time when everything worked. ...\u00a0 I'd been happily married and the owner of eight successful Manhattan restaurants, including Balthazar in SoHo. In 2004, the New York Times had called me \"The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.\" I had everything going for me. And then on November 26, 2016, the clock stopped.",
      "I was living in London. One Saturday morning I coaxed my youngest children, George and Alice, into seeing a Caravaggio exhibition with me at the National Gallery. George was thirteen, Alice eleven. While looking at a painting of Jesus being betrayed by Judas, The Taking of Christ, I sensed my body beginning to show signs of betraying me: a strange metallic tingling started to pinch my fingertips. It was an odd feeling, but as it stopped after five or six seconds, I didn't give it another thought. Soon afterward, to the relief of my children, we left the museum.",
      "Two hours later, when I was back home by myself, the metallic feeling returned. Only this time it was in earnest. Within seconds the horrific tingling shot up my left arm and, like some malignant jellyfish, clasped itself onto my face. Terrified, I phoned Alina, who rushed back with the kids and instantly called an ambulance. George, fists clenched, was panic-stricken as medics examined my convulsing body. Within minutes I was being hoisted into the waiting ambulance. Alina, George and Alice looked on.",
      "I woke up several hours later in Charing Cross Hospital. The first thing the doctor told me was that I'd had a stroke. The second thing was that my brain would never be the same again. Perhaps his bluntness was necessary for legal reasons, but from where I stood\u2014or lay\u2014it was a brutal awakening.",
      "After the doctor left, I tried wriggling my arms and legs to check that I wasn't paralyzed. I wasn't, thank God. To test my memory, I wrote the alphabet on the back of the nurse's chart. I then tried saying the letters aloud, but here there was a problem. The words wouldn't conform to my efforts. They exited my mouth in such a slurred and disorderly way that I sounded like a stage drunk. But this was a small price to pay for my stroke. My first stroke, that is. Because the next day the artillery arrived and gave me such a hammering that in one fell swoop I lost the use of my right hand, right arm and right leg. And my slurred speech, perhaps in fright, went AWOL. Overnight I was confined to a wheelchair and deprived of language.",
      "So much for The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.",
      "* * *",
      "I shared a ward with five other men whose ages ranged from forty to eighty. At night, with words inaccessible to me, I'd listen in awe to them talking. Speech suddenly seemed like a divine accomplishment. Even everyday words had an element of poetry to them.",
      "I dreaded the moment when the men would stop talking and I'd be left with my own thoughts. Sleepless, half-paralyzed and unable to speak, I felt buried alive. More than anything, I wished the stroke had killed me.",
      "Bereft of speech and right side unusable, I wondered how my relationship with Alina might change. And with George and Alice also. All children exaggerate their father's strength. Most sense it ebbing away imperceptibly over twenty or so years. Generally, a father's decline appears natural, tolerable even. It wasn't going to be like that for my children.",
      "My new life seemed ungraspable. It existed, but was outside of me.",
      "On my second day in the hospital, Alina arranged for George and Alice to visit. An hour before they were due, I became so ashamed of them seeing me disabled that I canceled the visit. The next day I could hold out no longer.",
      "Hospitals are a great leveler. Like soldiers at war, patients lose all distinctiveness. As they entered the ward, George and Alice failed to recognize me. I was lying at the end of a row of identical beds, assimilating into the world of the sick and dying. Although it had only been three days since I last saw them, they looked years younger. They stood by the door, small eyes darting from one sick man to the next, searching for some identifiable sign of their father. After a few seconds they rushed to my bed.",
      "Alice seemed happy to see me, but George looked angry and said less than usual. He'd behaved in a similar way a year earlier after watching me lose a match in a squash tournament. Back then, I found his anger confusing. Now it made sense.",
      "Alina put on a brave face but was so shell-shocked she said little. I managed to gurgle out a few words, and in between the long silences the heavy breathing of the man in the next bed entered uncomfortably into our space. Alina told the children I was going to regain my voice and would soon be walking out of the hospital.",
      "Neither responded.",
      "When the three of them left, I wept for the first time in twenty years.",

    "story": [
      "Oscar-winning lyricist Alan Bergman, who worked with his wife,\u00a0Marilyn, in a partnership that produced hits such as \"The Way We Were,\" \"It Might Be You\" and \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,\" has died, his family announced. He was 99.",
      "The family's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said the legendary lyricist died late Thursday night at his Los Angeles home with his daughter, writer and film producer Julie Bergman, present.",
      "\"Bergman suffered from respiratory issues in recent months, but continued to write songs till the very end,\" Sunshine said in a statement.",
      "The Bergmans married in 1958 and remained together until Marilyn's\u00a0death in 2022. With collaborators ranging from Marvin Hamlisch and Quincy Jones to Michel Legrand and Cy Coleman, they were among the most successful and prolific partnerships of their time, providing words and occasional music for hundreds of songs, including movie themes that became as famous as the films themselves.",
      "Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett and many other artists performed their material, and Barbra Streisand became a frequent collaborator and close friend.",
      "Blending Tin Pan Alley sentiment and contemporary pop, the Bergmans crafted lyrics known by millions, many of whom would not have recognized the writers had they walked right past them. Among their most famous works: the Streisand-Neil Diamond duet \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers,\" the well-named Sinatra favorite \"Nice 'n' Easy\" and the topical themes to the 1970s sitcoms \"Maude\" and \"Good Times.\"",
      "Their film compositions included Ray Charles' \"In the Heat of the Night\" from the movie of the same name, Noel Harrison's \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" from \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" and Stephen Bishop's \"It Might Be You\" from \"Tootsie.\"",
      "The whole world seemed to sing and cry along to \"The Way We Were,\" an instant favorite recorded by Streisand for the 1973 romantic drama of the same name that co-starred Streisand and Robert Redford. Set to Hamlisch's tender, bittersweet melody, it was essentially a song about itself \u2014 a nostalgic ballad about nostalgia, an indelible ode to the uncertainty of the past, starting with one of history's most famous opening stanzas: \"Memories / light the corners of my mind / misty watercolor memories / of the way we were.\"",
      "\"The Way We Were\" was the top-selling song of 1974 and brought the Bergmans one of their three Oscars, the others coming for \"Windmills of Your Mind\" and the soundtrack to \"Yentl,\" the Streisand-directed movie from 1983. At times, the Academy Awards could be mistaken for a Bergman showcase. In 1983, three of the nominees for best song featured lyrics by the Bergmans, who received 16 nominations in all.",
      "The Bergmans also won two Grammys, four Emmys, were presented numerous lifetime achievement honors and received tributes from individual artists, including Streisand's 2011 album of Bergman songs, \"What Matters Most.\" On \"Lyrically, Alan Bergman,\" Bergman handled the vocals himself. Although best known for their movie work, the Bergmans also wrote the Broadway musical \"Ballroom\" and provided lyrics for the symphony \"Visions of America.\"",
      "Their very lives seemed to rhyme. They didn't meet until they were adults, but were born in the same Brooklyn hospital, four years apart; raised in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, attended the same children's concerts at Carnegie Hall and moved to California in the same year, 1950. They were introduced in Los Angeles while working for the same composer, but at different times of the day. Their actual courtship was in part a story of music. Fred Astaire was Marilyn's favorite singer at the time and Alan Bergman co-wrote a song, \"That Face,\" which Astaire agreed to record. Acetate in hand, Bergman rushed home to tell Marilyn the news, then proposed.",
      "Bergman had wanted to be a songwriter since he was a boy. He majored in music and theater at the University of North Carolina and received a master's from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he befriended Johnny Mercer and became a protege. He and Marilyn at first wrote children's songs together, and broke through commercially in the late 1950s with the calypso hit \"Yellowbird.\" Their friendship with Streisand began soon after, when they visited her backstage during one of her early New York club appearances. \"Do you know how wonderful you are?\" was how Marilyn Bergman greeted the young singer.",
      "The Bergmans worked so closely together that they often found themselves coming up with the same word at the same time. Alan likened their partnership to housework: one washes, one dries, the title of a song they eventually devised for a Hamlisch melody. Bergman was reluctant to name a favorite song, but cited \"A Love Like Ours\" as among their most personal: \"When love like ours arrives / We guard it with our lives / Whatever goes astray / When a rainy day comes around / A love like ours will keep us safe and sound.\"",

      "Beverly Hills, Calif. \u2014 A whip wielded by Harrison Ford in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\" that once belonged to Princess Diana has sold at auction for $525,000.",
      "Thursday's sale came a day after the Rosebud sled from \"Citizen Kane\" went for a staggering $14.75 million, making it one of the priciest props in movie history.",
      "They were part of the Summer Entertainment Auction being held all week by Heritage Auctions.",
      "Heritage says the overall take has made it the second-highest grossing entertainment auction of all time, and there's still a day to go.",
      "Yet to be up for bids are Macaulay Culkin's knit snow cap from \"Home Alone,\" a Kurt Russell revolver from \"Wyatt Earp,\" a pair of \"Hattori Hanzo\" prop swords from \"Kill Bill Vol. 1\" and a first edition set of Harry Potter novels signed by J.K. Rowling.",
      "The whip sold Thursday was used during the Holy Grail trials that Ford's character goes through at the climax of 1989's \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.\"",
      "Ford gave it to then-Prince Charles at the film's U.K. premiere. It was given as a gift to Princess Diana, who gave it to the current owner, who was not identified. The buyer also was not identified.",
      "\"The bullwhip is the iconic symbol of an iconic character of cinema history, Indiana Jones, and has been a highlight of this auction,\" Joe Maddalena, Heritage's executive vice president, said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The $525,000 price includes the \"buyers premium\" attached to all auction items for the house that sells it.",
      "Heritage said the nearly $15 million bid for the Rosebud sled put it second only to the $32.5 million that Judy Garland's ruby slippers from \"The Wizard of Oz\" fetched in December. Neither of those buyers were identified either.",
      "The sled was sold by longtime owner Joe Dante, director of films including \"Gremlins.\"",
      "\"Rosebud\" is the last word spoken by the title character in director Orson Welles' 1941 film \"Citizen Kane,\" and the hunt for its meaning provides the film's plot. Many critics have regarded it as the best film ever made.",
      "Long thought lost, the sled is one of three of the prop known to have survived. Dante stumbled on it when he was filming on the former RKO Pictures lot in 1984. He wasn't a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",
      "Dante's friend and mentor Steven Spielberg paid $60,500 for another of the sleds in 1982, and anonymous buyer paid $233,000 for the third in 1996.",
      "Editor's note: The headline of this story has been updated to correct the sale price of the whip.",

According to the Themed Entertainment Association, Disneyland drew more than 17 million people in 2023, bouncing back from an unprecedented 13-month closure during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "Today, a one-day ticket starts at more than $100 and on some days can double that.",

    "summary": "Connie Francis was a wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy.",
    "story": [
      "Connie Francis, the wholesome pop star of the 1950s and '60s whose hits include \"Pretty Little Baby\" and whose personal life was filled with heartbreak and tragedy, has died, her friend and publicist, Ron Roberts, announced Thursday. She was 87.",
      "\"It is with a heavy heart and extreme sadness that i inform you of the passing of my dear friend Connie Francis last night,\" Roberts said in a statement posted to Facebook at 1:46 a.m. EDT. \"I know that Connie would approve that her fans are among the first to learn of this sad news.\"",
      "In another post Thursday afternoon, Roberts said Francis died Wednesday in a hospital in Pompano Beach, Florida. She had been hospitalized since late June after experiencing hip pain that led to her using a wheelchair and was later determined to be a pelvic fracture. While Francis was being treated in an intensive care unit, it was confirmed on Tuesday that she had pneumonia, Roberts said.",
      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

      "Police said a witness told them he defied orders to stay out of the room after he heard a patient, his relative, screaming during a scan.",
      "When he entered, the magnetic machine pulled the chain around his neck and caused him to be drawn in as well, police said.",
      "Doctors follow strict MRI safety protocols",
      "MRI machines can be especially dangerous around people with oxygen tanks, in wheelchairs or wearing magnetic jewelry. That's why patients are told to remove all metal and electrical objects before getting scanned, doctors and staff at North Shore University Hospital told CBS News New York.",
      "\"It would act like a torpedo trying to get into the middle of the center of the magnet,\" Charles Winterfeldt, the hospital's director of imaging services, said.",

      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years.

      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",

      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 20:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers face both rising premiums and falling subsidies next year in Obamacare plans.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the 24 million people in Affordable Care Act health plans face a potential one-two punch next year \u2014 double-digit premium increases along with a sharp drop in the federal subsidies that most consumers depend on to buy the coverage, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits \u2014 rising medical and labor costs and usage \u2014 but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, COVID-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.",
      "\"The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won't actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,\" said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Trump and the GOP. Many other changes \u2014 such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid \u2014 won't occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.",
      "\"I am hearing on both sides \u2014 more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate\" \u2014 that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.",
      "In initial filings, insurers nationally are seeking a median rate increase \u2014 meaning half of the proposed increases are lower and half higher \u2014 of 15%, according to an analysis for the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker covering 19 states and the District of Columbia. KFF is a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That's up sharply from the last few years. For the 2025 plan year, for example, KFF found that the median proposed increase was 7%.",
      "Health insurers \"are doing everything in their power to shield consumers from the rising costs of care and the uncertainty in the market driven by recent policy changes,\" wrote Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, the industry's lobbying group. The emailed response also called on lawmakers \"to take action to extend the health care tax credits to prevent skyrocketing cost increases for millions of Americans in 2026.\"",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.",
      "These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.",
      "Still, \"it's the biggest increase we've seen in over five years,\" said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.",
      "Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.",
      "For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% \u2014 if the ACA's enhanced tax credits are extended.",
      "Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs \u2014 including the use of expensive obesity drugs \u2014 will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.",
      "But rising premiums are just part of the picture.",
      "A bigger potential change for consumers' pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden's term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.",
      "Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.",
      "Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.",
      "But they're also costly.",
      "A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Such an extension was left out of the policy law Mr. Trump signed on July 4 that he called the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.",
      "That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level \u2014 $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year \u2014 won't get any subsidies at all.",
      "If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.",
      "\"There will be sticker shock,\" said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.",
      "And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law's new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.",
      "According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.",
      "Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.",
      "\"What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase\" in premiums as a result, she said.",
      "Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.",
      "Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.",
      "Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don't extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.",
      "But any such effort will draw pushback.",
      "Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.",
      "But others note that many consumers \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Mr. Trump.",
      "Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.",
      "Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Mr. Trump's new tax law allows people enrolled in either \"bronze\" or \"catastrophic\"-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.",
      "\"Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,\" Brooker said.",

    "summary": "The new tax cuts and spending bill includes a $250 fee for visitors coming to the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Many travelers to the U.S. are now subject to a new $250 \"visa integrity fee,\" part of the tax cuts and spending law signed by President Trump on July 4.",
      "The fee is effective in the current federal fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2024, and ends on Sept. 30, 2025, according to the text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. For subsequent years, the amount will be adjusted for inflation, the law states.",
      "The fee applies to visitors who come to the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, such as foreign students attending American universities or workers who receive temporary work visas such as\u00a0the H-1B, which is often used by companies to hire foreign engineers or other skilled workers.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. issued more than 10 million nonimmigrant visas, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the U.S. State Department.",
      "Visa holders subjected to the fee may later be reimbursed as long as they comply with their visa's restrictions, such as leaving the U.S. within five days of the visa's expiration, according to the new law. However, the law doesn't specify how visa holders may apply for reimbursement of the fee, nor how the fee will be collected.",
      "\"The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore integrity in our nation's immigration system,\" it added.",
      "Given that fee isn't yet set up to be collected, it's unclear whether the visa integrity fee will be retroactive. The Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately respond to a question about whether the fee would be collected retroactively.",
      "Fee for asylum seekers",
      "The new fee will add to the hurdles facing immigrants, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan think tank focused on immigration issues. It noted the new bill also includes additional new charges, including a new $100 fee for people applying for asylum.",
      "\"These fees, many of which are authorized to be layered on top of existing fees, are largely mandatory, effectively putting legal pathways out of reach for thousands of people,\" the group\u00a0said\u00a0in a July 14 statement.",
      "For instance, student visa applicants already must pay an $185 application fee and a $350 fee for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. The additional $250 fee will bring their total cost to $785.",
      "People seeking asylum in the U.S., who previously could apply for that designation for free, could face total filing fees of more than $1,150 under the new law, according to the American Immigration Council.",
      "Many tourists to the U.S. don't require visas due to the\u00a0Visa Waiver Program, which allows residents of more than 40 nations \u2014 ranging from Australia to the U.K. \u2014 to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of taxpayers could see a lower tax bill next year due to the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump, with a recent analysis finding that every income group will see some savings.",
      "On average, taxpayers will save about $2,900 per household in 2026, according to the analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank focused on taxes. But higher-income Americans are more likely to see a bigger relative boost than lower-income households, their analysis found.",
      "The new law extends the tax cuts in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with many of those provisions otherwise slated to expire at year-end. But the legislation also adds a bevy of new tax breaks, ranging from eliminating taxes on overtime and tips to lifting the state and local taxes deduction from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "About $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people who earn incomes of about $217,000 or more, the Tax Policy Center analysis found.",
      "\"Average tax cuts are generally larger as a percentage of after-tax income for higher income households than for lower income households,\" it noted.",
      "For instance, the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments next year, or 0.8% of their income.",
      "But those in the top quintile, or who earn $217,101 or more, will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their incomes, the analysis found.",
      "To be sure, an individual's tax savings next year will depend on a number of variables, such as their number of children, which allows people to claim the Child Tax Credit, or whether they can tap one of the new tax breaks, such as the elimination of taxes on some tipped income.",
      "More than 6 in 10 adults said they believe the new law would do more to help wealthy Americans than other income groups, according to a July 18 poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. About 60% said they expect the law will hurt low-income people, the survey found.",

    "summary": "Bankruptcy filing alleges Steward Health Care executives siphoned $245 million from needy hospitals.",
    "story": [
      "Steward Health Care, an embattled hospital chain that has been the focus of federal scrutiny, has filed new court papers blaming the company's financial woes on its founding chief executive. The company alleges that the ex-CEO and three former colleagues misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars and drove the chain into bankruptcy.",
      "Steward accuses its founder Ralph de la Torre and three others\u00a0 \u2014 Michael Callum, James Karam, and Sanjay Shetty \u2014 of defrauding the company of more than $245 million.",
      "\"Through their greed and bad faith misconduct, [these former insiders] operated Steward with the aim of enriching themselves at the expense of the Company, its creditors, and the patients and communities that Steward served,\" the new filing alleges. \"These insiders pilfered Steward's assets for their own material gain, while leaving the Company and its hospitals perpetually undercapitalized and insolvent.\"",
      "Once the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, Steward operated hospitals in Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania and other states. CBS News found that de la Torre pushed for the company's expansion. By working with a real estate investment firm, Medical Properties Trust, de la Torre helped purchase new medical properties, sell off the real estate, and force the hospitals into costly lease-back arrangements.",
      "A CBS News investigation that spanned nearly two years documented allegations of\u00a0 how private equity investors and de la Torre followed this formula, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends from the real estate sales, while health care workers and patients struggled to get the life-saving supplies they needed as a result.",
      "Records reviewed by CBS News showed Steward hospitals around the country left a trail of unpaid bills, at times risking a shortage of potentially life-saving supplies. That included a case in a Massachusetts hospital where medical staff says a device that could have stopped the bleeding in a new mother's liver was repossessed by the manufacturer weeks earlier. After being transferred to another hospital, the young woman died just hours after giving birth to her first daughter.",
      "Last August, after filing for bankruptcy, the company sold off six Massachusetts hospitals. The sale of the final two facilities in the state left about 1,200 workers jobless, according to state officials. In a 2024 interview with CBS News, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey did not hold back in her assessment of the conduct of Steward executives.",
      "\"I'm disgusted. It's selfish. It's greed,\" she said.",
      "At the time of the patient's death, a spokesperson for Steward told CBS News company executives always put patients first and said they \"deny that any other considerations were placed ahead of that guiding principle.\"",
      "In an earlier statement, the spokesperson said Steward \"has actively and meaningfully invested\" in its hospital system since its formation, including in Massachusetts, where it took over hospitals that were \"failing\" and \"about to close.\"",
      "De la Torre also defended the company's actions.",
      "\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" de la Torre said in a company statement in 2024.",
      "This week's complaint lists three major transactions that de la Torre and executives allegedly profited from while leaving Steward hospitals struggling for funds to operate.",
      "In January 2021, de la Torre allegedly took a $111 million dividend payout while the company was struggling financially. The former CEO also pocketed $81.5 million according to the complaint. The court filing also lists the former executives who benefited: Callum, who as vice president for physician services at Steward received $10.3 million. Shetty, then-president of Steward Health Care System received $1.8 million and Karam, who remains a member of Steward's board, received $728,456.",
      "The complaint also claims Steward Health Care International, the international arm of Steward that's majority-owned by de la Torre, received $4.3 million of the dividend payout.",
      "Later that year, Steward claims de la Torre overpaid by $200 million for five Miami-based hospitals acquired from Tenet Healthcare Corporation. The complaint alleges the former CEO pushed for the $1.1 billion deal based on his \"personal desire to build a hospital empire in the Miami area, rather than on any independent financial analysis.\"",
      "According to the complaint, de la Torre then sold assets related to Steward's Medicare Advantage business to a company called CareMax in 2022.",
      "Steward, through its physicians organization, allegedly received $60.5 million in cash, while the bulk of the proceeds \u2014 almost $134 million in stock of CareMax \u2014 ultimately went to a holding company that was majority-owned by de la Torre, Callum, Shetty and Karam. The complaint alleges de la Torre and named board members \"sold valuable\" assets and \"diverted the proceeds to themselves\" while the company went insolvent.",
      "\"De la Torre, Callum, and Karam were grossly negligent and breached their duties of care, loyalty, and good faith,\" according to the filing.",
      "CareMax filed for bankruptcy in February.",
      "While Steward's hospitals were struggling, CBS News previously reported on de la Torre's lavish personal spending, including the purchase of a $30 million yacht in 2021, a multimillion-dollar Texas horse ranch in 2022, and two corporate jets valued at $95 million.",
      "Steward Health Care is now being run by a court-appointed administrator and is trying to claw back funds from its former leaders to pay off its creditors.",
      "De la Torre, who founded the company in 2010, is at the center of a federal probe focused on potential fraud, embezzlement and violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, sources told CBS News. In 2024, he refused to appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that had been looking into Steward's bankruptcy, despite being issued a subpoena. Senators took the rare step of holding him in contempt for that failure to appear.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 21:15:26 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

    "summary": "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
    "story": [
      "Vaping brand Juul is allowed to keep its electronic cigarettes on the market, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.",
      "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
      "The decision comes after the brand has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend.",
      "The FDA decision applies to both tobacco- and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product, which works with nicotine-filled cartridges sold in two different strengths. Juul previously discontinued several fruit and candy flavors that helped drive its popularity but were favored by teens.",
      "Juul will be one of only two U.S. companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes, which many adults prefer to tobacco flavor.",
      "\"This is an important milestone for the company and I think we made a scientifically sound case for the role that menthol can play in e-vapor,\" Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite told The Associated Press.",
      "Critic calls decision \"a big step in the wrong direction\"",
      "Parents, politicians and anti-tobacco groups are certain to oppose the FDA's decision. They have argued for years that Juul products should be permanently banned due to their role in triggering a yearslong spike in underage vaping.",
      "\"It is a big step in the wrong direction to authorize sales of the product that was responsible for this public health crisis in the first place,\" Yolonda Richardson, CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement.",
      "Juul was once valued at more than $13 billion, and its small, sleek e-cigarettes revolutionized the image and technology of the vaping industry. But the company has since been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the rise of youth vaping.",
      "The FDA had ordered the company to remove its products from the market in June 2022. But then the agency abruptly reversed course days later and agreed to reopen its scientific review of Juul's application after the company pushed back in court.",
      "At the time, the FDA had raised concerns over \"potentially harmful chemicals\" in Juul's e-cigarettes and \"insufficient and conflicting data\" it said the company had submitted.",
      "Juul said regulators had overlooked thousands of pages of scientific data critical to its submission.",
      "Authorized, not endorsed by the FDA",
      "Thursday's announcement is not an approval or endorsement, and the FDA reiterated that people who do not smoke should not use Juul or any other e-cigarettes. The FDA determination indicates that smokers who switch completely to Juul can reduce their exposure to deadly carcinogens and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.",
      "The FDA decision applies to Juul's original system, which is now roughly a decade old. Crosthwaite said the company hopes to win authorization for its next-generation device and is also considering applying to the FDA for more flavors.",
      "\"It's critically important that American adults who use tobacco have regulated options,\" Crosthwaite said.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers cut back on cigarettes. Juul's main competitors, Vuse and Njoy, each previously received FDA permission to remain on the market. Njoy sells the only other menthol-flavored e-cigarettes authorized by the FDA.",
      "To meet FDA requirements, companies must show that their products benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use them are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.",
      "Juul's journey, from launch to lawsuits",
      "The brainchild of two Stanford University students, Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market.",
      "Juul quickly outpaced older brands with its high-nicotine, fruity-flavored cartridges, sold in mango, mint and creme brul\u00e9e. The company's small, discrete devices provided a more potent, user-friendly alternative to older, bulkier devices.",
      "But the company's rise was fueled by underage use, and e-cigarettes quickly became ubiquitous in U.S. schools. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating most of its flavors, leaving only tobacco and menthol-flavored options.",
      "By then, the company was already the target of multiple investigations and lawsuits by federal, state and local officials, as well as class-action attorneys.",
      "In 2022, the company paid $1.7 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by families of Juul users, school districts, city governments and Native American tribes. The company separately agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits or investigations from most U.S. states.",
      "Juul is no longer the top-selling e-cigarette brand and now trails Vuse, which is sold by tobacco giant Reynolds American, which also makes Camel and Newport cigarettes.",
      "Teens have shifted away from Juul amid a wider drop in vaping, according to the latest federal figures. The FDA reported last year that teen vaping dropped to a 10-year low, after stepped-up enforcement against unauthorized brands imported from China, such as Elf Bar.",
      "Unlike Juul, disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar still come in fruit and candy flavors, despite efforts by regulators to block their use.",

Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-official-criticizes-fed-chief-jerome-powell-office-renovations-interest-rates/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "On July 2, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "When asked about the allegation in a recent Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he [Powell] should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 16:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The GENIUS Act is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children.",
      "Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "It's faced similar criticism from House Democrats.",
      "\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\" Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.",
      "Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.",
      "\"The question is, do you want some rules of the road or no rules of the road?\" Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said during floor debate.",
      "The broader market structure bill also passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the Senate. The legislation banning a central bank digital currency was approved largely along party lines.",

    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",

    "story": [
      "The back-to-school season may seem at least a month away on the calendar, but for a majority of American families, it's already begun.",
      "Two-thirds of back-to-school shoppers have already started buying clothing and supplies ahead of the new school year \u2014 a 55% increase on the level of early purchases last year.",
      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year. The increase, however, reflects an increase in the number of consumers shopping for back-to-school supplies, and not individual spending, which is expected to be lower this year.",
      "Families with students in kindergarten through high school plan to spend an average of $858.07 on school-related items this year, down from $874.68 in 2024, according to the study. College students and their parents also plan to spend less this year \u2014 an average of $1,325.85, down from $1,364.75 in 2024.",
      "Four in five shoppers said they were planning their shopping around July back-to-school sales to maximize their budgets, the NRF report found.",
      "Retailers focus on sales",
      "With inflation and tariffs top of mind for many consumers, stores are already promoting back-to-school discounts to lure shoppers.",
      "\"As shoppers look for the best deals on clothes, notebooks and other school-related items, retailers are highly focused on affordability and making the shopping experience as seamless as possible,\" NRF's Cullen said.",
      "Amazon, Target and Walmart\u00a0are each offering back-to-school summer sales to entice customers. Amazon last week completed its four-day Prime Day event, which offered thousands of\u00a0deals on everything from backpacks to dorm furnishings to laptops.",

    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:47:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The tax and spending bill signed into law by President Trump on July 4 includes a limited tax break for car buyers.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of car buyers in the U.S. could soon get some tax relief thanks to a provision in the so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" that was signed into law on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "The idea of giving a tax break for auto purchasers was first floated by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail in October, when he promised that such a measure would \"make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families.\"",
      "That promise has now materialized as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, with the new tax break taking effect for car purchases starting in 2025. But the deduction also has income limitations that narrow the number of Americans who can claim it, while used car buyers and vehicle leasers do not benefit.",
      "Still, car buyers who have bought a new vehicle this year or are planning to do so in the next four years may get some tax relief when they file their 2025 tax returns. The deduction will expire in 2028, which means car buyers can only take advantage of the benefit for four tax years.",
      "At the same time, the One Big Beautiful Act eliminates the federal tax credit for electric vehicles after Sept. 30. The tax break, which provides a $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, is credited with helping make electric vehicles more affordable for many buyers.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How much is the new auto loan deduction?",
      "The new tax cuts and spending law enables car buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in \"qualified passenger vehicle loan interest during a given taxable year,\" beginning with 2025 purchases.",
      "While that's similar to the mortgage interest deduction available to homeowners, there is one major difference: Car buyers will be able to itemize their auto loan interest even if they take the standard deduction. By comparison, the mortgage interest deduction is only available to taxpayers who itemize.",
      "Which vehicles qualify for the deduction?",
      "The tax break applies to the purchase of new cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds (referred to as light vehicles). Used cars don't qualify.",
      "To qualify for the deduction, a vehicle also must be assembled in the U.S., which further limits the tax break.",
      "The deduction also only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes. And it excludes autos that are leased, which represent about one-quarter of all auto sales in the U.S., according to Experian.",
      "What are the income limits for the auto loan deduction?",
      "The full break can only be claimed by single taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $100,000 or less or married couples with a MAGI of $200,000 or less.",
      "Modified adjusted gross income is your adjusted gross income, which can be found on line 11 of your 1040 tax return, with some items like savings bond interest added back in, according to the IRS.",
      "Under the new law, the auto loan deduction shrinks for people with MAGIs above those thresholds, with the amount reduced by $200 for each $1,000 in income above those levels. The deduction is completely phased out for single filers earning above $150,000 and married couples with incomes above $250,000.",
      "How many Americans will qualify for the car loan deduction?",
      "An estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year if purchasing patterns stay the same and after excluding commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "About 60% of the 15.9 million new light vehicles sold last year were financed with auto loans, according to Cox data.",
      "How much will the car loan deduction save on my taxes?",
      "That depends on the size of your auto loan and whether you fall below the income thresholds for the new tax break, but the typical car buyer could save hundreds per year on their taxes.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year because interest payments on loans are front-loaded, while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "Car buyers who qualify for an auto loan rate of about 6.5%, typically available to consumers with high credit scores, could deduct $3,000 in the first year of owning their car and about $1,800 per year after that for the remainder of the loan,\u00a0according to the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Deductions reduce a filer's taxable income, which helps lower their tax burden. For instance, someone in the 22% tax bracket could save $660 on their taxes by claiming a $3,000 auto loan deduction.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate \u2014 typical of people with subprime credit scores \u2014 an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher and its leader, Rupert Murdoch, after the paper published a story on what it called a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that the paper alleged was signed by Mr. Trump.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, includes two counts of defamation each seeking at least $10 billion in damages, for a total of at least $20 billion. The lawsuit alleges the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging,\" and accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures.\"",
      "The paper claimed the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "The president has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein years ago, but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The suit names the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, along with its parent company, News Corporation. Also named in the lawsuit as defendants are Wall Street Journal reporters Joseph Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar, the bylines on the Epstein story, as well as Murdoch and Dow Jones CEO Robert Thomson.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump referred to it as a \"POWERHOUSE Lawsuit\" and a \"historic legal action.\"",
      "A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "Defamation lawsuits face a high bar to success in U.S. courts. Typically, for a public figure to win a defamation suit, they need to demonstrate not only that false claims were made about them, but also that the defendant acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning that they knew the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "Facing pressure to disclose more details on Epstein, who died in his jail cell in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges, Mr. Trump on Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. The Justice Department late Friday filed a motion to unseal that grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",

    "story": [
      "Justin Fulcher, a senior staffer at the Pentagon and adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been ousted, three sources familiar with the matter told CBS News Saturday.",
      "Fulcher started at the Defense Department as a member of billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. He was then later promoted to a post as senior adviser to Hegseth.",
      "In April, a Pentagon spokesperson announced Fulcher's role as a part of a new Defense Department leadership team, along with Marine Col. Ricky Buria and Patrick Weaver -- both Hegseth aides -- and chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell. It was created after sensitive military plans regarding an attack on the Houthis in Yemen were shared in a chat on the Signal messaging app in March between Hegseth and other top Trump administration officials.",
      "\"The Department of Defense is grateful to Justin Fulcher for his work on behalf of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth. We wish him well in his future endeavors,\" Parnell in a statement to CBS News Saturday.",
      "Hegseth's office has seen a staffing shakeup in the wake of the Signal scandal. In March, Hegseth senior adviser Dan Caldwell and deputy chief of staff Dan Selnick were fired amid a leak probe, while his chief of staff Joe Kasper, was transitioned to a new role as a special government employee handling \"special projects.\"",
      "The Defense Department also released a statement on behalf of Fulcher that read: \"As planned, I've completed 6 months of service in government to my country. Working alongside the dedicated men and women of the Department of Defense has been incredibly inspiring.",
      "\"Revitalizing the warrior ethos, rebuilding the military, and reestablishing deterrence are just some of the historic accomplishments I'm proud to have witnessed. Still, this is just the beginning.",
      "\"None of this could have happened without Secretary Hegseth's decisive leadership or President Trump's continued confidence in our team.",
      "\"I'm grateful to both, and to the extraordinary civilians and service members who turn vision into action every day.",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday afternoon that it is eliminating its scientific division, known as the Office of Research and Development.",
      "The move to shutter the ORD comes one day after the agency said it was undergoing a reorganization involving several other EPA divisions.",
      "ORD conducts critical research to \"safeguard human health and ecosystems from environmental pollutants,\" according to its website. More than 1,500 employees, including scientists and researchers, are dispersed across the country at 11 different locations, but the bulk are based at the EPA's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at a large scientific facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.",
      "Eliminating the office will bring $748.8 million in savings, according to a news release from the agency.",
      "The EPA had 16,155 employees back in January 2025, but following voluntary retirements, dismissals, and other reduction in force (RIF) actions, it is now down to 12,488 employees, the agency said in its release Friday, a reduction of about 22% of its staff. The staffing cuts include 3,201 employees who took the Trump administration's so-called \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation program, as well as those who took early retirement.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement Friday. \"This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.\"",
      "It was anticipated that ORD would be impacted, according to earlier documents that outlined the agency's RIF plans. Back in March, the documents indicated that somewhere between 50% to 75% of ORD employees would not be retained, the majority of them leading scientists in their field of research.",
      "A source inside ORD told CBS News Friday that employees found out about the reduction in force via the press release that was sent out to the public, and has not received any formal communication from the agency about what will happen next.",
      "\"A friend texted me the press release,\" the source told CBS News, \"that is how I found out.\"",
      "According to the source, most employees are anxiously checking their email, waiting to see if they'll be reassigned to another program office, or impacted by the reduction.",
      "Some ORD employees have already received notification that they have been reassigned, while most wait to learn their fate. In May, ORD employees were told they would be contacted by other programs inside the agency to discuss potential, lateral moves. But according to the source, it now appears that impacted individuals won't get much of a choice: either take the reassignment if one is offered, or leave the agency.",
      "\"I don't think I can stay in the U.S.,\" one source told CBS News, \"there are no jobs here.\"",
      "Because of cuts to the federal workforce and cuts to scientific research, there are very few scientific positions available in the U.S., and some are now contemplating work abroad.",
      "\"Today's cuts dismantle one of the world's most respected environmental health research organizations,\" said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former EPA principal deputy assistant administrator for science, in a statement. \"EPA's science office has long been recognized internationally for advancing public health protections through rigorous science. Reducing its workforce under the guise of cost savings is both misleading and dangerous. This does not save taxpayers money; it simply shifts costs to hospitals, families and communities left to bear the health and economic consequences of increased pollution and weakened oversight. The people of this country are not well served by these actions. They are left more vulnerable.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump signed the country's first major legislation aimed at regulating cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing \"the exciting new frontier\" for the technology.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi said the Justice Department is \"ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\" A judge will make the final call on whether the material can be made public, and the process could take weeks or months.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In an exclusive interview, Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CBS News he's not a \"proponent\" of agents wearing masks during arrest operations, but said he will allow the practice to continue due to concerns about his officers' safety.",
      "He also confirmed ICE plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal histories.",
      "Pressed on concerns about masked ICE officers and the possibility that imposters could exploit the practice by posing as immigration agents, Lyons said, \"That's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks.\"",
      "\"However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it,\" Lyons said during his first television network sit-down interview at ICE headquarters in Washington. \"I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves.\"",
      "Asked if he will allow ICE personnel to wear masks, Lyons said, \"I will.\"",
      "More of the interview with Lyons will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, July 20, at 10:30 a.m. ET.",
      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",
      "Lyons said ICE is \"working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for.\"",
      "He cited the \"many\" so-called \"got-ways\" who entered the U.S. illegally without getting caught under the Biden administration and \"just totally disappeared off the grid.\"",
      "Lyons suggested ICE would use different datasets, including from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to locate the \"worst of the worst\" and those ordered deported from the U.S.",

      "Some of the families of the Venezuelan deportees have denied that they have gang connections, and a \"60 Minutes\" investigation in April found that most of the detainees did not have criminal convictions.",
      "The Venezuelan government confirmed Friday's swap, saying in a statement it \"has achieved the release of the 252 Venezuelan citizens who remained kidnapped and subjected to forced disappearance in a concentration camp, known as CECOT, in the Republic of El Salvador.\"",
      "Officials describe \"down-to-the-wire\" deal",
      "A senior administration official said the deal with El Salvador and Venezuela was \"essentially down to the wire.\" The flight carrying the detainees took off from Venezuela at around 3:40 p.m. ET and left Venezuelan airspace at around 3:55 p.m. The official alleged the Venezuelan government took \"one last stand\" by briefly delaying Friday's swap as a \"power flex.\"",
      "The prisoner swap was arranged as Venezuela faces intense U.S. sanctions that limit the country's once-lucrative oil industry, and came one day after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on six leaders and affiliates of Tren de Aragua. A senior administration official said Friday's deal was \"humanitarian in nature\" and there was \"not a discussion of sanctions whatsoever.\"",
      "Rubio credited Bukele \u2014 who has cast himself as a key ally in Mr. Trump's deportation push \u2014 for the swap. Bukele posted on X that his government initially proposed the swap to Venezuela's government in April.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department on Friday formally asked a federal judge to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Friday formally asked a federal judge to unseal transcripts from grand jury proceedings involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The filing from federal prosecutors comes a day after President Trump said he asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of \"any and all pertinent grand jury testimony, subject to court approval.\" Bondi said the Justice Department would ask the federal court in Manhattan on Friday to make public the grand jury transcripts.",
      "The Justice Department filed a request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's 2019 child sex trafficking charges in New York, which ended when Epstein died in custody later that year. It also petitioned for the release of grand jury transcripts in the case against Ghislaine Maxwell, who in 2021 was convicted of conspiring with Epstein, and said it will ask a South Florida court to release transcripts. Epstein was initially investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges.",
      "The judges overseeing the cases will be the final decision-makers as to whether and how much of the grand jury documents can be released. If the judges do grant the government's requests to unseal the material, it's unlikely to be immediately available, and it could be weeks or months before the records are unsealed. Federal rules typically require matters before a grand jury to be kept secret.",
      "In its filings Friday, the Justice Department said it will work to redact \"victim-related information and other personal identifying information.\" It argued the releases are justified \"as a matter of public interest.\"",
      "The White House has spent the past week dealing with the fallout from a Justice Department and FBI memo that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and confirmed that he died by suicide. The memo, which detailed the findings of a review of Epstein's case, also said there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI wrote that they would not release any additional information about Epstein's case, and said the review did not uncover evidence that would lead to an investigation into uncharged third parties.",
      "In Friday's court petitions, the department said \"there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the Memorandum's conclusions,\" and \"transparency to the American public is of the utmost importance to this Administration.\"",
      "Transcripts of the grand jury proceedings likely do not constitute the entirety of the evidence that the FBI and Justice Department collected in their investigation into Epstein. A list released by the Justice Department in February shows investigators gathered financial records, travel logs, photographs, data from phones and computers, and blueprints of property Epstein owned. It's unknown how much of that underlying material was presented to the grand jury, and whether it would be included in a release.",
      "Thousands of pages of documents have already been made public through court records in other lawsuits and public records requests.",
      "The memo earlier this month sparked immense backlash against Mr. Trump and Bondi from his supporters, many of whom were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there was nothing else to be released. Bondi had pledged to release files related to Epstein and suggested in a February interview with Fox News that a \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said Bondi was referring to \"all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.\"",
      "Still, Laura Loomer, an ardent defender of Mr. Trump, called for Bondi to be fired, and even House Speaker Mike Johnson told a conservative podcaster that \"we should put everything out there and let the people decide.\" He later tried to downplay any division between him and the president.",
      "Mr. Trump has tried to blunt the outrage and claimed his backers have been duped by Democrats who deliberately stirred up the interest in Epstein.",
      "\"[A]ll these people want to talk about, with strong prodding by the Fake News and the success starved Dems, is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" the president wrote Wednesday on Truth Social. \"Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",
      "But many of Mr. Trump's supporters, as well as administration officials like Vice President JD Vance, FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, had suggested for years that Democrats were deliberately trying to conceal information about Epstein and his alleged list of clients.",
      "The Justice Department in February distributed binders to 15 right-wing social media influencers at the White House that were labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" But the influencers said they contained documents that were already in the public domain.",
      "Epstein was arrested in Florida in 2006 and pleaded guilty to two state prostitution charges in 2008. Then, in 2019, a federal grand jury indicted him on one count of sex trafficking of minors and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls from 2002 through 2005, and worked with others who set up sexual encounters with victims at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "Epstein and Mr. Trump were friends for years, running in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. On Thursday, the president lashed out at a story in the Wall Street Journal that chronicled the pair's relationship, which the president has said ended before Epstein's first arrest in 2006. The Journal reported that Mr. Trump signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" Mr. Trump called the letter \"fake\" and said he would sue the Journal, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story.",
      "Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial. The Justice Department's inspector general investigated Epstein's death and agreed with a medical examiner's determination that he died by suicide.",
      "Ghislaine Maxwell, an associate of Epstein's, was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 1.40% on Thursday, rising to $120,584.80; etherium's price rose 3.41% to $3,486.86.",

      "Bondi toured Alcatraz, currently part of the National Park Service, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, arriving on a Coast Guard vessel. They were joined by a contingent of administration officials and Secret Service staffers who walked in the chilly bay air among the crumbling buildings, many dating back to the late 19th century.",
      "The attorney general was seen posing for pictures in front of Alcatraz signs and vista points on the island. Later, Bondi and Burgum posted images of their tour on the X social media platform.",

      "Trump administration's push to reopen Alcatraz",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice told CBS News that Bondi and Burgum were visiting Alcatraz to receive a briefing on the facility and the surrounding island. They were also directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning to rehabilitate and reopen the facility, the spokesperson said.",
      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi spoke about Alcatraz's potential to once again hold prisoners.",
      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "Following the announcement, Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said in a statement that his agency would \"vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda\" and that he ordered \"an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps.\"",
      "Alcatraz's history as federal penitentiary",
      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed during their escape, and two drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service. The city of San Francisco benefits indirectly through spending at hotels, restaurants, shops, and local tourism businesses.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

      "An ongoing purge of federal prosecutors from the Justice Department has impacted the criminal case against a Florida businessman accused of fleecing children with special needs.",
      "The latest wave of firings included the prosecutor who was helping lead the criminal case against\u00a0Leo Govoni, whose scheme allegedly bilked approximately $100 million from a fund to help people with disabilities. Michael Gordon, who also handled a series of U.S. Capitol riot prosecutions, was among several prosecutors fired in recent weeks, CBS News has learned. Gordon had recently taken over formal duties for prosecuting Govoni's case in Florida.",
      "Critics have accused the Trump administration of seeking political retribution for the U.S. Capitol insurrection cases by firing prosecutors, investigators and at least one administrator who worked on the cases. The Justice Department also fired investigators and prosecutors who helped former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation of President Trump's alleged mishandling of classified records and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "More than 20 total firings have been confirmed by CBS News. The Justice Department has not commented on the firings.",
      "Gordon's dismissal risks complicating the timeline for the Govoni case. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, is urging the Justice Department to reverse course and rehire Gordon.",
      "Castor said in a statement, \"The victims of Govoni's alleged fraud number in the thousands\u2014each with painful and personal stories. Mr. Gordon's removal places this case, and their hope for accountability, in jeopardy.\"",
      "Govoni is accused of being part of a scheme to embezzle money from an organization that was established to help manage money for people with special needs. The Justice Department said earlier this year,\u00a0 \"The defendants conspired to use the funds of special needs clients as a personal piggy bank, stealing $100 million dollars meant for the most vulnerable members of our society to enrich themselves.\"",
      "Amparo Perales, a mother whose son Javier has needed care for cortical blindness and severe encephalitis, said her family lost $2 million in the scheme. Perales told CBS News she was \"shocked\" by Gordon's firing.",
      "\"These victims already have difficult lives and futures. A delay in the legal process is detrimental to the well being of the victims,\" Perales said.",
      "Rebekah Bowman of Florida, whose son, Kienen Freeman, suffers from a severe seizure disorder, said she lost more than $1 million in funds for her son because of Govoni's alleged scheme.",
      "\"It took long enough to get him arrested. People have been through a lot and don't want any more delays,\" Bowman said.",
      "Govoni was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, money laundering conspiracy and multiple counts of fraud. He has not yet entered a plea, and an arraignment is scheduled for Thursday. Govoni's lawyers asked for him to be released pre-trial, noting he has \"no prior criminal history\" and describing him as a \"67-year-old in poor physical health.\" CBS News has reached out to his attorney for comment.",
      "An accountant for Govoni's company was also charged as part of the alleged conspiracy, and a not-guilty plea was entered in his case.",
      "Prosecutors said Govoni founded the Center for Special Needs Trust Administration in 2000 and helped manage approximately $200 million in funds and more than 2,000 special needs trusts.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Govoni used the organization's accounts as a \"slush fund.\" Federal investigators said Govoni used the money to \"purchase real estate, travel via private jet, fund a brewery, make deposits into his personal bank accounts, and pay personal debts.\"",
      "In a series of letters filed with the federal court in Tampa last month, one parent of a person with special needs wrote, \"I wish you could look into the eyes of my son and the many other medically needy victims and tell them that you're going to do the right thing and keep that man behind bars where he belongs.\"",
      "Another parent wrote, \"Please do not let this horrible criminal out of jail. He is clever and surely has money hidden and plans to go into hiding if released. All his victims have breathed a sigh of relief when we heard he was finally arrested. The first relief any of us have felt since this has happened.\"",
      "Another victim wrote, \"Who steals from victimized children in foster care? The disabled? The most vulnerable amongst us? Someone who has no conscience, compassion, or mercy.\"",
      "Gordon is listed in court records as a Tampa-based prosecutor for the Justice Department. Like many federal prosecutors, he brought cases related to the Jan. 6 riots \u2014 which was the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history, with more than 1,500 defendants.

    "summary": "President Trump late Thursday ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump late Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0as his administration faces pressure to disclose more details on the late sex offender.",
      "\"Based on the ridiculous amount of publicity given to Jeffrey Epstein, I have asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, subject to Court approval,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \"This SCAM, perpetuated by the Democrats, should end, right now!\"",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X minutes later, \"we are ready to move the court tomorrow to unseal the grand jury transcripts.\"",
      "A judge will need to make the final decision on whether material can be released, which could take some time and is unlikely to be immediate.",
      "It's unclear what material the Trump administration will ask to be released. It's not clear how much of the Epstein-related material in the government's possession is grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",
      "The government is generally required to keep grand jury materials secret, and it's common for not all material that is shown to a grand jury \u2014 which meets before a person is criminally indicted \u2014 to emerge during a criminal case.",
      "A request of this kind by the government is unusual, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner, and a former federal prosecutor.",
      "\"I've been in and around federal criminal cases for over 30 years. I've never heard of this before,\" he told CBS News.",
      "While the scope of the government's request is still unknown, Epner says it could encompass an \"enormous quantity of data.\" Mr. Trump said the government would seek the release of grand jury testimony, which Epner noted may include exhibits that witnesses testified about before a grand jury.",
      "\"I would not bet against there being anything, from the most interesting thing in the world to the least interesting thing in the world, in that material,\" said Epner, who told CBS News he believes calls for more information to be disclosed in the Epstein case are warranted.",
      "Epner joked: \"If we were to find out the location of the corpse of Jimmy Hoffa, I would not be surprised.\"",
      "Material likely will not be released immediately, according to Epner, who said, \"weeks would be moving very quickly, months is likely.\" Under court rules, grand jury material is typically only released under certain circumstances, often when it's needed for some other investigation. The government's grounds for release in this case aren't clear.",
      "In this case, both associates and alleged victims of Epstein's may oppose some disclosures.",
      "\"I would not be surprised if a number of people came forward under pseudonyms to object to the release of grand jury material related to them,\" Epner said. \"I also would not be surprised if some of the victims\u2026came forward and said, 'Yes, we do want things to be revealed.'\"",
      "Trump administration faces Epstein fallout",
      "Last week's memo on Epstein reignited years of questions \u2014 and conspiracy theories \u2014 on the disgraced financier, including speculation about the circumstances of Epstein's death in custody, and about whether the federal government was concealing information to shield some of Epstein's famous friends.",
      "Bondi had pledged to release files related to Epstein, and suggested in a Fox News interview in February a \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" (She later said she meant generally that material on Epstein was sitting on her desk.)",
      "In late February, the Justice Department distributed binders to over a dozen right-wing social media influencers labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1,\" though the influencers later said many of the materials were already in the public domain.",
      "Some Republicans and vocal Trump supporters were dissatisfied with last week's memo, in some cases calling for more disclosures or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Epstein case \u2014 which White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president does not support.",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, has scolded some Republicans for buying into what he called the \"the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax,\" calling them \"stupid people\" and \"weaklings\" who are \"do[ing] the Democrats work.\"",
      "Shortly before pushing for the release of grand jury testimony, the president on Thursday denied a Wall Street Journal report on what the newspaper described as a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Epstein \u2014 featuring a drawing of a nude woman \u2014 that the paper claimed was signed by Mr. Trump in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump and Epstein had crossed paths for years, though Mr. Trump says they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "Mr. Trump called the letter a \"FAKE\" and threatened to sue the Journal, as well as its parent company News Corp and leader Rupert Murdoch.",
      "\"These are not my words, not the way I talk. Also, I don't draw pictures,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",
      "In June, the White House asked Congress to cancel $9.4 billion in appropriations that had previously been approved. The request, known as the rescissions package, passed in the House in mid-June and would cut roughly $8 billion from international assistance, including organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The Senate added an amendment to exempt $400 million in global health funding for PEPFAR, a program started during the Bush administration to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries.",
      "The revised package passed by a vote of 51-48, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in voting against it.",
      "\"My obligation is to my constituents and to the Constitution,\" Murkowski told reporters after voting against an earlier procedural vote\u00a0Tuesday. \"So I look at the Constitution and say that it is \u2026 the legislative branch that has the power of the purse. I take that charge personally, and so I'm going to execute on it.\"",
      "In addition to the foreign assistance cuts, the package includes $1.1 billion in reductions for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "The legislation follows an executive order by President Trump in May directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Board to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, alleging partisan bias.",
      "\"Neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens,\" the order stated.",
      "Maher previously testified before a House subcommittee in March alongside PBS CEO Paula Kerger, where they defended their organizations from the accusations of bias. In her interview this week, Maher reiterated that NPR prioritizes stories that \"directly speak to Americans' political interests and changing beliefs.\"",
      "\"I take all criticism seriously, as I think any news organization should,\" Maher said. \"And if there's a perception that we are not serving the full range of American political life, well we need to, we need to respond to that.\"",
      "Ahead of a Friday deadline, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to support the clawbacks or risk losing his support.",
      "\"It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post this month, using a nickname designed to mock MSNBC. \"Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican senators have voiced concerns about cuts to public broadcasting, especially for those serving rural and Native communities. During Wednesday's vote-a-rama, Sen. Maria Cantwell warned that eliminating funding for CPB could endanger those who rely on radio for emergency information.",
      "\"We're not just putting PBS at risk here, we're putting millions of Americans who depend on local media for life-saving information [at risk],\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in a floor speech. \"And what's in this rescission request is really making sure that public broadcasters don't have that ability, at least in 20 states where they have emergency plans.\"",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a GOP holdout who initially expressed skepticism about the rescissions package, said this week he intends to support it after working with the White House to reallocate unused funding through the Department of the Interior to tribal stations.",
      "\"It will keep them in operation. It will be for one year at a time,\" Rounds said.",
      "The rescissions package comes on the heels of the devastating July 4 floods on Texas' Guadalupe River, which left more than 130 dead and search efforts are still ongoing for more than 100 still unaccounted for.",
      "Since the tragedy, there have been questions about the efficiency of emergency alert systems \u2014 many of which, Maher said, rely on public broadcasting.",
      "Maher said communities in rural areas like that would feel the largest impacts of the funding cuts. She said some NPR stations receive \"more than 50% of their budget\" from federal funds and could face tough decisions, from staffing layoffs to potential station closures.",
      "WDIY, a public radio station in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, has a mix of news and musical programming that is produced by a staff of four along with a host of community volunteers. About 15% of its overall budget comes from CPB funding.",
      "\"Losing that money would mean that we would have to make some serious decisions about do we carry NPR programming anymore because that money helps us pay for that programming,\"\u00a0 WDIY Executive Director Margaret McConnell told CBS News.",

      "\"[T]hese Scams and Hoaxes are all the Democrats are good at - It's all they have - They are no good at governing, no good at policy, and no good at picking winning candidates,\" he wrote. \"Also, unlike Republicans, they stick together like glue. Their new SCAM is what we will forever call the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax, and my PAST supporters have bought into this 'bullshit,' hook, line, and sinker.\"",

Let these weaklings continue forward and do the Democrats work, don't even think about talking of our incredible and unprecedented success, because I don't want their support anymore!\"",

      "Mr. Trump's statements highlight the deep divisions in his party over the handling of the Epstein case, including among some of his strongest supporters.",
      "The current controversy began last week, when the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review of the evidence against Epstein, a well-connected financier who was convicted of sex trafficking and died in federal custody in 2019. The department said the review found no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein had blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "The memo was met with anger from many of Mr. Trump's supporters, who have long called for more transparency about the Epstein files, which they believe might implicate other powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.",
      "The review also exposed internal divisions within the administration itself. FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's handling of the case, and prominent conservatives have called for Bondi to be fired or resign over her decision to withhold any additional files. The president has defended Bondi's work on the case, telling reporters on Tuesday that she has \"handled it very well.\"",
      "Prominent Democrats have pressured their GOP colleagues to push for more transparency from the administration, so far unsuccessfully. Two procedural maneuvers in the House that would have required the administration to reveal more evidence about the Epstein case failed to overcome GOP opposition earlier this week.",
      "But Mr. Trump's supporters in conservative media and his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill are continuing to call for the administration to release more of what the government knows about the Epstein case. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Mr. Trump's closest congressional ally, told conservative podcast host Benny Johnson that he is \"for transparency\" in an interview on Tuesday.",
      "\"It's a very delicate subject, but you should put everything out there, let the people decide it,\" the speaker said. \"Pam Bondi needs to come forward and explain it to the American people. Let's get this thing resolved.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday called on the Trump administration to release all records related to Jeffrey Epstein's prosecution and alleged co-conspirators, saying \"the time has come\" for transparency while emphasizing that the names of victims should be protected.",
      "\"I think the time has come for the administration to release all of the files regarding Jeffrey Epstein's investigation and prosecution,\" Pence said in an interview with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. \"It's important that we protect the names of the victims. They should be excluded from any disclosure.\"",
      "His remarks come as President Trump has taken a sharply different tone. In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump dismissed the scrutiny surrounding Epstein's associates as politically motivated. \"It's a big hoax,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's started by Democrats. It's been run by the Democrats for four years.\" He claimed the matter was being pushed by \"some stupid Republicans\" doing Democrats' work.",
      "In a Truth Social post earlier in the day, Mr. Trump wrote that the \"Jeffrey Epstein Hoax\" is being used by \"past supporters\" who had been \"conned by the Lunatic Left\" and declared, \"I don't want their support anymore.\"",
      "Pence pushed back on the claim that the matter is politically driven. \"Jeffrey Epstein's prosecution began during the Bush administration, continued through the Obama years,\" he said. \"I know of no reason why this administration, once the victims' names are protected, should not release all the files on Jeffrey Epstein.\"",
      "The Justice Department last week said its review of the Epstein case identified more than 1,000 victims. The review also concluded that Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility in August 2019. Investigators found no evidence of a so-called \"client list\" or that Epstein had blackmailed prominent individuals.",
      "\"I just think we ought to get the facts to the American people, and I've always believed in transparency,\" Pence said.",
      "Pence was also asked about Mr. Trump's signals that he may seek to remove Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. \"Well, I've been a critic of the Fed over the years,\" Pence said. \"I have real concerns about what's called the dual mandate where the Federal Reserve is supposed to worry about protecting the dollar, as well as full employment.\"",
      "Pence, however, noted that economic challenges \"don't flow as much to the Fed as they do to the policies of the administration,\" and drew a contrast with how tariffs were handled during the first Trump term. \"We used tariffs and the threat of tariffs to bring down trade barriers and to open up markets,\" he said.",
      "CBS News reported that Mr. Trump on Tuesday night asked GOP lawmakers in a private Oval Office meeting whether he should fire Powell before the end of his term. \"Almost every one of them said I should, but I'm more conservative than they are,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday regarding the night prior's meeting.",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Jul 2025 18:26:49 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News analysis finds that up to $63 million has been raised for Mr. Trump's future presidential library so far from legal settlements alone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's efforts to direct millions of dollars to his future presidential library has drawn fresh attention to a lack of visibility into the identities or potential interests of the donors who are funding it, a longstanding Washington concern facing past presidents from both parties.",
      "Two prominent Senate Democrats say they are preparing to introduce a bill Wednesday that would regulate fundraising for presidential libraries, according to documents shared with CBS News.",
      "\"Donald Trump is using his presidential library as a tool for bribery while he is still in office,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who is introducing the legislation with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut.",
      "\"Many of the donations to Trump's future library are coming straight from companies and special interests that need a favor from Trump,\" Warren said. \"Right now there are no rules.\"",
      "The effort was spurred by a series of announcements about gifts to the Trump library, including an opulently appointed Boeing 747\u00a0given to the U.S. Air Force by the\u00a0Qatari royal family for the president's use, after which it would be donated to the library for Mr. Trump's post-presidency.",
      "The proceeds of four large legal settlements with the president are also reportedly bound for his library fund. The multimillion-dollar settlements stem from Mr. Trump's lawsuits against Meta, ABC News, X (formerly Twitter) and Paramount. Paramount is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The funds from the four settlements alone could total up to $63 million, according to a CBS News review of news reports and court documents.",
      "Sens. Warren and Blumenthal, along with three House members, Reps. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.), Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.) and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), are proposing several measures to restrict fundraising for presidential libraries. Among them is a contribution cap of $10,000 per person while the president is still serving in office.",
      "The legislation also proposes quarterly disclosures for all donations of $200 or more, and imposes a two-year \"cooling off\" period after the end of their term during which a president cannot accept donations from foreign nationals, federal government contractors or individuals seeking presidential pardons. Finally, the bill also explicitly bars the use of library donations for personal expenses.",
      "\"Right now, there are basically no rules,\" said Warren. \"The settlements show everyone who has business pending in front of the federal government, that if they've got enough money and can funnel it to Donald Trump through his future presidential library, they might receive better treatment from the US government.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Funding is largely opaque and unregulated",
      "The total amount raised for the Trump library to date is likely far greater than the amounts visible through the president's publicly announced legal settlements. For instance, funds leftover from the $239 million raised by the Trump-Vance inaugural committee \u2014 including millions from tech companies and CEOs such as Amazon, OpenAI, Apple and Uber \u2014 were expected to be redirected to the library, according to multiple news reports. It's unclear how much of those funds have already been transferred. Donations to inaugural funds are required to be reported publicly, whereas presidential libraries are under no such obligation.",
      "The $400 million jet the Trump administration accepted from Qatar in May is also slated to be transferred to the Trump library shortly before he leaves office.",
      "Other than those instances, the funding for the private foundations that support presidential libraries is largely opaque and unregulated, experts said.",
      "\"No one outside the organization knows who contributes to presidential library funds,\" said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer who advises tax exempt organizations. \"That information is provided to the IRS, but is not made public.\"",
      "While campaign funds have historically been tightly regulated under a series of laws passed after the Watergate scandal, there are no restrictions on donations to presidential libraries, Kappel said. While in office, presidents can solicit unlimited library donations from anyone \u2014 including foreign nationals, individuals seeking presidential pardons and corporations with federal contracts.",
      "\"The lack of transparency could raise the appearance of impropriety,\" said Kappel. \"No one will know who is making donations to the presidential library while the president is still in office and making government policy.\"",
      "Trustees of the two Trump library organizations and the Trump Organization did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The Obama Presidential Foundation, which oversees the development of former President Barack Obama's library\u00a0in Chicago, was founded\u00a0in January 2014, a year after Obama's second term began. The foundation said it would disclose all donors and donations over $200 on a quarterly basis on their website in an effort to increase transparency. It was estimated in June 2021 that the center will cost roughly $700 million to construct.",
      "President George W. Bush's library foundation began fundraising efforts in the spring of 2009, after he left office. The foundation did not publicly disclose its donors. The cost of that effort clocked in at $250 million. The George W. Bush Presidential Center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, opened in 2013.",
      "The first presidential library was established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938. Since then, presidential libraries are built and maintained with a mix of private and federal funds. Typically the library itself is constructed with private donations, and occasionally with support from local government or university partners. The library is then transferred to the federal government and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration, or NARA, which oversees the preservation of presidential documents and has a congressionally appropriated budget for maintaining the library structures.",
      "Two nonprofits behind the Trump library",
      "In the last year, the Trump family and associates have established two funds for presidential library donations, according to incorporation records reviewed by CBS News. Both are incorporated as nonprofits in Florida.",
      "The first, the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Fund Inc., was created in December 2024, before President Trump was sworn in, and shortly after ABC announced it would donate $15 million to the future Trump library to settle a defamation claim the president brought against the network. According to incorporation documents, the fund was established by Jacob Roth, a Florida-based attorney who also filed the paperwork for both the Trump Vance Inauguration Committee Inc. and the Trump Vance Inaugural Committee Inc. in November. According to incorporation documents for the organization, the purpose of the fund is to \"to preserve and steward the legacy of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency.\"",
      "A few months later, in May, a second nonprofit was incorporated under the name Donald J. Trump Presidential Library Foundation. There are three listed trustees: Eric Trump; Tiffany Trump's husband, Michael Boulos; and James Kiley, a New York attorney who represented Mr. Trump between 2020 and 2022 during one of his legal battles against his niece, Mary Trump.",
      "This foundation was created to \"steward, preserve, and celebrate the legacy and historical record of President Donald J. Trump and his presidency,\" according to filings.",
      "There may not be rules for what money can go into a presidential library fund, but there are strict rules for how nonprofit funds can be spent.",
      "As nonprofit 501(c)(3)s, tax laws prohibit the use of funds from a presidential library for personal benefit. The IRS is in charge of enforcing all conflict-of-interest laws for nonprofits, although experts are skeptical about the agency's political will to enforce those provisions.",
      "\"501(c)(3)s are supposed to be used for charitable purposes. To the extent funds are being used beyond that, and outside the scope of a presidential library, that's something the IRS would have to look into,\" said Viriginia Canter, who served as senior ethics counsel for the Treasury Department under both Republican and Democratic administrations.",
      "There is no indication that Mr. Trump or his family are using funds for the libraries for personal expenses.",
      "Past library controversies",
      "The Trump family is not the first to face criticism over donations to a library fund while in office. President Bill Clinton faced significant pushback after he pardoned billionaire businessman Marc Rich, who'd fled to Switzerland after he was indicted in 1983 on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, racketeering, trading with Iran during an embargo and evading more than $48 million in U.S. income taxes.",
      "Clinton's pardon \u2014 which was issued just hours before he left office in January 2001 \u2014 faced scrutiny even from some of his closest allies, who said Rich's pardon appeared to have been bought. They pointed to the $450,000 donation Rich's ex-wife, Denise Rich, bestowed to the Clinton library foundation and the additional $100,000 she donated to Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign.",
      "And in 2008, a GOP lobbyist with ties to the Bush administration was caught on video allegedly soliciting a donation for his presidential library in exchange for setting up a meeting with top White House officials. (It was a sting operation set up by a newspaper; no money changed hands.)",
      "Congress has tried, and largely failed for almost two decades, to pass legislation that would require organizations raising funds for presidential libraries to disclose donations. Since 2007, the House has passed five bills regarding presidential library funding transparency \u2014 the most recent being in 2019 \u2014 but they have all been stalled in the Senate.",

    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",

      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",

In Earth's solar system, the first solid materials to form can now be found inside ancient meteorites. Those ancient meteorites contain a mineral called silicon monoxide, which only forms at extremely high temperatures, like those near a young star.",
      "Scientists were able to identify the formation of silicon monoxide around HOPS-315, which they said tells them they've caught the development of a solar system at an early stage.",
      "\"This is the first time this early stage of planet-building has ever been observed outside our own Solar System,\" the Planetary Society wrote in a social media post about the discovery.",
      "The discovery marks \"the birth of the seeds of the planets,\" study co-author Edwin Bergin, a professor at the University of Michigan, told CBS News. The silicate-mineral rich material around HOPS-315 will make planets after another million years or so.",
      "\"So we are watching the beginnings of the construction of planets,\" Bergin said.",
      "With the discovery, Bergin said researchers now know what to look for to find other budding systems.",
      "ESO's Alma telescope network in Chile captured an image of the still-forming planetary system around HOPS-315. In orange, the image shows the distribution of carbon monoxide blowing away from HOPS-315. Blue shows a narrow jet of silicon monoxide, which is also beaming away from the baby star.",
      "Astronomers hope it can help them learn more about the dawn of our solar system.",
      "\"This system is one of the best that we know to actually probe some of the processes that happened in our Solar System,\" van 't Hoff said in a news release.",
      "HOPS-315 is much younger than the Sun; it's about 100,000 years old, Bergin said.",
      "\"So we get a glimpse of the system in its infancy,\" Bergin said in an email. \"Given that the Sun is 4.6 Billion years old this is a baby star that is still gaining mass and getting bigger.\"",

      "NWA 16788, the largest piece of Mars on Earth, was expected to fetch between $2 million and $4 million during the auction\u00a0in New York City, according to Sotheby's. The final price was $5,296,000, which includes the hammer price, premiums and local taxes, according to the auction house. Sotheby's has not publicly identified the buyer.",
      "Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",
      "Meteorites come from meteors, space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere. Most meteors burn up as they fall toward Earth, but the ones that survive the trip through Earth's atmosphere are considered meteorites. The chunk of Martian rock that was auctioned off by Sotheby's was likely dislodged from the planet by an asteroid strike.",
      "NWA 16788 traveled 140 million miles through space before it crashed in the Sahara Desert, where it was found in Niger's remote Agadez Region in 2023, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "The meteorite weighs just over 54 pounds, which makes it the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell to Namibia.",
      "It's believed that NWA 16788 is a \"relative newcomer here on Earth, having fallen from outer space rather recently,\" Sotheby's said in its auction listing. The meteorite was on public view at Sotheby's New York galleries ahead of the auction on Wednesday.",

      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",

      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",

      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",

    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",

      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",

The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",

      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "Washington has been tightening controls on exports of advanced technology to China for years, citing concerns that know-how meant for civilian use could be deployed for military purposes. The emergence of China's DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities.",
      "In January, before Mr. Trump began his second term in office, the Biden administration launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries.",
      "Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5 billion, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Mr. Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder U.S. competition in a leading edge sector in one of the world's largest markets for technology.",
      "They've also warned that U.S. export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China's AI technology.",

    "story": [
      "Indeed and Glassdoor, the job search and employee review firms, are slashing a total of roughly 1,300 jobs as their parent company, Japan's Recruit Holdings, embraces artificial intelligence.",
      "In an email to employees Thursday, Recruit Holdings CEO Hisayuki \"Deko\" Idekoba said that \"AI is changing the world\" and that the company must adapt accordingly. The layoffs represent about 6% of Recruit Holdings' HR technology workforce.",
      "The cuts will target the companies' research and development, as well as \"people & sustainability,\" teams in the U.S., but other areas and regions will also be affected, according to Recruit Holdings. The company will send notices to employees who are losing their jobs on Thursday.",
      "The move reflects Recruit Holdings' focus on using AI to transform how job-seekers look for work and how employers handle recruitment. As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs come as corporate leaders tout AI's capabilities, while some experts warn that the technology could lead to job losses. Speaking in June at the the Aspen Ideas Festival, for example, Ford CEO Jim Farley said AI is likely to replace half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.",

      "\"This was a horrible accident,\" she cried in court, with her late husband's relatives looking on.  \"I wish and pray constantly that I could be able to take away your pain, but I can't.\"",
      "This case is not a whodunit; it's more of a why'd she do it? Linda admitted she shot her husband, Patrick Duffey, in 2007, but she said it was an awful, and unlikely, accident.  She has had to convince authorities that fact can be stranger than fiction, because her legal defense has featured, among other things, a cast of cartoon characters.",
      "Her lawyer used the words of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd to explain her actions as he insisted she is innocent.",
      "Linda talked to police voluntarily and without a lawyer just hours after the shooting:",
      "Linda Duffey to police:  It was pointed down ... and the next think I know, his head was right there! ... he was just laying there!",
      "Shaun McCarthy and Shannon Laren are veteran homicide detectives with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for 13 years. Forgive the clich\u00e9, but they really did think they'd pretty much seen it all.",
      "Then, on April 26, 2007, they got a call about a shooting at the Duffey's house in suburban Whittier:",
      "Linda Duffey to 911: My husband was gonna go shooting ... and I accidentally shot him. We need help.",

      "The detectives found Patrick Duffey dead on the couch; his left hand was in his pocket.",
      "\"And his right knee was being supported by a pillow. Very comfortable, relaxed,\" Sgt. Laren told \"48 Hours\" correspondent Richard Schlesinger.",
      "There was blood pooled on the floor and splattered on the wall.",
      "\"There was a pretty good sized blood puddle...\" Laren said, pointing to the floor at the end of the couch where Patrick Duffey's head rested.",
      "\"Clearly he had a gunshot wound to the head,\" said Lt. McCarthy.",
      "The couple's two teenage sons, Sean and Thomas, were at school, so Linda was the only surviving witness. Det. Laren had a funny feeling.",
      "\"It looked like he'd been sleeping on the couch,\" he said, \"and somebody just walked up and shot him in his sleep.\"",
      "\"I was leaning ... that this was an accident,\" said McCarthy.",
      "Detective McCarthy has been investigating homicide cases for about 13 years and knows how to spot even the tiniest clues. He saw very little that made him suspicious.",
      "\"Did you guys disagree frequently on cases?\" Schlesinger asked the detectives.",
      "\"I disagree with all of my partners on every case,\" McCarthy replied.",
      "\"How does that work?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"I think we kind of wait until we have more information,\" said Laren.",
      "\"I wanted to hear her story,\" said McCarthy.",
      "\"She was very entertaining ... loved to tell stories,\" said Julie Prendergast, who has been listening to Linda's stories since they first became friends in a college music program in the 1980s.",
      "\"She said, 'Well, actually I'm from Ireland,\" Prendergast said. \"And she started talking with what I thought was a pretty phony accent.  ...That was my first indication that Linda was a little bit different.\"",
      "Prendergast said Linda could be irreverent, even goofy.",
      "\"I would ... say, 'Linda ... I'm gonna tell you something and you're gonna want to laugh, but we're in class right now so don't laugh out loud.' And it would just pop out anyway,\" she said.",
      "After they left school the two friends ended up working at the same place. And one day, Prendergast said, Linda called with some news.",
      "\"She said, 'I'm so excited.  I'm getting married, and I'd like you to be in my wedding!'\" she said.",
      "The groom was a man Linda had met four years earlier: Patrick Duffey, a radio engineer, gun enthusiast, and private pilot.",
      "\"She just said it was like her dream come true and she couldn't be happier,\" said Prendergast.",
      "Patrick's sister, Katherine Hunt, said he and Linda were soul mates and playmates.",
      "\"They seemed happy as a family. ...They understand each other,\" she explained. \"They were kidding with each other, joking with each other.\"",
      "Linda Duffey to police: We're just always just joking around with each other and being silly and having a good time...",
      "And it was that silliness that became a cornerstone of Linda's story when she explained to police what happened the day she killed her husband:",
      "Linda Duffey to police: And I came into the family room and he was sitting on the sofa...",
      "She said they had just come back from a doctor's appointment. Patrick had chronic circulation problems. Linda said he'd been planning to go to the shooting range. His .38, one of three revolvers he kept in the house, was nearby.",
      "Linda Duffey to police: We keep it in this little locked box...",
      "Linda told police she usually stayed away from the guns. But that day, she picked up the .38.",
      "\"And the story got stranger as it went on,\" said McCarthy.",
      "Linda Duffey to police: We do this little silly thing. We always kind of relate little silly conversations to, like, cartoons that we've seen when we were younger and stuff. And he does this silly little Elmer Fudd voice: \"No more buwwets.\"",
      "\"And she claims she said to him, 'No more buwwets?' in Elmer's Fudd's voice,\" McCarthy explained. \"And she said his response was, 'No more buwwets.'\"",
      "Linda said it was a game they played all the time. And when her husband said 'no more bullets' in his Elmer Fudd voice, she took it to mean the gun was empty; that it was safe to try something Patrick had taught her.",
      "\"She said that she then wanted to impress him by showing him she can shoot it cowboy style,\" said McCarthy.",
      "It's called fan firing, and any fan of westerns knows it; you hold the trigger down and keep pulling back the hammer so the gun fires quickly.",
      "Linda Duffey to police: He told me there was no bullets in the gun.",

      "\"The statement about the fan firing, it just didn't sound right,\" said Laren.",
      "But his partner, Lt. McCarthy, who had heard his share of crazy explanations from suspected killers, listened to that panicked 911 tape, listened to Linda's story and concluded the story was just wacky enough to be true.",
      "\"The overwhelming feeling that I got from her was she was odd at best and eccentric at worst,\" he said.",
      "After the detectives interviewed Linda for an hour, they let her go home.",
      "\"When you left work that day did you have in your mind that she was a suspect?\" Schlesinger asked McCarthy.",
      "\"No,\" he replied.",
      "His gut told him Linda was innocent, but he'd need more. He'd need science.",
      "IS FACT STRANGER THAN FICTION?",
      "When he first studied the scene where Linda Duffey killed her husband, Det. Shaun McCarthy was pretty sure it was an accident. He believed her story that she had reenacted their favorite Bugs Bunny cartoon and then fan fired the gun.",
      "And when he talked to Linda later that day, she said nothing that made him doubt her:",
      "Lt. McCarthy: Start with when you got up this morning",
      "Linda Duffey:  It is my fault.",
      "Lt. McCarthy: No, it's not your fault. ... it's just that we need to understand ...",
      "Detectives Laren and McCarthy were beginning to understand more about what happened inside the Duffey home, especially after they talked to the medical examiner, who had just done an autopsy on Patrick Duffey.",
      "\"There was a second gunshot wound,\" said McCarthy.",
      "Linda Duffey claimed this was an accident, but she had shot her husband in the head not once, but twice. Believe it or not, even seasoned investigators can miss that kind of clue at the crime scene.",
      "\"You could not see the second gunshot wound?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Because dry blood and the amount of blood and coagulated blood ... we weren't privy to the second gunshot wound,\" said McCarthy.",
      "\"What did you make of that?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Well, it's \u2014 it certainly was a red flag,\" McCarthy replied.",
      "But it was not just a red flag for McCarthy's partner, Shannon Laren. It was more like a bright red arrow pointing right at Linda Duffey.",
      "\"There was so many highly improbable events that would've had to have all lined up for this to actually have been an accident,\" he explained. \"They didn't line up.\"",
      "Still, McCarthy was not convinced.  \"Why didn't you just say this has got to be murder?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Because I needed to be convinced myself that this was murder,\" McCarthy replied. \"The last thing in the world I wanna do is send an ... innocent person to prison for the rest of their lives.\"",
      "It wasn't enough for McCarthy to know what happened. He wanted to know why it happened.",
      "\"We struggled to find a compelling motive.  And we looked.  And we looked.  And we looked,\" he said.",
      "But they couldn't really find one. The Duffeys seemed to be an average middle class family living in the Los Angeles suburbs. There was a life insurance policy on Patrick, but they'd bought it decades earlier. There was no evidence of cheating. And considering her personality, McCarthy couldn't just dismiss Linda's story.",
      "\"It's like, 'OK, maybe this could've happened the way she says, 'cause she's so quirky and eccentric,\" he said.",
      "But it was about to get a little harder for McCarthy to believe Linda's story because of Tracy Peck, a firearms expert for the sheriff's department who was brought into the case by McCarthy and Laren.",
      "Remember, according to Linda, she fired the way they did in the movies. It is possible to do that pretty easily \u2014 with the right kind of gun.",
      "The guns used in the cowboy movies were single-action guns. You can easily keep firing quickly by pulling and releasing the hammer while the trigger is held back.",
      "\"When the hammer is fanned, the cylinder will rotate with this type of gun. So it will fire the cartridges in the chambers of the cylinder as its being fanned,\" Peck demonstrated.",
      "The Duffeys had two single-action revolvers in the house. But the gun Linda used to shoot her husband was not one of them. It was a double-action revolver \u2014 and there's a big difference.",
      "\"The shooter simply pulls the trigger, which accomplishes both cocking the hammer and releasing the hammer.  And the gun will fire,\" Peck demonstrated.",
      "To rapid fire a double-action revolver, the shooter has to do all sorts of things at the right time and in the right sequence.",
      "Asked if that type of gun is designed to be fired that way, Peck said, \"No.\"",
      "\"For the purposes of this case, I essentially invented a way in which I would conceivably fan this. That included pulling the trigger, releasing the trigger, fanning the hammer, pulling the trigger, releasing the trigger, and fanning the hammer, but doing it pretty quickly,\" Peck demonstrated.",
      "And Peck said it's very hard to aim while doing all that. She said the unexpected, deafening noise of the gun, and the recoil, would have alarmed Linda if she didn't know the gun was loaded.",
      "According to Peck, it would have been next to impossible for Linda, who claimed to be an amateur, to shoot her husband twice, rapidly by accident \u2014 especially since the wounds were so close together.",
      "\"I don't find it a very believable story,\" she told Schlesinger.",
      "\"I still wanted to believe her,\" McCarthy said of Linda. \"But it clearly couldn't have gone down the way that she said it went down.\"",
      "By now, Detective McCarthy was all but certain that Patrick Duffey's death was no accident, but the two detectives felt they didn't have enough to prove it.  Because of a heavy workload \u2014 it took two years \u2014 but in January 2009, McCarthy and Laren brought Linda back in for another chat.",
      "The conversation was recorded:",
      "Linda Duffey to police: He showed me how to do it really fast. He goes, \"You gotta do it like the cowboys.\"",
      "\"Well, in the second interview \u2014 I think we were both convinced that this was a murder,\" said McCarthy.",
      "The detectives showed her a video of Tracy Peck fan firing the gun.",
      "\"I think she was certainly surprised when we explained to her how difficult it would be,\" McCarthy said. \"I could tell the light bulb went on in her brain.  And she said... I gotta at least change the story a little bit.\"",
      "Linda now said she and her husband had practiced fan firing with an unloaded revolver for years:",
      "Linda Duffey to police:  Maybe like, yeah, 15, 20 times.",
      "Asked if he believed her this time, McCarthy told Schlesinger, \"No.\"",
      "But the detectives wanted to give Linda one last chance to show them how she fired the gun. They made her an unusual offer.",
      "\"Meet us at the range.  We'll bring an exact replica and show us how you can fire this gun in the manner that you said,\" said McCarthy.",
      "The detectives were certain Linda would not kill again, so they let her go home again and waited to hear from her about their offer. Days turned into weeks, then months, and life went on at the homicide bureau.",
      "\"We changed partners,\" Det. Laren said. \"And when that happens, you start getting new cases. ...And other cases start falling through the wayside.\"",
      "As the years passed, Linda might have thought she was off the hook, but her past was about catch up with her.",
      "\"The district attorney said, 'I'm gonna file this case.  And you need to go get her,'\" said McCarthy.",
      "A NEW LOOK AT THE CASE",
      "With no news for nearly five years, Patrick Duffey's brother, John, and sister, Katherine Hunt, thought the police had decided his death was an accident and had closed the investigation. But Hunt said she had a hard time believing what Linda told her when she called on that awful day.",
      "\"She was incoherent,\" Hunt recalled. \"And I said, 'What happened?'  'He was cleaning his gun, and it accidentally went off.'\"",
      "Linda told police that she had shot Patrick by accident, but later that night she told his siblings he'd shot himself.",
      "\"Could you picture him having that kind of an accident? \" Schlesinger asked Hunt.",
      "\"No, absolutely not,\" she replied. \"We were raised with guns.\"",
      "\"And we were taught to empty our ... weapons before even entering the house.  And that was like the number one rule,\" said John Duffey.",
      "\"It was hard to believe that he had done something like that,\" said Hunt.",
      "And Hunt learned she was right the day after Patrick died, when she met Linda at the funeral home.",
      "\"I said, 'Where was he shot?'  And she went like this. Just like that,\" she said, tapping the top of her head. \"That's when it hit me that he didn't shoot himself...  I said, 'So tell me what really happened' ... she said, 'Oh, you're gonna hate me, you're gonna hate me.' ... I said, 'No, I'm not gonna hate you, but I need to know what the truth is.' ...And I said, 'Did you shoot my brother in the head?' And she said, 'Yes.'\"",
      "It was there, in the funeral home where Hunt first heard the tale of Elmer Fudd.",
      "\"Pat had told her, 'No bullets.'  Like, 'No buwwets,' like \u2014 like Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd, because they would talk in cartoon characters sometimes,\" Hunted laughed. \"She thought the gun wasn't loaded, and it went off.  ...I couldn't quite understand why she had lied.  If it was an accident, it was an accident. But she had lied to us.\"",
      "But police still had to prove she had lied to them about why she shot him. Detectives had interrogated her twice, and released her twice. The second time they let her go they'd made that unusual offer to meet her at the firing range.",
      "\"We even told her, 'it can be at your convenience,'\" said McCarthy.",
      "They weren't shocked when they didn't hear back from her and several months later they stopped by the Duffey's house and saw a \"For Sale\" sign. Her sons were home.",
      "\"And they said ... 'She's on her honeymoon in Italy,'\" said McCarthy.",
      "Two years after the shooting, Linda Duffey was Linda Gwozdz \u2014 newly married to Lawrence Gwozdz, a world class saxophone player.",
      "\"When we Googled him, he was playing in Carnegie Hall,\" said McCarthy.",
      "And once again when wedding bells rang, so did Julie Prendergast's phone.",
      "\"She asked me would I sing in that wedding. And I said, 'What?'\" Prendergast said. \"'Linda, I'm not coming to your wedding. ...something's not right, surrounding the death of Patrick.'\"",
      "Prendergast said she was uneasy with how Linda just moved on.",
      "\"She dyed her hair blonde.  She was wearing different style of clothes. She seemed to be walking on air, on clouds, like oh, just as happy as can be,\" she said.",
      "A year after shooting her first husband, Linda met Gwozdz online. She moved to Mississippi where her new husband was a music professor. She was out of sight, but for detectives Shannon Laren and Shaun McCarthy, she was not out of mind.",
      "\"Did you forget about this case? Was there a period of time where -\" Schlesinger asked the detectives.",
      "\"Oh, no. Absolutely not,\" Lt. McCarthy replied.",
      "When their workload with their new partners permitted, McCarthy and Laren each turned their attention back to Linda. They wanted to take a new look at the blood evidence with a new expert, Paul Delhauer. He studied the photos and police reports and concluded Linda had to be lying. Based on her statements, police believed Linda was claiming that she had fired quickly and from the same spot.",
      "\"She moved and the \u2014 the relative position of the gun to the head changed,\" said Delhauer.",
      "Standing next to the couch where Duffey died, Delhauer said the blood evidence told him a lot \u2014 especially the tiny stains on Linda's clothing and the walls, called spatter, which he says came from the first shot.",
      "\"The barrel has to be within about three inches of the head in order to produce the spatter,\" he explained.",
      "Delhauer said the second shot created a large pool of blood on the floor \u2014 in the exact spot where Linda said she was standing.",
      "\"...she would've been getting jets of blood hitting her,\" Delhauer pointed out.",
      "Asked if Linda had any blood on her, Laren said, \"Very little. Very, very little.\"",
      "Police thought they now had proof that Linda was lying \u2014 she didn't have enough blood on her after the shooting to support her story. Laren and McCarthy thought they knew what really happened.",
      "\"She took aim, fired one round while he was sleeping ... realized he wasn't dead ... comes back on target, fires the second round, and that's why they're within two inches of each other,\" said McCarthy.",
      "They believe Patrick's death wasn't an accident; it was an execution. By 2012, the new prosecutor assigned to the case was eager to move ahead. And police began talking to Linda's co-workers.",
      "\"Boy, that was very revealing,\" McCarthy said. \"They consistently talked about how ... she was so charming. But then as time went on, they started finding out that she was this compulsive liar.\"",
      "And Julie Prendergast had a few stories to tell about her one-time friend's record when it came to telling the truth.",
      "\"We all have one gallbladder.  Linda had hers removed three times,\" Prendergast said. \"Linda just always needed \u2014 seemed to want to have attention.\"",
      "It was enough for McCarthy. \"I became absolutely convinced that we need to prosecute her,\" he said.",
      "Finally in May 2012, five years after Patrick Duffey's death, Lt. McCarthy flew to Mississippi where Linda and her new husband were living in a comfortable home and she had gotten a job at the university.",
      "\"You knock on the door,\" Schlesinger said to McCarthy. \"What's her reaction?\"",
      "\"Her reaction was ... 'I thought the investigation was all over,'\" he replied.",
      "The investigation wasn't over. McCarthy arrested Linda Duffey Gwozdz for murder.  And everyone was in for some surprises.",
      "LINDA DUFFEY GWOZDZ GOES ON TRIAL",
      "Six years after Linda Duffey shot her husband to death, she thought she was going on with her life with a new husband, a new house, a new look, and a new town. But now, she was going on trial for murder.",
      "\"Unfortunately, on this particular day, she was going to play with the gun again like she'd done so many times before and she rapid fired it into the top of his head.  It was a complete accident,\" said her attorney, Joseph Low.",
      "Low argued that, based partly on the words of Elmer Fudd \u2014 \"No more buwwets\" \u2014 Linda thought the .38 revolver was empty.",
      "\"Did you ever consider the possibility that this \u2014 what we'll call a Bugs Bunny defense, for lack of a better term, could be true?\" Schlesinger asked Prosecutor Attorney Robert Villa.",
      "\"Zero percent chance it's true,\" he replied.",
      "Robert Villa said in 27 years on the job, he's never seen a defense rely even partly on a cartoon.",
      "Watching a prosecutor parrot a bunny was a first for \"48 Hours\" too, but an official transcript of the cartoon had to be made.",
      "\"Bugs is having a conversation with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd,\" Villa explained before reading the transcript. \"'What do you know, no more buwwets.' And then Bugs Bunny says 'No more buwwets?'",
      "\"As they're having this conversation, just as she was about to fan fire the gun, he laid down and put his own head right in front of the gun,\" Villa said of Linda's account. \"It's so ridiculous.\"",
      "\"You know and I know, strange things do happen,\" Schlesinger noted.",
      "\"Strange things happen. This wasn't one of them,\" Villa replied. \"He was asleep. She shot him in the head twice.\"",
      "\"It was that simple, open and shut?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"For me, it was,\" said Villa.",
      "But it wasn't so simple for the jury. Over two weeks they heard three recordings of Linda's statements to authorities about cartoon rabbits and cowboy fan firing. They also heard days of testimony from dueling forensics experts about whether Linda's explanation made any sense at all. It was a lot for the jury to consider.",
      "\"It was difficult,\" juror Brandie Jones said. \"For every expert there's another one who can tell you a different story.\"",
      "The defense questioned whether prosecution expert witness Paul Delhauer was really an expert at all. The jurors deliberated for a day, but could not reach a verdict.",
      "\"Very few of us thought the intent was there,\" Jones said. \"So how do you convict somebody when it could have happened exactly the way she explained it?\"",
      "With a deadlocked jury, the judge had no choice and had to declare a mistrial.",
      "\"It sends a clear message that the jury wasn't willing to convict on murder,\" said defense attorney Joseph Low.",
      "\"Were you disappointed?\" Schlesinger asked Prosecutor Villa.",
      "\"I'm always disappointed when there's no verdict, because that means I have to do it again,\" he replied.",
      "And roughly one year later, with Linda having remained in jail, Villa was doing it again. This time his case would be very different - streamlined and simple.",
      "\"He laid down on the couch,\" Villa addressed the court in his opening. \"His wife came up to him, put a gun between one and seven inches from his head, and pulled the trigger. ...Some time went by. She pulled the trigger again.\"",
      "He said the Duffey's marriage was strained and Linda thought she might have to take care of her ailing husband.",
      "\"She's like, 'I'm not gonna wait on this guy for the rest of his life,'\" Villa told Schlesinger.",
      "\"This was a premeditated and deliberate murder,\" he told the court.",
      "For his opening arguments, defense attorney Joseph Low brought his own sofa to the courtroom to present this as a simple case.",
      "\"No motive, no intent, no crime,\" he told the court. \"Pat was her best friend, and she was his. ... One of the things they loved to do is to watch cartoons together... They were kinda goofy.\"",
      "But there are many aspects to this trial that are, if you will, offbeat.",
      "Judge John Torribio has a reputation for lightening the atmosphere for the jury.",
      "\"One of you asked the clerk about how the cameras work. Well, they're only on me,\" Judge Torribio joked to the jurors, who laughed in response. \"I'm the star, so don't worry.\"",
      "But things quickly got serious when the district attorney took jurors back to the moment right after Linda Duffey shot her husband:",
      "Linda Duffey to 911: My husband was going to go shooting and he was showing me how to use a gun and I shot him. ... He said there were no bullets in the gun! ...I thought that's what he told me.",
      "\"It's hard to make out some of the words 'cause she can't even talk,\" Low told jurors about Lind;a 911 call to police.",
      "\"She sounds terrified and frantic to me. What does she sound like to you?\" Schlesinger asked Villa.",
      "\"She sounds like someone who is acting,\" he replied.",
      "Using the firearm to demonstrate, Tracy Peck told the jury Linda had to pull the trigger on the gun twice to get two bullets to fire.",
      "\"If I do not release the trigger, the cylinder will not advance,\" she testified.",
      "The big surprise in this trial is what prosecutor Robert Villa leaves out.",
      "\"I ask that people's exhibits 1 through 35 be admitted into evidence, and with that I rest,\" he told the court.",
      "\"I rested my case after basically two-and-a-half days,\" he told Schlesinger.",
      "Unlike the first trial, there was very little dense forensic testimony about blood stains and, most crucially, he did not introduce Linda's taped interviews with police, where she first discussed Bugs Bunny.",
      "\"There was no need for Bugs Bunny,\" Schlesinger noted to Villa.",
      "\"No need, unless she took the stand,\" he said.",
      "Villa has thrown defense attorney Joseph Low a curve ball. Since the defense isn't allowed to introduce the police interrogations unless the State does first, the only way jurors will hear Linda's side of the story is if she takes the stand and exposes herself to cross examination.",
      "\"Were you hoping she would take the stand?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Villa replied.",
      "\"Were you ready?\"",
      "\"Absolutely.\"",
      "Low began his defense with a good offense. His first witness was the detective who at first did not think Linda was a murderess:",
      "Joseph Low: When you're done asking her questions, you allowed Mrs. Duffey to go home.",
      "Lt. Shaun McCarthy: Correct.",
      "\"Talking to her ... was very convincing to me,\" McCarthy told Schlesinger. \"She was eccentric and, how could she harm anybody?\"",
      "Joseph Low: You would not let somebody who you thought had just committed a murder go back out on the street ... Isn't that correct, sir?",
      "Robert Villa: Objection, relevance.",
      "Judge Torribio: Sustained.",
      "\"That night I liked her. As the investigation went on, I liked her a lot less,\" said McCarthy.",
      "Low tried to paint a sympathetic picture of Linda by calling her sons to the stand.",
      "\"She's a very emotional, caring person,\" Thomas Duffey testified.",
      "\"We were always really happy,\" Sean Duffey told the court. \"They liked cartoons a lot. They were always making funny jokes to each other ... always poked fun at each other and stuff.\"",
      "The defense has a very big decision to make: will Linda take the stand herself?",
      "\"And if she took the stand, we were gonna hear all about Bugs Bunny,\" said Villa.",
      "Linda decided not to take the stand. Worried that the jury will hear nothing about fan firing, her lawyer comes up with an idea.",
      "\"I'd like to refer the court and counsel to page 5 of the 911 transcript,\" Low addressed the court.",
      "He found a reference to it in the 911 tape prosecutors have already introduced.",
      "\"A long time ago he showed me how to pull the thing back on the top of the gun and pull the trigger it fast,\" the Judge Torribio read aloud.",
      "So Low is allowed to call firearms expert Lance Martini, who said fan firing a double-action gun like Linda claims she did isn't so far-fetched after all.",
      "Lance Martini: This can be done. It's not overly common, but it certainly can be done.",
      "Joseph Low:  Is it humanly possible to shoot more than one round in less than a second? Double-action mode?",
      "Lance Marini: Yes it is.",
      "\"There's no way, absolutely no way that it happened that way,\" Villa told Schlesinger.",
      "In his closing, Villa told jurors, \"This was an execution.\"",
      "The jurors in Linda's second trial never got to see any cartoons, but they did see an animation produced by the prosecutor. It is no laughing matter; it attempts to answer a deadly serious question: what happened to Patrick Duffey?",
      "The video animation of a woman shooting her husband in the head twice doesn't leave much to imagination, although the defense, in closing arguments, said it and the rest of the State's case are all a fantasy.",
      "\"She accidentally shot her husband,\" Low told the court. \"It ain't right, it's not fair to guess somebody into a conviction, guess somebody into a concrete tomb.\"",
      "\"It all comes down to whether it's one word or two words from the jury,\" Schlesinger commented to Villa. \"Guilty or not guilty.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" he replied.",
      "A TALE OF TWO JURIES",
      "It's been a long road - now nearly seven years since Patrick Duffey died and one year after a jury deadlocked in his wife's first murder trial. This time, the jury came back in just over 24 hours:",
      "\"We the jury above and titled action find the defendant Linda Doreen Gwozdz guilty of the crime of second-degree murder...\"",
      "The guilty verdict floored Linda, who collapsed while leaving the courtroom. It hit her lawyer hard, too; he waved off the camera. For his part, the prosecutor is more relieved than anything else.",
      "\"I'm pleased that I don't have to try it a third time,\" Villa said.",
      "\"You saw how she reacted,\" Schlesinger commented to Villa.",
      "\"Yes,\" he said. \"I've always thought she was an actress, so, that was her moment.\"",
      "Patrick Duffey's sister, Katherine Hunt, has waited years for this day.",
      "\"That's the first time I saw her really cry,\" she said following the verdict. \"She didn't get away with murdering my brother.\"",
      "When it came time to sentence Linda three months later, it was her last chance to address the court:",
      "\"I wanted to let all of you know how grieved I feel.  Most of all to Patrick and \u2014 my beautiful sons, Sean and Thomas, because you lost such a loving wonderful father,\" she said.",
      "Her sons try their best to ask for leniency.",
      "\"If there's anything you can do to help out with my family,\" Sean Duffey said in court, \"that's all I can ask.\"",
      "\"I believe she's innocent, and I will until the day I die,\" Thomas Duffey told the judge.",
      "Linda's second husband, Larry Gwozdz, also appealed to the judge.",
      "\"To assert that this was a premeditated purposeful act, I'm sorry. It's unacceptable to me,\" he said.",
      "\"Look at these two people, beautifully in love,\" Gwozdz continued, shakily holding up a photo of himself and Linda. \"Why? Because she's a wonderful human being ... who doesn't deserve this.\"",
      "But the judge doesn't have much leeway.",
      "\"In this particular instance the law mandates 40 to life, and my oath requires that I impose that,\" he said.",
      "\"48 Hours\" found it curious that one jury could not agree on a verdict at all and a second jury convicted Linda in a day. It is ironic, but in these two trials it's apparently true, that, in the case against Linda Duffey Gwozdz, less was more.",
      "\"48 Hours\" sat down with jurors from both trials to see why one jury quickly reached a verdict, while the other never did.",
      "Remember, the jury that convicted Linda only heard the bare bones prosecution \u2014 very little about fan firing or cartoons.",
      "\"They heard a lot more than you heard,\" Schlesinger commented to the jurors from the second trial.",
      "\"And we can only make the decision based off of the evidence that we heard,\" said juror Danielle Wong.",
      "The jurors from both trials \u2014 the ones who heard the long story and the ones who heard it made short \u2014 sat around our table and pondered: while less may be more, is it enough?",
      "\"You're putting a woman away for the rest of her life, so present everything,\" said Brandie Jones, a juror in the first trial, who voted not guilty.",
      "\"I think I really have to agree with Brandie.  Maybe all the evidence should be presented,\" said Wong.",
      "\"Did you know she gave an interview to police?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Uh-uh,\" Wong replied, shaking her head \"no.\"",
      "\"Would you have liked to?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"I would have loved to hear what she had to say. Would that have changed my decision?  Don't know. Possibly,\" Wong replied.",
      "\"If you had heard everything ... do you think it would have affected the deliberations?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Absolutely,\" said Wong.",
      "And even though they made their decision, some of the jurors who convicted Linda still have questions.",
      "\"Did it bother you that they never said exactly why she did it?\" Schlesinger asked.",
      "\"Um, yeah, it did,\" said Wong.",
      "\"How'd you get over that?\"",
      "\"I'm not over it. I still wanna know!\" she replied.",
      "\"When I heard the guilty verdict, I said, 'Yay, justice is finally served,\" said Julie Prendergast.",
      "Prendergast has no doubt the second jury did the right thing by finding her former friend guilty. And she wonders how Linda's life, which was once so happy, became so sad.",
      "\"I'm sad for everyone involved ... Those two boys lost their father. And now, they're losing their mother,\" she said. \"It's a tragic story ... in every way you can think about it.\"",

      "It's a murder case that shook a community and one that hinges on a personal activity tracker and another technology: Google Dashboard, a tool that many people don't even know they have. But could it convict a killer?",
      "Nicole Vander Heyden went out with friends for a night on the town in Green Bay, Wis., on May 20, 2016. She never made it home. A day later, she was found dead in a field, having been beaten and strangled to death.",
      "The murder left her friends and family shaken, and the community wondered how it could happen. At the time, Vander Heyden was living with her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, and their 6-month-old son. Detrie was interviewed by sheriff's deputies and quickly became the prime suspect when blood was found on the floor of their garage and in Vander Heyden's car.",
      "Investigators also wondered why Detrie waited hours before reporting her missing. \"It doesn't seem like a guy who's particularly worried about his girlfriend, the mother of his child, does it?\" Slinger tells \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty.",
      "Detrie was wearing a Fitbit device when he was interviewed and when he was arrested. Data recorded about his activities during the window of time Vander Heyden was murdered told a very different story \u2013 one that cleared him. He was released 18 days after his arrest.",
      "Over the next several months, Nicole's clothing and items at the murder scene were processed for DNA. That would lead investigators in yet another direction \u2013 and to another man.",
      "\"Nobody knew who he was,\" says Kate Briquelet, a writer for the Daily Beast and a native Wisconsinite. \"He had no connection to Nikki, no connection to Doug, no connection to any of their friends. I mean, he was literally a mystery man.\"",

      "In February 2018, friends and family of Nicole Vander Heyden gather in a packed Brown County courtroom, seeking justice for her brutal, senseless murder, two years earlier.",

      "Tiffany Hoffman: Light.\u00a0 Spirit.\u00a0 A verve and a zest and zeal. \u2026 She was close with her family, and loved her children.",
      "Nikki was a mom to three: Mikayla and Tyler from a previous marriage, and 6-month-old Dylan, whose father was her boyfriend, Doug Detrie.",
      "The two had met in January 2015, and soon moved in together.",
      "Tiffany Hoffman: She was really, really happy. \u00a0 When she talked to me, she said they both were excited. Yeah, they both were excited to have a baby.",

      "As the concert is ending, Nikki decides to go with his friends to another bar, called the Sardine Can.",
      "Erin Moriarty:\u00a0 And leave him.",
      "Kate Briquelet:\u00a0 Doug agreed that he would \u2026 finish his conversation that he was having and find her at the next bar.",

      "But as the night wears on, and Detrie still hasn't shown up at the Sardine Can, Nicole gets upset and begins sending him angry texts.",
      "Kate Briquelet:\u00a0 They were scorching. And they were all but accusing him of infidelity.",
      "Sometime after 11:30 p.m., Nikki tries calling Detrie, but he doesn't answer.",
      "Kate Briquelet: So another friend calls Doug, and he answers. And this enrages Nikki.",
      "So she gets up and leaves the bar.",
      "One of Detrie's friends runs after her, begging her to come back to the bar.\u00a0 But she refuses.\u00a0 Instead, Nicole walks up the street, turns left, and vanishes into the night.",

      "They also discover a pair of Air Jordan's in the garage that appear to match the shoe print found on Nikki's back, and seem to have blood smudges on the bottom.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: For us, it's adding up. OK. This \u2014 this is our guy.",

      "Erin Moriarty: And what was found here?",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: A large quantity of blood that was determined to be Nicole's as well as some clumps of blonde hair \u2026 And, then, there was also a cord which I would describe as, a phone \u2026 charging cord.",
      "Kate Briquelet:\u00a0This was a huge discovery for police. \u2026 Now they had a murder scene. And it was 118 feet from Detrie's front door.",
      "More than70 pieces of evidence are sent to the state crime lab. Now detectives had a theory about how Nikki had died.",

      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: We had nothing on Doug. So he was released.",
      "What's more, on the night Nicole disappeared, Doug just happened to be wearing a Fitbit \u2013 a personal tracking device.\u00a0 It goes on your wrist, like a watch, and it tracks your activities:\u00a0 the steps you take, your heart rate, even your sleeping patterns.",

      "Remember, the evidence appears to clear Doug Detrie, so in June of 2016, his focus turns to raising his son Dylan, while Nicole's two older children live with their father.",

      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: We needed to figure out how Nicole got home.",

      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: I'll be honest with you, it was getting to the point we worried it was going to become a cold case.",
      "Their first big break comes over the course of the summer. DNA results trickle in \u2014 and they are tantalizing.\u00a0 The officers learn that many of the samples taken from Nicole's clothing and from the neighbor's yard have DNA from an unidentified man. On dozens of samples, the same partial profile \u2014 but never enough for a positive ID.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: We had this one consistent mystery guy, I guess you'd call it. \u2026 And our job was to try and find out who that was.",
      "Kate Briquelet: It was just a very confusing time. Nobody knew who would have done this to Nikki.",
      "And then finally, that August, almost three months after Nicole disappeared, the officers get a call from the crime lab.\u00a0 One of the socks Nicole had been wearing has enough DNA to run through the national database \u2013 and they get a name.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: The excitement was amazing.",
      "The DNA belongs to a man named George Steven Burch.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: It was a hit out of the state of Virginia.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Virginia?",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: Yeah. Virginia.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: So it was like, OK, who is \u2014 who is George Burch? And \u2014 and why is he in Green Bay, Wisconsin, of all places?",
      "Sgt. Rick Loppnow: Yes. We have a name now. But, now, we need to start digging on who this person is.",
      "Burch moved from Virginia to Green Bay on March 1, 2016, looking for a fresh start.\u00a0 A longtime friend gave him a place to stay and helped him get a job.\u00a0 He also loaned Burch a car \u2014 a red, Chevy blazer.",
      "That red Blazer would provide crucial evidence.\u00a0 It had been involved in a hit-and-run accident and destroyed in a fire a few weeks after Nicole's death. So when detectives run Burch's name through the local police database, up pops the accident report, which leads them to an address \u2013 for George Burch.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: First time I drove by the house, there he is standing outside in front of the house smoking a cigarette. And my \u2014 my hair stood up on the back of my neck. I had goose bumps. It was like, \"Oh my God, there's our guy.\"",
      "They videotape his movements and keep their suspicions to themselves. And they learn that when Burch was questioned about the hit-and-run, he handed over his cellphone. And on it, a high-tech treasure trove.",
      "Kate Briquelet: He gave them consent to search his phone. They extracted the entire thing.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: So I requested a copy of that. \u2026It's an Android phone. [It] had \u2014 a Gmail account associated with it. We were recently made aware of this Google Dashboard data that could, potentially, give us GPS data.",
      "Most people aren't aware, Google Dashboard is a program that combines cellphone tower data, local Wi-Fi hot spots and GPS locators to calculate the actual location of the phone \u2014 at any given time.",
      "The officers subpoena Google for the contents of George Burch's phone. What they get back is astonishing. Burch apparently spent much of the night Nicole disappeared at Richard Craniums, a bar a half-mile from the Sardine Can.",
      "The data tracks Burch at 2:30 a.m. leaving Richard Craniums, and driving to Nicole's house \u2014 the crime scene \u2014 where he stayed for nearly an hour.",
      "Sgt. Rick Loppnow: \u2026 it was very obvious that here's our guy.",
      "He is next tracked at the field where Nicole's body was found, then near the off-ramp where her bloody clothes were discarded, and then, at 4:22 a.m., back at his home.",
      "Erin Moriarty: When you saw that he was right there, what \u2014 what was your reaction?",

      "George Burch: I told you before and I will say it one more time for you sir.\u00a0 I was carrying her over to this area \u2026",
      "Shawna Stowe: I think it was a big turn when you saw him lose his temper.",
      "Carla Rhoads: And I think we both said, \"Well, there's the real Steve Burch coming out \u2013 not George.\u00a0 Not Big Country.\u00a0 This is how we knew him.",

      "George Burch: I wouldn't say not a care in the world. That would definitely not be something I would say.",
      "WHO WILL THE JURY BELIEVE?",
      "The prosecution got one last chance to present witnesses to rebut the story George Burch told the jury.",
      "Sgt. Rick Loppnow: During George Burch's testimony he specifically said, I recall, that they were having sex, her pants were off already at that point. So during the rebuttal, we brought those pants to enter into evidence and make sure they were viewed.",
      "Prosecutor David Lasee: If she had been disrobed in her car, how do those clothes get not just bloody, but dirty and hairy? Those clothes are filthy. And they're demonstrative of being worn during a struggle.",
      "Carefully and respectfully, Sgts. Brian Slinger and Rick Loppnow unwrapped and displayed the pants that Nicole wore the night she died found blood soaked and muddy on the highway.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: It goes to George's credibility, which is zero, that this was not a consensual act \u2026 She fought, escaped the vehicle \u2026 he bludgeoned her, strangled her with her clothes on, and then transported her body to the scene \u2026 His story was a lie \u2026 he disrobed her at the scene and forgot her socks.",
      "And then the final arguments: the prosecution reminded the jurors of the weight of evidence against George Burch.",
      "Prosecutor Mary Kerrigan-Mares: Whose DNA is on her sock? \u2026 Who is with Nikki at the four key areas of Brown County?\u00a0 \u2026 Their explanation is ridiculous and it's insulting to your intelligence.",
      "While the defense hoped to plant doubt.",
      "Defense attorney Lee Schuchart: Justice for Nicole is not going to be delivered by a wrongful conviction of George Burch. Doug Detrie had the motive, the opportunity and the connection to this crime.",
      "Prosecutor David Lasee: The man that met this woman in a bar, and admitted by his own account to dumping her body in that field, looks like this the next day [shows photos of Burch fishing]. Who does that?",
      "Erin Moriarty: What was the feeling in the courtroom as the case went to the jury?",
      "Kate Briquelet: It was very tense \u2026 And I was surprised that, I think, 45 minutes later, I mean not even an hour later, the jury had a question.",
      "The jury asked to see the bloody wire used to strangle Nicole, as well as cords found in Doug Detrie's garage, to see if they were possibly a match.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: You know, the fact that they're thinking about that is telling me, 'OK, are they actually believing George Burch's story here?\"",
      "Kate Briquelet: It really made me wonder where this was gonna go.",
      "After a nine-day trial and more than 50 witnesses, the jury took just over three hours to reach a verdict.",
      "Shayna Stowe: I just had this horrible feeling it was coming back not guilty \u2026 It just was really hard. I could not breathe.",
      "Carla Rhoads: And you could feel everybody was, like, shaking.",
      "Judge: We the jury find the defendant, George Steven Burch, guilty of first-degree intentional homicide",
      "Vicki Meyer: Everybody was just like \u2026 Just thank God that he was guilty. Thank God.",
      "Sgt. Rick Loppnow: What sticks out in my mind was the gasp \u2026 hearing that from the family and knowing the relief that they had at that moment \u2013 that'll stick with me.",
      "Erin Moriarty: In a good way \u2014",
      "Sgt. Rick Loppnow [emotional]: Absolutely.",
      "Shayna Stowe: I know Joey was there for this \u2026 It was his 20-year anniversary of his death in October. It's just \u2014 trying not to get upset.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Could you see Doug Detrie?",
      "Kate Briquelet: Doug Detrie, I think, was relieved. Doug Detrie was holding his mother.\u00a0 \u2026 Doug wasn't even on trial in this case, but he was finally free of any suspicion.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So what you found from this case is that this technology can do more than connect someone to a crime, it can actually exonerate a person.",
      "Sgt. Brian Slinger: Absolutely, yeah. \u2026I feel bad that he sat in jail for 18, 19 days. \u2026 I mean, technology is very important and our goal is to exonerate people just as it is to find them guilty.",
      "Kate Briquelet: If we didn't have these Google data locations on George's phone, if we didn't have the Fitbit \u2026 Would it be Doug Detrie sitting in prison as opposed to George Burch?",
      "Back in court two months after the verdict, the judge speaks to George Burch before sentencing him, while Doug Detrie and his mother look on.",
      "Judge: ... this family is destroyed and will never be like this again. This is a crime that would, I believe, merit the death penalty and for that you have to die in prison.",
      "In a state with no death penalty, the sentence is as harsh as possible: life without parole.",
      "It is what the families wanted, and yet, this is not a time for celebration.",
      "The only comfort for Nicole's family is that George Burch can never destroy lives again.",
      "Brandon Meyer: When they convicted George\u00a0 \u2026 It was a feeling of happiness, but yet still, like, somewhat of a realization that she's actually gone now. And it's hard.",

    "story": [
      "A vehicle rammed into a crowd of people waiting to enter a nightclub along busy Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles early Saturday, injuring 30 people, in what police say appears to be an intentional act.",
      "Victims were transported to local hospitals and trauma centers, according to Capt. Adam Van Gerpen, public information officer for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. At least seven were in critical condition after being injured outside the East Hollywood club, the fire department said.",
      "The situation unfolded around 2 a.m. local time on Saturday when Rampart Patrol officers responded to a radio call regarding an assault with a deadly weapon in the area of Vermont Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard.",
      "The Los Angeles Police Department says they are investigating the crash as an intentional act, saying the driver, later identified by police as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, made a U-turn before slamming into the crowd. Police say that following the crash, bystanders removed the driver from the vehicle and attacked him. When officers arrived, they discovered the driver had been shot at some point. Ramirez was transported to an area hospital, where he is undergoing surgery, the LAPD said.",
      "Police Saturday night said Ramirez had been arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, police said. It was unclear if he had been booked into jail or remained hospitalized, or what condition he was in.",
      "According to the LAPD, the suspect who shot the driver fled the scene on foot and was last seen heading westbound from Vermont Avenue. He is being described as a Hispanic man who is about 5 feet 9 inches tall, 180 pounds, bald, wearing a blue jersey and possibly armed with a silver revolver. The LAPD said it is investigating the shooting as a crime.",
      "Van Gerpen said that a line of people \u2014 the majority female \u2014 were waiting to enter a nightclub when they were struck by a Nissan Versa that also hit a taco truck and valet stand. The club, Vermont Hollywood, was hosting a reggae/hip hop event from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m., according to its online calendar.",
      "A fight had broken out outside of the club prior to the incident, Maria Medrano told the Associated Press. Medrano and her husband were both selling hot dogs outside the venue.",
      "Shortly after, the car hit a group of people standing outside, Medrano said. The car also struck their stand, Medrano told the Associated Press. She and her husband narrowly escaped.",
      "\"The car stopped once it hit the hot dog stand, it got stuck there,\" Medrano told The Associated Press from the hospital. \"If not, I wouldn't be here to tell (the story).\"",
      "Medrano said she heard what appeared to be gunshots after the crash.",
      "\"Everyone started running,\" she said.",
      "A witness who was standing outside the club when the crash happened describes the chaos.",
      "\"We heard a loud bang and we all started ducking, we think it's gunshots,\" he said. \"We are in disbelief because 20 seconds more that would have been us.\"",
      "People inside the club came out to help in the minutes before emergency crews arrived, Van Gerpen said, to help the victims.",
      "Los Angeles City Fire says a total of 124 firefighters responded to the scene, where they set up a large triage area outside the club.

    "published": "Sat, 19 Jul 2025 21:22:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Authorities determined that three people are still missing from the floods, a sharp drop from the approximately 100 people authorities had previously said were unaccounted for.",
    "story": [
      "The number of people missing in Texas Hill Country following the deadly flooding which struck the region over the Fourth of July holiday weekend has plummeted significantly, officials announced Saturday.",
      "The Kerr County Flood Disaster Joint Information Center determined that three people are still missing from the floods, the city of Kerrville said in a news release. That is a sharp drop from the approximately 100 people authorities had previously said were unaccounted for.",
      "\"Through extensive follow-up work among state and local agencies, many individuals who were initially reported as missing have been verified as safe and removed from the list,\" the city said in its news release. \"This has been an ongoing effort as investigators worked diligently to verify reports of missing persons and confirm their status.\"",
      "Kerrville is the county seat of Kerr County, which was hard-hit by the historic flooding. It is located about 60 miles northwest of San Antonio.",
      "\"We are profoundly grateful to the more than 1,000 local, state, and federal authorities who have worked tirelessly in the wake of the devastating flood that struck our community,\" Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said in a statement. \"Thanks to their extraordinary efforts, the number of individuals previously listed as missing has dropped from over 160 to three.\"",
      "Recovery efforts for those missing are continuing along the Guadalupe River watershed, officials added, with local, state, federal and international search and rescue teams involved.",
      "The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. The Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "Earlier this week, state officials reduced the number of people unaccounted for from approximately 160 to about 100 in Kerr and other counties. State, federal and international resources were poured into rescue efforts, which were hindered by more rain in mid-July.",
      "Kerr County officials also said earlier this week the number of missing people decreased as victims were recovered, contact was made with people who were found safe, and some reports were found to be unsubstantiated or falsified. Also, they said, the missing list fluctuates as reports come into a hotline.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country. Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, and Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe. At least 27 of its campers and counselors died. Many of the campers who died were the camp's youngest attendees.",
      "The Texas Legislature is scheduled to convene Monday for a special session. Gov. Greg Abbott initially called lawmakers back to the Texas State Capitol in Austin hoping legislators would pass a measure to regulate a booming business in THC products after he vetoed a bill that would have banned them. Since the flooding, President Donald Trump has also told the Republicans who control state government to redraw congressional districts to help the GOP's chances of retaining a U.S. House majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Now, Abbott and other legislative leaders have added flooding-related issues to the agenda. Abbott said lawmakers would also review authorities' handling of the flooding and consider improving warning systems for Hill Country residents. Kerr County does not have a warning system because state and local agencies missed opportunities over the past decade to finance one.",
      "Trump and Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding. The president, who visited the area on July 11, called a reporter \"evil\" for raising such issues and said he thought \"everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances.\" Abbott dismissed a question about who was to blame for the deaths as \"the word choice of losers\" and used an analogy that began: \"Every football team makes mistakes.\"",
      "\"The way winners talk is not to point fingers,\" he concluded.",
      "Abbott has designated bills dealing with early warning systems and emergency communications as priorities for the Legislature's special session, scheduled to last 30 days.",
      "The House and Senate have formed special committees on flooding and disaster preparedness, and they're planning a July 31 visit to Kerrville, the seat of hardest-hit Kerr County, to hear comments from residents.",
      "The committees are scheduled to begin with a joint hearing Wednesday to consider the state's response to the fatal floods; planning for floods; infrastructure for managing floods; and communications among first responders. Washington senator Maria Cantwell said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there is a \"national responsibility\" for the federal government to\u00a0improve forecasting systems.",
      "One bill already introduced by Republican Rep. Don McLaughlin would require the state's top public health official to set building standards for youth camps in 100-year floodplains \u2014 which FEMA defines as a high-risk area with a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "During a recent news conference, Republican state Rep. Drew Darby, a member of the House's committee, said lawmakers cannot bring back flood victims or undo the flooding.",
      "\"But what we can do is learn from it,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday filed a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal's publisher and its leader, Rupert Murdoch, after the paper published a story on what it called a \"bawdy\" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein that the paper alleged was signed by Mr. Trump.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, includes two counts of defamation each seeking at least $10 billion in damages, for a total of at least $20 billion. The lawsuit alleges the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging,\" and accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures.\"",
      "The paper claimed the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "The president has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein years ago, but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The suit names the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, along with its parent company, News Corporation. Also named in the lawsuit as defendants are Wall Street Journal reporters Joseph Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar, the bylines on the Epstein story, as well as Murdoch and Dow Jones CEO Robert Thomson.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump referred to it as a \"POWERHOUSE Lawsuit\" and a \"historic legal action.\"",
      "A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "Defamation lawsuits face a high bar to success in U.S. courts. Typically, for a public figure to win a defamation suit, they need to demonstrate not only that false claims were made about them, but also that the defendant acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning that they knew the claims were false or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "Facing pressure to disclose more details on Epstein, who died in his jail cell in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges, Mr. Trump on Thursday ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Epstein. The Justice Department late Friday filed a motion to unseal that grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",

      "The army, which is not at the sites but secures them from a distance, says it only fires warning shots if crowds get too close to its forces.",
      "The GHF, which employs private armed guards, says there have been no deadly shootings at its sites, though this week, 20 people were killed at one of its locations, most of them in a stampede. The group accused Hamas agitators of causing a panic, but gave no evidence to back the claim.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there were no incidents at or near its sites. It said the reported Israeli shootings occurred far from the sites and hours before they opened. \"We have repeatedly warned aid seekers not to travel to our sites overnight and early morning hours,\" it said.",
      "The Israeli military said it had fired \"warning shots\" near Rafah after a group of suspects approached troops and ignored calls to keep their distance. It said it was investigating reports of casualties, but noted the incident occurred overnight when the distribution site was closed.",

      "Most of Saturday's deaths occurred as Palestinians massed in the Teina area, around two miles away from a GHF aid distribution center east of the city of Khan Younis.",

      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",

      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed during their escape, and two drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service. The city of San Francisco benefits indirectly through spending at hotels, restaurants, shops, and local tourism businesses.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

      "Before the Senate voted early Thursday morning to pass a rescissions package that includes major cuts to public broadcasting, National Public Radio President and CEO Katherine Maher warned, \"defunding this is a real risk to the public safety of the country.\"",
      "\"Public media, public radio, public television, are a critical part of the emergency response plans of nearly half of the states in this nation,\" Maher said in an interview with CBS News. \"If these types of emergency alerting go away, you will have fewer outlets to be able to respond in real time\" to future natural disasters.",
      "In June, the White House asked Congress to cancel $9.4 billion in appropriations that had previously been approved. The request, known as the rescissions package, passed in the House in mid-June and would cut roughly $8 billion from international assistance, including organizations like the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The Senate added an amendment to exempt $400 million in global health funding for PEPFAR, a program started during the Bush administration to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries.",
      "The revised package passed by a vote of 51-48, with Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski joining Democrats in voting against it.",
      "\"My obligation is to my constituents and to the Constitution,\" Murkowski told reporters after voting against an earlier procedural vote\u00a0Tuesday. \"So I look at the Constitution and say that it is \u2026 the legislative branch that has the power of the purse. I take that charge personally, and so I'm going to execute on it.\"",
      "In addition to the foreign assistance cuts, the package includes $1.1 billion in reductions for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds 1,500 local public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "The legislation follows an executive order by President Trump in May directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Board to cease federal funding for NPR and PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, alleging partisan bias.",
      "\"Neither entity presents a fair, accurate or unbiased portrayal of current events to taxpaying citizens,\" the order stated.",
      "Maher previously testified before a House subcommittee in March alongside PBS CEO Paula Kerger, where they defended their organizations from the accusations of bias. In her interview this week, Maher reiterated that NPR prioritizes stories that \"directly speak to Americans' political interests and changing beliefs.\"",
      "\"I take all criticism seriously, as I think any news organization should,\" Maher said. \"And if there's a perception that we are not serving the full range of American political life, well we need to, we need to respond to that.\"",
      "Ahead of a Friday deadline, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to support the clawbacks or risk losing his support.",
      "\"It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post this month, using a nickname designed to mock MSNBC. \"Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican senators have voiced concerns about cuts to public broadcasting, especially for those serving rural and Native communities. During Wednesday's vote-a-rama, Sen. Maria Cantwell warned that eliminating funding for CPB could endanger those who rely on radio for emergency information.",
      "\"We're not just putting PBS at risk here, we're putting millions of Americans who depend on local media for life-saving information [at risk],\" Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said in a floor speech. \"And what's in this rescission request is really making sure that public broadcasters don't have that ability, at least in 20 states where they have emergency plans.\"",
      "South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds, a GOP holdout who initially expressed skepticism about the rescissions package, said this week he intends to support it after working with the White House to reallocate unused funding through the Department of the Interior to tribal stations.",
      "\"It will keep them in operation. It will be for one year at a time,\" Rounds said.",
      "The rescissions package comes on the heels of the devastating July 4 floods on Texas' Guadalupe River, which left more than 130 dead and search efforts are still ongoing for more than 100 still unaccounted for.",
      "Since the tragedy, there have been questions about the efficiency of emergency alert systems \u2014 many of which, Maher said, rely on public broadcasting.",
      "Maher said communities in rural areas like that would feel the largest impacts of the funding cuts. She said some NPR stations receive \"more than 50% of their budget\" from federal funds and could face tough decisions, from staffing layoffs to potential station closures.",
      "WDIY, a public radio station in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, has a mix of news and musical programming that is produced by a staff of four along with a host of community volunteers. About 15% of its overall budget comes from CPB funding.",
      "\"Losing that money would mean that we would have to make some serious decisions about do we carry NPR programming anymore because that money helps us pay for that programming,\"\u00a0 WDIY Executive Director Margaret McConnell told CBS News.",
      "Without those smaller stations producing area-specific news and media, Maher cautioned it could become more difficult for such communities to receive information usually provided through local radio.",
      "\"We lose something fundamental as a nation if public media goes away,\" said Maher.",

      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

      "In May, the Supreme Court extended a pause on deportations of Venezuelan migrants detained in northern Texas while they challenge their removals under the wartime law.",
      "Some of the families of the Venezuelan deportees have denied that they have gang connections, and a \"60 Minutes\" investigation in April found that most of the detainees did not have criminal convictions.",
      "The Venezuelan government confirmed Friday's swap, saying in a statement it \"has achieved the release of the 252 Venezuelan citizens who remained kidnapped and subjected to forced disappearance in a concentration camp, known as CECOT, in the Republic of El Salvador.\"",
      "Officials describe \"down-to-the-wire\" deal",
      "A senior administration official said the deal with El Salvador and Venezuela was \"essentially down to the wire.\" The flight carrying the detainees took off from Venezuela at around 3:40 p.m. ET and left Venezuelan airspace at around 3:55 p.m. The official alleged the Venezuelan government took \"one last stand\" by briefly delaying Friday's swap as a \"power flex.\"",
      "The prisoner swap was arranged as Venezuela faces intense U.S. sanctions that limit the country's once-lucrative oil industry, and came one day after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on six leaders and affiliates of Tren de Aragua. A senior administration official said Friday's deal was \"humanitarian in nature\" and there was \"not a discussion of sanctions whatsoever.\"",
      "Rubio credited Bukele \u2014 who has cast himself as a key ally in Mr. Trump's deportation push \u2014 for the swap. Bukele posted on X that his government initially proposed the swap to Venezuela's government in April.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",
      "Responding to that report, a YouTube representative said the platform \"continually works with mental health experts to refine [its] approach to content recommendations for teens.\"",

    "summary": "Philippa Langley, who helped unearth King Richard III's body from a parking lot in 2012, says that two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London were not killed.",
    "story": [
      "It is one of history's most intriguing \"murders\" \u2014 the mysterious disappearance over five centuries ago of two young princes from the Tower of London.",
      "Nearly 200 years after they disappeared, two small skeletons were found in a wooden box at the historic tower and reburied at Westminster Abbey.",
      "The remains were believed, but never proved, to be those of the two brothers \u2014 heir to the throne Edward, 12, and Richard, 9, the sons of King Edward IV of England, who were reputedly murdered at the behest of their uncle, Richard Duke of Gloucester.",
      "William Shakespeare later immortalized him in Richard III as a scheming hunchback who did away with his royal nephews so he could take the crown himself, sealing his reputation as a child killer.",
      "Now British author Philippa Langley, who helped unearth Richard's body from a central England parking lot in 2012, has claimed that the princes \u2014 far from being killed \u2014 actually survived.",
      "The elder prince, Edward, was heir to the throne at the time of his disappearance and would have ruled as King Edward V of England.",
      "Langley decided to delve into the mystery after coming to believe that the conventional narrative in which Richard had the young princes killed smacked of \"history being written by the victors.\"",
      "She was finally spurred into action after reading an article about Richard's reburial at Leicester Cathedral in 2015 which questioned whether the nation should honor a \"child killer.\"",
      "\"I think I'd always realized that the story sort of developed during the reign of the Tudors,\" she said, adding that it was then \"repeated and repeated over time\" until it became \"truth and fact.\"",
      "Historical \"whodunnit\"",
      "The last English king to die in battle, Richard ruled from 1483 until his brutal death at the Battle of Bosworth near Leicester in 1485, aged 32.",
      "Bosworth was the last major conflict in the Wars of the Roses and changed the course of English history because the Tudor dynasty of Henry VII captured the crown from Richard's Plantagenets.",
      "Langley attributes the accepted story that Richard had the boys murdered to King Henry VII, a \"very, very intelligent individual, but suspicious and highly paranoid.\"",
      "\"He had a massive spy network working for him. And he was able to completely control the narrative,\" she said, adding that Richard ended up \"covered in Tudor mud.\"",
      "Taking a cold case review approach to the historical \"whodunnit,\" Langley says she assembled a group of investigative specialists, including police and lawyers, to advise her.",
      "\"They said: 'Look, if you haven't got any confirmed, identified bodies, then it has to be a missing persons investigation and you have to follow that methodology.' They said: 'You have to actively look for evidence,'\" Langley said. \"That's when it really started to get interesting.\"",
      "Langley put out an appeal for volunteers to scour archives and was inundated with offers of help from people ranging from ordinary citizens to medieval historians.",
      "The result was the decade-long Missing Princes Project, which she says unearthed a significant amount of information pointing to the survival of both young princes.",
      "\"History's greatest cold case\"",
      "Langley now believes that it is up to Richard's detractors to disprove the survival thesis, which she outlines in the new book \"The Princes in the Tower: How History's Greatest Cold Case Was Solved.\"",
      "\"The onus is now on them to find the evidence that the boys died,\" she said. \"They cannot say Richard III murdered the princes in the tower any more because we found numerous proofs of life everywhere.\"",
      "Key to Langley's conviction that both boys survived are documents discovered supporting a rebellion by \"Edward IV's son.\"",
      "During the rebellion in 1487, Lambert Simnel, a pretender to the throne who came forward after Richard's death, was crowned in Dublin.",
      "According to fresh references found by the project, the boy was \"called\" or said to be \"a son of King Edward,\" which she believes points to Simnel being the elder prince, son of Edward IV.",
      "The reaction to Langley's research has been mixed.",
      "Michael Dobson, director and a professor of Shakespeare studies at the University of Birmingham's Shakespeare Institute, expressed skepticism.",
      "\"Given the ways of dynastic monarchy, I think Richard would have been taking a very big risk in leaving those princes alive,\" he said. \"The chances of their having accidentally gone missing while incarcerated on his orders in the Tower of London seem pretty remote.\"",
      "Langley, a mother of two, initially became interested in Richard III in 1998 after reading a biography that questioned the Shakespearean portrayal of him, the BBC reported.",
      "She authored the book\u00a0\"The Lost King: The Search for Richard III,\"\u00a0co-written with Michael Jones, which chronicles her search for Richard III's lost remains.",
      "The book was turned into a movie, starring Sally Hawkins as Langley and Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the film, as her husband. The film was released in October 2022 after premiering at the\u00a0Toronto Film Festival\u00a0in September 2022.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The day Israeli-American hostage Keith Siegel was freed after nearly 16 months of captivity at the hands of Hamas terrorists in Gaza, he tells CBS News that he denied one final demand by his captors.",
      "\"I did wave. I didn't say thank you,\" he said in an interview at the Israeli Embassy in London on Thursday, during an event to mark 650 days since the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, when Siegel and 250 others were taken hostage. Siegel, who was released Feb. 1, said his captors told him he should offer them his thanks during the handover, but he declined in a final act of defiance.",
      "His wife Aviva Siegel, sitting by his side during the interview, had words of praise for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. She was also taken captive, but was released after about two months, along with other women and children, under a temporary ceasefire and hostage-for-prisoner exchange deal.",
      "\"Bibi Netanyahu is not a terrorist,\" she said, using a common nickname for the Israeli leader. \"He's a good man with a heart and wants good for his country.\"",
      "The Siegels have become two of Israel's most prominent former hostages, using their freedom to remind the world often of the 50 people still believed to be held captive in Gaza. Netanyahu said earlier this month that 20 of those hostages are still thought to be alive.",
      "The Siegels lived in the progressive-leaning kibbutz Kfar Aza, less than two miles from the Gaza border in southern Israel. Many residents in the area have a history of supporting the peace movement and coexistence with Palestinians.",
      "Keith Siegel has been adamant during indirect Israel-Hamas negotiations, which the U.S. is helping to broker along with Qatar and Egypt, that a new deal \"must be signed.\"",
      "\"I am alive because of President Trump's efforts that secured an agreement, and also the cooperation and the efforts of my government and the mediating countries,\" he told CBS News. \"We are home. We are alive because of agreements that were signed, and another agreement must be signed to get all of the 50 back home as soon as possible.\"",
      "Among the ideas being debated is a controversial proposal floated by Israel's far-right defense minister to move all of Gaza's roughly 2 million residents into a compact, \"humanitarian city\" along the Palestinian territory's southern border with Egypt, from which they would not be permitted to leave.",
      "Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a fierce critic of the Netanyahu government, has drawn parallels to the Nazi horrors perpetrated against Jewish people during WWII, slamming the idea of what he said would be \"a concentration camp\" for Palestinians.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said Friday that more than 58,000 people had been killed in the war. The steadily rising death toll \u2014 which cannot be independently verified as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza \u2014 has led to accusations of a genocide being carried out.",
      "Aviva Siegel, asked if she believed the term was fair to use in relation to Israel's actions in the Gaza Strip, said \"Hamas is responsible\" for everything happening in Gaza, adding: \"They need to release the hostages and let the people free.\"",
      "She told CBS News she often sends text messages to President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and that she believes he is doing his best to get the remaining hostages home.",
      "The Seigels said their next planned overseas trip is to the U.S., to meet with Witkoff and hopefully, Aviva said, with Mr. Trump. She said she loved former President Joe Biden and also wanted to thank him for helping to secure her release during his administration, but added that she believes Mr. Trump may be able to wield even greater influence over matters in the Middle East.",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014 At least 33 people were killed and dozens injured by lightning strikes in the eastern Indian state of Bihar this week, officials said Friday. The deaths occurred as powerful storms and monsoon rains battered the state.",
      "Most of the deaths were reported on Wednesday and Thursday, when intense storms hit at least 10 districts in Bihar. Most of the victims were agricultural workers, including an elderly man killed by a lightning strike in the Nalanda district while he was out with grazing cattle. Two women were seriously injured in the same place and were being treated for burns.",
      "The state government has urged residents to take precautions, including remaining indoors during bad weather. Nitish Kumar, Bihar's Chief Minister, announced government compensation of 4 million Indian rupees (about $4,600) for the families of those killed.",
      "The storms and lightning are likely to continue, as monsoon rains are expected to continue for weeks in the region. India's Meteorological Department has predicted light to heavy rainfall in most parts of the southern and northeastern parts of Bihar until at least July 24.",
      "Lightning strikes are common during monsoon season in north and eastern India. More than 2,500 people in India are struck by lightning every year, according to government data. In Bihar alone, at least 243 people were killed by lightning strikes last year, and 275 died in 2023. In November 2023, lightning strikes during unseasonal rainfall killed 24 people in the western Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "A typical lightning strike packs around 300 million volts of electricity, which is capable of causing instant death or severe burn injuries. Scientists say climate change is leading to increased lightning activity and more intense storms. Rising land and sea surface temperatures mean there is more heat energy to fuel the thunderstorms that causes lightning.",
      "A study by scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, said lightning strikes in the U.S. could increase by 12% for every degree Celsius rise in average temperature. One person was killed and over a dozen others were injured after being struck by lightning in Jackson Township, New Jersey on Wednesday.",
      "India's east and northeast region is also prone to annual flooding that has killed dozens of people and displace hundreds of thousands during monsoon season. The seasonal rains wreaked havoc in southern India last year, too. In July 2024, massive landslides sparked by monsoon rains killed at least 158 people in the southern state of Kerala.",

      "\"There must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act,\" Huckabee said in a social media post. \"Saif was just 20 yrs old.\"",
      "The family of Musallet, whose full name was Saifullah Kamel Musallet, told CBS News on Saturday that he was beaten to death on Friday by Israeli settlers in the West Bank.",
      "In a statement, they said he was killed in a confrontation with settlers while trying to protect his family's land in the town of Sinjil, north of Ramallah, and that the settlers had surrounded him for more than three hours, blocking an ambulance and paramedics from reaching him.",
      "The family's statement said his younger brother carried him to an ambulance after the group cleared, but that Musallet died before he was able to reach the hospital.",

The spokesperson said Israeli authorities had announced the arrest of six people in connection with the incident, but neither the IDF nor Israeli police replied to CBS News' questions about the investigation, and there was no confirmation from Israeli authorities of any arrests. Israeli media reported soon after the incident that six people were detained but later released.",
      "On Friday, a spokesperson for the Israeli police said the police and the IDF were \"currently carrying out a joint investigation regarding the death of a Palestinian-American citizen, alleged to have occurred following a confrontation near Sinjil.\"",
      "The statement said at the time of the incident, \"security forces restored order and made arrests on both sides.\"",
      "\"Although no official report was filed regarding a homicide at the time the claim surfaced, and no access to the body was granted to allow for proper forensic examination or collection of critical evidence, the police and IDF have nonetheless launched a proactive investigation to clarify the circumstances surrounding the circulating allegations.

The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact.

    "summary": "Mental health experts discuss the hidden toll of the Texas floods that victims will face long after emergency crews leave. Dr. Sabrina Browne shares warning signs with parents.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Sabrina Browne, a Texas-based psychiatrist, explains what flood survivors might experience and how to know when it's time to get professional help.",
      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist and assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "TEXAS FLOOD SURVIVORS LOOK FOR GOD IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY",
      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",
      "Browne has unique experience in helping Texas families through tragedy, having supported families in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School.",
      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

      "Researchers at the China Building Materials Academy (CBMA) and their partners designed the material to weigh just 12.5 pounds per cubic foot. That's about one-tenth the weight of standard concrete. Its strength comes from a network of microscopic bubbles, each coated with a special maleated rosin.

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",
      "A China Building Materials Academy researcher at work\u00a0 (CBMA)",
      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong.

      "The serious wildlife threat facing airfields today",
      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",
      "Traditional deterrents, like drones, dogs, falcons and even gas-powered cannons, have been used for years. But wildlife adapts quickly, and these methods don't always keep animals away for long.",

      "How robot coyotes work to scare off birds and animals",
      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter.

      "Google Drive is one of the world's most popular cloud storage services, trusted by millions for its convenience and integration with other Google products.",
      "However, when considering it as a backup solution for your important data, it's essential to weigh both its strengths and limitations. We'll explore the pros and cons of Google Drive, focusing on security, privacy, functionality and its suitability as a backup tool.",

      "16 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED IN MASSIVE DATA BREACH",
      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Security: Strong protections, but user vigilance needed",
      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",
      "If you require higher levels of privacy, you can use additional client-side encryption before uploading files to Google Drive. This ensures that only you hold the decryption keys, further protecting your sensitive information.",
      "Google Drive share settings (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Internet dependency: Plan for offline access",
      "Like most cloud storage solutions, Google Drive relies on an internet connection to sync and access files. However, you can make files available offline using Google Drive's desktop app or by enabling offline mode in your browser. Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",
      "Illustration of devices uploading data to Google Drive in the cloud (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",
      "An image of remote servers (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is Google Drive right for you?",

While it has some limitations as a dedicated backup solution, it remains a reliable choice for everyday file storage, sharing and collaboration. By understanding its strengths and potential risks, and by taking proactive security measures, you can use Google Drive safely and effectively.",
      "If you need advanced backup features or require strict privacy controls, consider supplementing Google Drive with specialized backup software or exploring\u00a0alternative cloud storage providers. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your unique requirements and how you choose to manage your data.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google Drive stands out for its convenience and integration with other Google services. However, it\u2019s important to understand both its benefits and its limitations.

      "What if the answer to cleaner energy was right out on the waves? A new green energy system is set to change how we capture clean power, and it all starts with the ocean. French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Some people point out that wave energy still has its hurdles, like dealing with inconsistent wave patterns and currently lower power output compared to wind or solar farms. Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out.

However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links.

      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",

      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web.

      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/why-you-should-think-twice-before-joining-power-saver-program",
    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:00:42 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse reports on proposed changes to California's electric bills on 'Special Report.'",
      "Power saver programs are utility-sponsored demand response initiatives that help reduce electricity usage during periods of peak demand. These programs typically target central air conditioners (AC) and heat pumps, since cooling equipment drives spikes in summer energy demand. In exchange for incentives such as bill credits or rebates, participating homeowners allow the utility to temporarily adjust or cycle their HVAC systems on hot days.",
      "But it\u2019s not all that straightforward. I recently received an email from Leah, an HVAC professional based in Rio Rancho, New Mexico.",
      "\"I would like to see an article about the push for Smart Thermostats, and the convergence of the utilities' attempts to control air conditioning usage to conserve energy.\"",
      "He pointed to a growing push for smart thermostats and what he sees as an effort by utilities to take more control over air conditioning use, all under the banner of energy conservation.",
      "Let\u2019s discuss the power saver programs in detail, including their pros, cons and everything else you need to know.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM/NEWSLETTER",
      "A smart thermostat (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How power saver programs control your AC",
      "Most residential power saver programs function by temporarily reducing air conditioner usage at participating homes during peak periods (usually summer afternoons). In most cases, the utility installs a control device on the outdoor AC unit\u2019s compressor. During a peak event, a radio signal from the utility will cycle the compressor off and on at set intervals. Legacy programs like Xcel Energy\u2019s Saver\u2019s Switch use this method.",
      "Another method utilities use is controlling thermostats. You\u2019re asked to enroll your Wi-Fi smart thermostat in a bring-your-own-thermostat program. During a demand response event, the utility or program operator remotely raises the thermostat setpoint for a few hours. This causes the AC to run less. Most of these programs allow you to override the change via the thermostat or app; however, emergency events may temporarily disable this option.",
      "Benefits of joining a power saver program",
      "Power saver programs provide several benefits for both participating consumers and the wider community. First, there are bill savings and incentives. Participants receive direct financial rewards, ranging from annual bill credits of up to $40 to up-front enrollment bonuses of $25-$100.",
      "These programs also result in collective demand reduction during peak times, helping prevent grid overloads and blackouts. By coordinating energy reductions across thousands of homes, utilities can avoid firing up expensive peaker plants or purchasing high-priced electricity on the open market.",
      "Reducing peak demand can also help avoid turning on older, more polluting fossil-fuel generators. That means fewer CO\u2082 emissions and lower air pollution on the hottest days, when health risks are already high.",
      "A smart thermostat\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Drawbacks and risks of power saver programs",
      "Despite the benefits, residential power saver programs come with several potential drawbacks and concerns that have been raised by both customers and experts.",
      "\"In New Mexico, where I live and work, our electric utility, PNM, offers a 'Power Saver' program. Customers can opt in to have a box mounted to their condenser, which disrupts the signal between the furnace and the condenser during peak consumption hours, effectively shutting it down,\" Leah tells me.",
      "\"It\u2019s not great for the condenser, and we often get calls from customers who don\u2019t fully understand what they signed up for and are confused when their AC stops working. Now, there\u2019s a push to gain access to Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats to achieve the same goal. They want to control our ACs.\"",
      "Understandably, many people are uncomfortable with utilities taking over their cooling systems, especially in extreme heat. Take the 2022 incident with Xcel Energy in Colorado. During an energy emergency, 22,000 smart thermostat users were temporarily locked out of adjusting their ACs. Many had never experienced a no-override event before and were understandably frustrated. While rare, these incidents raise valid concerns about control and consent.",
      "There are also technical concerns. Frequent short cycling of AC compressors can lead to increased wear and tear. Every startup strains the compressor motor, and repeated on-off cycles within a short period may reduce efficiency or shorten the unit's lifespan, although this depends on the system and the frequency of the events.",
      "HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING",
      "Smart thermostats and utility control: What to know",
      "Some people enrolled in thermostat adjustment programs without realizing it. This leads to confusion and frustration when their air conditioning is unexpectedly limited. Often, this happens because smart thermostats come with default opt-in settings or vague incentive language that can be confusing.",
      "In Texas in 2021, many residents saw their smart thermostats rise above 78\u00b0F during an ERCOT conservation alert. They later found out they had unknowingly agreed to let utilities make temperature adjustments.",
      "Privacy and security concerns with smart thermostats",
      "These programs also raise important data privacy concerns. Wi-Fi-enabled thermostats collect and transmit sensitive information, including occupancy patterns, temperature preferences and when a home is likely unoccupied.",
      "Cybersecurity is another issue. Like any internet-connected device, smart thermostats can be vulnerable to hacking or malicious remote commands. So far, no major breaches have impacted AC demand programs, but privacy advocates say the risks are real and growing.",

      "7 things to do if you're considering power saver programs",
      "Whether you're thinking about signing up or are already enrolled, these steps will help you stay in control, protect your comfort and avoid unwanted surprises:",
      "Before you join any power saver or thermostat program, read the terms completely. Ensure you understand the extent of the utility's control, whether you can override changes and how frequently adjustments may occur. Always choose manual enrollment during smart home app setup instead of letting it enroll you automatically.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Use a Wi-Fi thermostat that makes it easy to override changes during demand response events. Many models let you opt out temporarily or permanently through the app or the device itself. Learn how to do this before a peak event occurs, so you're not caught off guard.",

      "Turn on alerts from your utility so you receive notifications about peak demand events by email, text or app. Check your utility\u2019s website for schedules or forecasts and opt out in advance if needed. Staying informed gives you more control over how your system behaves.",

      "Every tattoo starts with a single black dot. That tiny mark is the base for every design, no matter how complex. And now, thanks to a new AI tattoo machine, that dot is more perfect than ever. Welcome to the future of tattooing.",

      "AI tattoo machine (Blackdot)",
      "What is the Blackdot AI tattoo machine and how does it work?",
      "Blackdot is not just a new tool. It's a complete reimagining of how tattoos are created. This device doesn't look like a traditional tattoo machine. It's a sleek, robotic arm powered by artificial intelligence. It uses computer vision, lasers and a microscope to apply ink with surgical precision. The dots it places are about the size of a human hair. Blackdot is currently in studios like Bang Bang in New York City. It's designed to create ultra-detailed tattoos quickly, cleanly and with less pain than traditional methods. And yes, it still uses real needles and real ink. But the way it works is totally different.",
      "How the AI tattoo machine applies ink with precision",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. It's quiet. It's steady. And according to early users, it hurts a lot less. That's because the machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo.",
      "Once a human operator starts the process, the machine scans your skin. It then gets to work, placing ink with incredible accuracy. (Blackdot)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why tattoo clients might prefer an AI tattoo machine",
      "Let's say you want a custom tattoo from an artist across the country. Normally, you'd need to travel, book months in advance, and hope the artist is available. With Blackdot, you can get that same artwork in your city, without ever meeting the artist in person. The machine can handle everything from ultra-sharp lettering to lifelike portraits. It can even replicate a child's handwriting or a piece of original art down to the tiniest detail. And if you're nervous about pain or needles, this machine might make you more comfortable than a traditional tattoo shop.",
      "How tattoo artists can benefit from AI tattoo machines",
      "Blackdot isn't trying to replace tattoo artists. It's trying to give them more options. Artists can license their work to be used by the machine. They control how many times a design can be tattooed. They approve the final work. And they get paid quickly. This opens up tattooing to painters, illustrators, digital artists, photographers and more. You no longer have to be a tattoo artist to get your work on someone's skin.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why some tattoo artists push back against AI tattoo machines",
      "Of course, not everyone is excited about this change. Some tattoo artists feel like a machine doesn't belong in an industry built on human connection and trust. They say machines can't replace the experience that comes from years of working with different skin types and guiding clients through the emotional side of getting a tattoo. They also worry about losing jobs, or about AI removing the \"soul\" of a hand-drawn tattoo.",
      "Some tattoo artists are exploring AI tattoo machines with curiosity",
      "At the same time, some artists are curious. A few have even tried tattooing side-by-side with the machine to see how it compares. One artist described it like watching a dinosaur stare at a meteor; he didn't think it would take over, but he knew it would change things. And in some cases, artists say the machine handles tedious jobs like fine lettering better than they can.",
      "The future of AI tattoo machines in salons, studios, and beyond",
      "Blackdot has big plans. It's not just focused on tattoo shops. The company wants to put machines in permanent makeup studios, high-end salons, barbershops and fashion stores. It also launched something called the Blackdot Gallery, where people can buy digital tattoo art that can be turned into real tattoos. You can even trade and collect tattoos the way you might trade digital art or collectibles.",
      "The machine goes shallower into the skin than a human artist might. This avoids nerve endings that normally cause pain during a tattoo. (Blackdot)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The AI tattoo machine isn't here to erase tradition. It's here to expand it. It offers new ways to create, new ways to connect, and a more comfortable experience for people who have always wanted a tattoo but held back. But it also raises big questions about what we value in a tattoo. Is it the art itself, or the artist behind it?",

      "What makes this camera so special? It has a massive 3.2-gigapixel sensor made up of 201 individual imaging sensors. Each sensor captures 16-megapixel images, all combined to create incredibly detailed photos. The camera takes quick 15-second exposures every 20 seconds, capturing light from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. This means it can see far beyond what previous telescopes could.",

      "The story behind the camera's creation",
      "The journey started more than 20 years ago, led by the U.S. Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. After sharing early designs in 2015 and assembling the camera by 2020, the final build was completed in early 2025. The camera, roughly the size of a small car and weighing 6,600 pounds, was installed on the Simonyi Survey Telescope in March 2025. This marked a major milestone for the international team involved.",

      "The Rubin Observatory isn't just about pretty pictures. It will collect more data in its first year than all previous optical telescopes combined. Scientists will use this data to study dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the universe but remain mysterious. The observatory will also discover millions of new asteroids and comets, improving our understanding of the solar system and helping with planetary defense.",

Rafferty, a Virginia firefighter who was deployed to hard-hit Kerr County to help with search and recovery efforts, folded it up and took it back to his hotel. He rinsed it off in the bathtub. He worried the drain might clog because of all the filth, tree roots and rocks that came out.",

      "Rafferty is part of a loose network of first responders, volunteers and good Samaritans who have fanned out across the region to help reunite Texans with the cherished belongings, family heirlooms and everyday household knickknacks that were swept away when floods ripped through Kerr County over Fourth of July weekend, killing more than 130 people and leaving at least 100 missing.",
      "This week, NBC News spoke with people in the region about the objects that have turned up in the floods\u2019 aftermath \u2014 and why they matter.

      "While a civil war rages in MAGA world over President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to disavow conspiracies that his most ardent supporters stoked about Epstein being part of a deep state sex trafficking cabal, the women who were victimized by the billionaire say their suffering is being sidelined by raw politics.",
      "Four Epstein victims who spoke with NBC News say the Trump administration should be exposing any powerful men who shared Epstein\u2019s penchant for vulnerable young women, not putting the brakes on any future prosecutions.",
      "\u201cYou never really heal,\u201d said Danielle Bensky, 38, who was a budding ballerina when she said Epstein abused her two decades ago. \u201cAnd with what\u2019s happening now, it feels like we\u2019re being erased. All the brave women who came forward \u2026 all the work that we did to tell the world what happened to us, it\u2019s all being erased.\u201d",
      "The victims spoke with NBC News recently as Trump tried to mollify supporters angered by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s announcement that the \u201cclient list\u201d she claimed to have on her desk did not exist, and that Epstein\u2019s death in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges was a jailhouse suicide and not a murder to silence him, as many believe.",
      "Faced with what critics and allies are calling a severe threat to his presidency, Trump has alternately dismissed the furor as a \u201choax\u201d ginned-up by Democrats and ordered Bondi to release \u201cpertinent\u201d grand jury transcripts and other documents that could shed more light on the scandal.",
      "On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump wrote a bawdy birthday letter for Epstein more than two decades ago. NBC News has not seen the original letter, and Trump has called it \u201ca fake thing.\u201d",
      "Bensky said her heart sank earlier this month when Bondi, who had amplified Trump\u2019s campaign promises to \u201cdemolish the deep state,\u201d released a two-page memo stating there was no evidence of an \u201cincriminating client list\u201d of men who had sex with young women procured by the financier and that her office would not prosecute anyone else in the case.",
      "\u201cI felt a wave of sadness,\u201d Bensky said. \u201cAll those years of trying to gain justice just negated. It was just two pages saying they were done investigating with no details about what happened to all of us. It\u2019s like we never existed.\u201d",
      "For other victims, Epstein\u2019s reappearance in the news is like tearing the scab from a wound.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, trauma is never a one and done,\u201d Epstein victim Teresa J. Helm said by email to NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s complex. It can take a lifetime to repair oneself. Various things can initiate a trauma response, and that\u2019s just daily life.\u201d",
      "Helm, who said she was hired to give Epstein massages and was sexually assaulted by him in the early 2000s, now works with sexual assault victims for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation. She said whatever hope she had for getting a measure of justice is now gone.",
      "\u201cWhen a person\u2019s abuser(s) are repeatedly flashed in view at any given moment, and especially when promises of justice, and promises of structures of power finally being held to account \u2014 to then essentially have the door shut in your face and no longer open for business \u2014 then what?\u201d Helm wrote in her email.",
      "Attorney David Boies represented one of Epstein\u2019s best-known accusers, the late Virginia Giuffre, who claimed in a 2016 deposition that Epstein and his now-imprisoned accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell forced her to have sex with several powerful men, including Prince Andrew.",
      "The British royal acknowledged associating with Epstein and agreed to a settlement with Giuffre but denied the allegations.",
      "Maxwell has filed a petition with the Supreme Court to vacate her 2021 conviction for recruiting and grooming teenage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse.",
      "Boies said Trump, Bondi and others in the administration have only themselves to blame for reviving the Epstein saga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s coming up now because the administration made such a big deal that they were going to release a list of clients and, all of a sudden, they did a 180-turn saying we will not release anything,\u201d Boies said. \u201cIf they never said anything there would have been only middling interest and conspiracy thinking. It\u2019s the inconsistencies that fueled things.\u201d",
      "Boies said that as far as he knows there was no document in the raft of evidence he reviewed that was labelled a \u201cclient list.\u201d",

      "\u201cI get upset when I hear his name,\u201d Arden said of Epstein.",
      "Arden said Epstein had identified himself as a talent scout for Victoria\u2019s Secret and she wanted to meet him. Epstein was a top adviser to former Victoria\u2019s Secret CEO Les Wexner but was not a talent scout for the retailer.",
      "\u201cI really wanted to be in the Victoria\u2019s Secret catalog,\u201d said Arden. \u201cBut then he grabbed me, tried to tear off my clothes, and said he wanted to \u2018manhandle\u2019 me. I ran out of there and he chased after me.\u201d",
      "Arden, who filed a police report after the encounter with Epstein, said she supports Trump but believes \u201cthere\u2019s a cover-up of some kind going on.\u201d",
      "\u201cPam Bondi was saying back in February there was a list and then she said the list was on her desk and now there is no list,\u201d said Arden, who lives in Santa Monica. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want something to come out and I don\u2019t understand why. Maybe the list is more horrifying than we think.\u201d",
      "Another victim, who has spoken publicly about how Maxwell recruited her to give Epstein erotic massages, told NBC News she was \u201cterrified\u201d when Bondi announced there was no \u201cclient list\u201d and that she would not prosecute anyone else.",
      "\u201cIn the past, I was out there talking about what happened, and now I don\u2019t want my name out there in connection with anything to do with Epstein because I\u2019m afraid of what they could do to me and my family,\u201d said the woman, who agreed to speak to NBC News on the condition her name not be used because she fears retribution from the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cI am not surprised Trump is now saying we should stop talking about Epstein,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people are trying to protect themselves.\u201d",
      "Bensky said that what\u2019s happening now is like \u201cGround Hog Day for the #MeToo Movement\u201d and threatens the strides all victims have made in confronting their abusers.",
      "\u201cWe need transparency and accountability for the sake of our daughters and future generations of young girls,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cOf late, I\u2019ve been working with a group of young dancers in Hawaii and I sometimes think about how there are so many girls out there being victimized,\u201d Bensky said. \u201cI find myself thinking, how do I tell my students that the world isn\u2019t always dark and painful?

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has grown weary of defending Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the Justice Department's Jeffery Epstein files and wants her to take responsibility for cleaning up the mess, according to four people familiar with White House deliberations.",
      "\"One thing that's been clear is his feelings about it,\" one White House official told NBC News. \"This now resides within the DOJ.\"",
      "Another senior White House official said they believed that the situation had \"stabilized\" when asked about the White House's view of Bondi's performance.",
      "The administration's refusal to disclose the full contents of the government's investigation into Epstein, who killed himself in jail while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking minors in 2019, has caused a deep rift between Trump and significant elements of his MAGA base.",
      "Bondi is not in danger of losing her job because she is loyal and well-liked by the president and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, these sources, as well as a person who is close to the White House said, but Trump is no longer interested in taking heat for her.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump said it is up to Bondi whether to release \"credible\" information from Epstein-related materials, and three days later, he ordered his attorney general to seek a court's permission to release \"pertinent\" grand jury testimony from the Epstein probe. Bondi filed the required motion in court on Friday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Thursday that this week's firing of Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on the Epstein case, was handled by the Justice Department rather than Trump.",
      "It all appears to add up to Trump trying to redirect the Epstein storm toward Bondi.",
      "\u201cI do think that he likes and respects Pam, but she has without question caused some headaches for them,\u201d one person familiar with White House discussions said. \u201cAt the end of the day, at this point she is almost assuredly is just doing what she is told, so I believe she is very safe, but has had missteps.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Leavitt did not mention the Epstein affair in praising Bondi's record.",
      "\u201cAttorney General Pam Bondi is working tirelessly to end the weaponization that has rotted our justice system, remove violent criminals from our streets, and help President Trump in making America safe again,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThe president is appreciative of her efforts.\u201d",
      "Many of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters, spurred on by Bondi and other prominent figures in Trump\u2019s orbit, have long believed that the federal government hid damaging information about connections between Epstein and some of the nation\u2019s wealthiest and most powerful people.",
      "In February, Bondi told Fox News that an Epstein client list was \u201csitting on my desk right now\u201d waiting to be reviewed and released. Her department hyped up \"Epstein binders\" and circulated them to MAGA influencers. But the binders contained information that was already in the public sphere rather than highly sensitive and damning material.",
      "And in a memo quietly circulated at the end of the July Fourth weekend, Bondi's department concluded that the government has no evidence of the main components of Epstein-related conspiracy theories: a client list, a scheme to blackmail prominent figures or foul play in his death. Confirming what mainstream media outlets had previously reported, the unsigned Justice Department memo touched off a full-on political melee within the president's political base.",
      "The release of that memo \u2014 and the lack of Justice Department follow-up in the aftermath \u2014 created an information vacuum, which was then left largely to the president to fill, one White House official explained.",
      "Trump friend Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist, has spent much of the last two weeks torching Bondi on social media, referring to her as \"Blondi.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ve been exposing Pam Blondi since BinderGate,\" Loomer wrote on X last week. \"Some White House staff literally called me begging me to stop attacking her back in February and March. But, I\u2019m not getting any calls to stop this week. Speaks volumes, doesn\u2019t it?\"",
      "With Trump voters demanding more information from the president and the attorney general, several of Trump's most loyal allies \u2014 including Tucker Carlson and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk \u2014 distanced themselves from him on the issue. He responded by flaying them on Truth Social, calling his critics within the party \"weaklings\" and claiming that he no longer wants \"their support.\"",
      "Trump and White House officials have struggled to move past the Epstein imbroglio since the July Fourth weekend, perhaps having initially underestimated its staying power within the MAGA movement.",
      "Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is close to Trump, said the president does not have to try to quell the internal dissent all at once.",
      "\"Trump will methodically find ways to satisfy his base that he\u2019s serious and they\u2019ll get this thing done,\" Gingrich said. \"This is not a crisis; this is a problem.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., pressed Justice Department leadership about their handling of files related to the federal investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein, including reports that FBI personnel were instructed to \"flag\" any records that mentioned President Donald Trump.",
      "In a series of oversight letters written to Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Durbin questioned Bondi about \"contradictions\" in her public statements on the case, Patel about reports that he was \"pressured\" by Bondi to place 1,000 personnel on 24-hour shifts to mine roughly 100,000 Epstein-related records and Bongino about reported disputes among Trump officials about \u201cthe lack of transparency\u201d in their handling of the high-profile case.",
      "In the letters sent Friday, Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked each of the Trump administration officials to respond to information received by his office that suggested FBI personnel were specifically instructed to \"flag\" any records mentioning Trump.",
      "\"My office was told that these personnel were instructed to 'flag' any records in which President Trump was mentioned. ... Why were personnel told to flag records in which President Trump was mentioned,\" Durbin asked Bondi, Patel and Bongino in separate letters. \"What happened to the records mentioning President Trump once they were flagged?\"",
      "A Durbin aide told NBC News that the senator's office received that information from a protected FBI whistleblower disclosure.",
      "The FBI declined NBC News' request for comment on Durbin's letters.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "The letters mark the latest attempt by Democrats to keep attention on Epstein more than a week after the Justice Department released a memo outlining a decision to cease additional disclosures related to the investigation. The memo roiled Trump's MAGA base, creating a rare rift among Trump and the far-right base that thrusted him into power \u2014 a rift that Democratic lawmakers have aimed to widen.",
      "In the aftermath of the Justice Department memo, Bondi has faced blowback in part because of previous public statements she made pointing to the existence of thousands of pages of additional documents related to Epstein, including a purported \"client list.\"",
      "Durbin, like many of Trump's supporters over the past week, asked the attorney general to reconcile her earlier public declarations with her department's finding that \"no further disclosures\" are warranted in the case and that a review of records \"revealed no incriminating client list.\"",
      "\"Why did you publicly claim on February 21 that the client list was 'sitting on my desk right now to review?'\" Durbin asked Bondi. \"If it was not a client list, what was 'sitting on your desk' at that moment?\"",
      "Bongino and Patel have also faced backlash online. Both of them previously promoted conspiracy theories that suggested the Epstein case was part of a government cover-up to protect powerful political players involved in a child abuse ring.",
      "Patel, in the only post he's made to his personal social media account since the Justice Department memo was released, said \"the conspiracy theories just aren't true\" and \"never have been.\" Durbin, aiming to call attention to Patel's past suggestions of a cover-up, asked the FBI director to detail the conspiracy theories he was referring to in his post.",
      "\"What are the conspiracy theories you are referring to in your July 12 tweet that 'were never true?' If there are more than one, please explain each in detail,\" the senator wrote to Patel.",
      "NBC News previously reported that Bongino was \"out of control furious,\" skipped a day of work and considered resigning from his post due to the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein files, a topic Durbin questioned the former political commentator about.",
      "\"What was the nature of the dispute between you and White House and DOJ officials after the release of the July 7 memorandum,\" Durbin asked Bongino. \"Is this dispute between you and White House and DOJ officials the reason behind your July 11 absence from work?\"",
      "Durbin also questioned the Trump officials about reporting from The Wall Street Journal that alleged Trump wrote a letter to Epstein in 2003, accompanied by a drawing of a naked woman, that was included in a leather-bound birthday album gifted to Epstein for his 50th birthday, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.",
      "Trump has denied that he wrote the letter and he filed a lawsuit against the newspaper for publishing the story. NBC News has not independently confirmed the Journal's reporting.",
      "A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the newspaper\u2019s publisher, said in a statement, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\u201d",
      "\"Did personnel review any correspondence between President Trump and Mr. Epstein, including a letter in the reported 'leather-bound album' as part of this year's review [of Epstein records]?\" Durbin asked.",
      "Hours after the Journal's reporting, Trump on Thursday directed Bondi to \"produce any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony\" related to Epstein, \"subject to Court approval.\" Bondi on Friday filed a motion requesting the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein case.",
      "\u201cGiven the public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation into Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information,\u201d the document said."

      "When it comes to President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d few places could be impacted more significantly than Nevada \u2014 one of the country\u2019s most closely divided swing states.",
      "For starters, Nevada is expecting the law\u2019s changes to Medicaid and food assistance to boot hundreds of thousands of residents from crucial social safety net programs.",
      "Like other states in similar predicaments, lawmakers will have to scramble to figure out how to find money in the state budget to keep many of those people covered. But the impacts of the law on that budget and the state\u2019s broader finances could be even more significant than in many others because Nevada has no state income tax, and therefore is extremely limited in how it can find new revenues.",
      "Then there are the new law\u2019s tax provisions related to tipped employees and gamblers that will have an outsize effect on a state whose economy relies almost exclusively on casinos and hospitality.",
      "The implementation of the new law in the coming months and years will occur as Nevada is set to play a key role in the next midterm and presidential elections.",
      "In 2026, Gov. Joe Lombardo \u2014 who has walked a fine line between offering praise for certain aspects of the megabill while pushing back against others \u2014 is seen as the most vulnerable Republican governor up for re-election. And Nevada\u2019s battleground 3rd District, represented by Democratic Rep. Susie Lee, will be a key race in the fight for the House majority.",
      "And in 2028, Nevada will likely again host critical contests for the White House and Senate.",
      "Democrats are already eager to go on offense against the law. State Rep. Steve Yeager, the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly, said he\u2019s already been contacted by many constituents who have expressed \u201cconcern about what this bill might mean for them\u201d and how they could be impacted by its changes to Medicaid, food assistance, energy credits, taxes on tips and gambling.",
      "Yeager added he was going \u201cto make sure that every single voter who goes to the ballot box here next year in 2026 knows about this bill and knows about the impact.\u201d",
      "'A low-revenue state'",
      "Approximately 1 in 3 Nevadans are on Medicaid, according to data from the state and KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, due in part to a massive expansion of the program back in 2013 by then-Gov. Brian Sandoval, one of the first Republican governors to embark on Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Trump\u2019s law will institute steep cuts to Medicaid and food aid benefits mostly by establishing new work requirements, restrict state-levied fees on health care providers that are mostly used to fund Medicaid, and preclude the federal government from being responsible for reimbursing states any longer. In Nevada, as many as 100,000 people could fall off Medicaid as a result, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "But unlike some other states, which may be able to shift funds around in their budgets to build financial support for affected residents, Nevada\u2019s hands are largely tied. It has no state income tax and has a state constitutional provision requiring a two-thirds majority to raise revenue.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the funds to be able to fill these critical gaps,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cWe\u2019re a low-revenue state. \u2026 We\u2019re in a really tough place.\u201d",
      "Nevada is also likely to be uniquely impacted by a pair of tax provisions.",
      "Starting in 2026, gamblers will have to pay more taxes under the GOP\u2019s new law. That\u2019s because the law will limit what gamblers can deduct from their yearly taxes to 90% of their losses. Bettors can currently deduct the entirety of their losses \u2014 up until their winnings.",
      "Bettors have expressed concerns that the provision could cause professional gambling in the U.S. to fold. And Nevada Democrats say it\u2019s all but certain to impact the bustling and crucial industry in the casino-laden state.",
      "\u201cThis means if someone wins a big jackpot in Las Vegas and then loses that one jackpot later on, they would still be liable for 10% in taxes on gaming \u2018income,\u2019 even though they had not brought home anything,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said last week on the chamber floor. \u201cThat\u2019s not just bad math, it\u2019s bad policy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have boasted of the law\u2019s provision that they call \u201cno tax on tips.\u201d Trump unveiled the concept during a 2024 campaign event in Nevada, which is among the states with the highest concentration of service workers who rely on tips.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, one of my caddies \u2026 your tips will be 100% yours,\u201d Trump said of the policy idea during a January visit to Las Vegas shortly after he was sworn in for his second term.",
      "The law allows for a deduction on federal taxes of up to $25,000 in tipped income. At first glance, it appears it could be a boon for workers who rely heavily on tips.",
      "But economists at the Yale Budget Lab have written that 37% of all tipped workers don\u2019t earn enough money to even pay federal income tax, meaning that these people wouldn\u2019t gain from the new deduction.",
      "In addition, critics note the cap is relatively small and that it phases out once workers enter a higher income bracket ($150,000 per year). Plus, the provision only runs through 2028.",
      "Democrats also note that the law froze nearly all of the clean energy funds the state had received under President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. Nevada, where scorching temperatures have led to soaring energy costs for voters and businesses, was among the states that claimed the most IRA funds used to incentivize clean energy investments and jobs, as well as home energy rebates.",
      "As those funds dry up, so too could financial relief for residents and businesses.",
      "\u201cWith the undoing of some of the Inflation Reduction Act, losing monies that were in the bill, we\u2019re going to lose solar jobs \u2014 and I am confident that our power bills are going to increase,\u201d Yeager said.",
      "A key gubernatorial race",
      "Those impacts will loom particularly large in next year\u2019s governor\u2019s race in Nevada. Even before Trump enacted the law, Lombardo, who won his 2022 election over Democrat Steve Sisolak by just 1.5 percentage points, was the only Republican governor up for re-election next year whose race was rated by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d",
      "Nevada Democrats have already aggressively sought to link Lombardo to the \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cLombardo will have to reckon with the damage done to Nevadans\u2019 lives and livelihoods because he was too cowardly to stand up to Trump,\u201d said Nevada Democratic Party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno.",
      "Lombardo, for his part, has praised some of the tax provisions in the law, but he also warned Congress not to make changes to Medicaid funding ahead of its passage.",
      "\u201cWhile my administration continues to assess this bill as it moves to get signed into law, Nevadans should be excited about the potential impacts of tax cuts, investments in small businesses and American manufacturing, and efforts to help secure our border,\u201d Lombardo wrote on X the day before Trump signed it into law.",
      "A spokesperson for Lombardo declined to comment for this story but referred to that post on X, in which Lombardo also lauded the law\u2019s \u201cno tax on tips\u201d provision. The spokesperson also referred to the letters Lombardo wrote to Congress and state legislators expressing his concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on Medicaid, plus a letter he wrote to Trump urging him to reconsider the gambling losses provision.",
      "Lombardo was also among just seven Republican governors who did not sign a May letter in support of Trump\u2019s proposed \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "That tension underscores the bind many Republican incumbents are likely to find themselves in during next year\u2019s midterms as they seek to take credit for some of the tax-saving mechanisms of the bill while distancing themselves from the cuts that Democrats are already hammering them on \u2014 all while trying to avoid running afoul of Trump.",
      "Responding to questions about the political impacts of the law, John Burke, a spokesperson for the Lombardo-supporting Better Nevada state PAC, said in an email, \u201cUnder Governor Lombardo\u2019s leadership, Nevada is finally getting back on track, and the people of our state are seeing results.\u201d He pointed specifically to accomplishments on affordable housing and education.",
      "\u201cThe Governor has been vocal about his support for eliminating taxes on tips and supports a return to previous law on gambling losses,\u201d Burke added.",
      "State Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is so far the only Democrat who\u2019s entered the race against Lombardo, slammed the law for its impacts on health care and food assistance. He said \u201cservers and bartenders and hospitality workers are going to be getting played\u201d by Republicans\u2019 \u201cno tax on tips\u201d claims."

    "story": [
      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2014 During the first week of Bad Bunny\u2019s historic residency, fans sported outfits inspired by Puerto Rican folkloric culture, including straw hats known as \u201cla pava\u201d and traditional \u201cj\u00edbaro\u201d attire, reflective of rural Puerto Ricans who worked on farms until the 19th century.",
      "The fashion choice is a statement. It\u2019s consistent with the theme of his 30-show concert series: \u201cNo me quiero ir de aqu\u00ed,\u201d which translates to \u201cI do not want to leave here.\u201d",
      "The concerts bring to life the songs on Bad Bunny\u2019s sixth studio album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d or \u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos,\u201d which the artist has dubbed as his \u201cmost Puerto Rican\u201d album yet.",

      "\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re home,\u201d Ivy Torres told NBC News. She and her spouse, Alexis, are among the more than 600,000 people who are expected to visit Puerto Rico this summer to see the show \u2014 which is the first formal residency any singer has ever done at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos\u00e9 Miguel Agrelot, the biggest indoor entertainment arena on the island, seating over 18,000 people.",

      "Bad Bunny sings about this sentiment in his song \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d). The song addresses fears around the erosion of Puerto Rican identity amid an influx of wealthy people from the mainland who have moved there following the passage of tax breaks, as well as a recent rise in short-term rentals that limit affordable housing opportunities for local residents.",
      "Born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, Bad Bunny reached global success singing in Spanish, popularizing Puerto Rican slang across the world and putting a spotlight on the plight of Puerto Rican people.",

      "The album and residency effectively take fans on an emotional journey that fuses contemporary genres like reggaeton and dembow with traditional rhythms such as bomba y plena and 1970s salsa music.",
      "Inside a restaurant in Old San Juan, Puerto Rican artist and painter Joabel Ortiz has been showing an art exhibit dedicated to Bad Bunny and his latest album.",
      "Ortiz mixes traditional symbols of Puerto Rican culture like \u201cla pava\u201d with images of the superstar \u2014 highlighting the through line that connects a present-day cultural phenomenon like Bad Bunny to the roots of Puerto Rico.",
      "Puerto Rican officials estimate Bad Bunny\u2019s residency will have an economic impact of more than $186 million, generating more than 3,600 jobs and resulting in more than 35,000 hotel night bookings.",
      "But to his fans, it\u2019s Bad Bunny\u2019s focus on the people and the essence of what it is to be Puerto Rican that resonates the most.",
      "\u201cWe got a new influence to the world,\u201d Ortiz told NBC News. \u201cThat new influence is about our culture, about the ideas we got in the island, and how we do everything, how we speak, how we love, how we remember who we are.\u201d",

      "The annual alpha Capricornids, the Southern delta Aquariids and the Perseid meteor showers are all currently active, with each celestial show set to last through mid-August.",
      "Here's what to know about these meteor showers, and where and how you can spot shooting stars.",
      "The alpha Capricornids",
      "The alpha Capricornids and the Southern delta Aquariids will peak in activity at the end of this month, overnight from July 29 to 30, while the Perseids \u2014 often considered the best and most reliable shooting star display \u2014 will ramp up to its peak next month.",
      "Skywatchers will likely encounter mostly favorable conditions for catching meteor showers this July, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The alpha Capricornids meteor shower is not typically a strong display, but it can produce a number of bright fireballs while active. At its height, the meteor shower can produce around five shooting stars per hour under dark skies and clear conditions, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "The shower gets its name because the meteors appear to stream from the constellation of Capricorn. During this year\u2019s peak, the moon will be only 27% full, offering people on either side of the equator a chance to catch the celestial show.",
      "The alpha Capricornids meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through clouds of dust particles and debris from the comet 169P/NEAT, which completes one orbit around the sun every 4.2 years. As pieces of debris hit the planet\u2019s atmosphere and vaporize, they create bright streaks of light that sometimes leave behind bright trails.",
      "The Southern delta Aquariids",
      "The Southern delta Aquariids, as their name suggests, are best viewed from the Southern Hemisphere. This meteor shower is capable of producing up to 25 meteors per hour under ideal conditions, but the shooting stars are typically fainter.",
      "Southern delta Aquariids can be tricky to spot, according to NASA, but the best chances this year will likely be in the early morning hours.",
      "The meteor shower is thought to be caused by pieces of the comet 96P/Machholz, which completes one orbit around the sun every 5.2 years.",
      "The Perseids",
      "Finally, the Perseids meteor shower is underway and is expected to peak overnight from Aug. 12 to 13. The Perseids are usually one of the most highly anticipated skywatching events of the year because the meteor shower occurs during warm summer months in the Northern Hemisphere and it typically delivers a high rate of shooting stars. Under ideal conditions, the Perseids can produce as many as 100 shooting stars per hour.",
      "This year, however, the moon will be around 84% full, which will likely wash out meteors and \u201cseverely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity,\u201d according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "\u201cSuch conditions will reduce activity by at least 75% as only the brighter meteors will be visible,\u201d the society said in its forecast.",
      "The Perseids shower occurs when Earth passes through a cloud of dust particles and debris left over from a comet known as 109P/Swift-Tuttle."

He posted a photo of the blanket on a Facebook group where people across central Texas are keeping track of things they\u2019ve recovered from the devastation: waterlogged clothes, stuffed animals, Barbie dolls, marriage licenses, family photo albums. Rafferty eventually connected with the quilt\u2019s owner and hand-delivered it to her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a father of 3-year-old twin boys. I know if I\u2019d gone through something like these quilts, I\u2019d want it back,\u201d said Rafferty, 34.",
      "Rafferty is part of a loose network of first responders, volunteers and good Samaritans who have fanned out across the region to help reunite Texans with the cherished belongings, family heirlooms and everyday household knickknacks that were swept away when floods ripped through Kerr County over Fourth of July weekend, killing more than 130 people and leaving at least 100 missing.",
      "This week, NBC News spoke with people in the region about the objects that have turned up in the floods\u2019 aftermath \u2014 and why they matter. In some cases, seemingly trivial items have taken on far greater emotional significance in the wake of the deadly floods. These are some of their stories.",

      "Patty Hyatt was inside her mobile home with her 8-year-old grandson and her new beagle puppy early July 4 when her son called. The floodwaters were rising fast and they needed to get to higher ground as soon as possible, he told her. Hyatt, a 67-year-old retired teacher, loaded everyone into her Toyota Tacoma and headed to her son\u2019s house, leaving most of her things behind.",
      "When she returned to the Old River Road RV Resort the following morning, her 42-foot Forest River home was gone, washed away by the floods. She was heartbroken. \u201cI just lost stuff, not loved ones,\u201d she said \u2014 but most objects in her home were associated with special \u201cmemories\u201d and she was sorry to see them go."

      "LAPD Sgt. Travis Ward said the driver was shot after the collision, transported to the hospital and taken into surgery. For this reason, he said, the LAPD was unable to determine whether the driver was intoxicated.",
      "The LAPD described the person who shot the driver as \"a Hispanic male, approximately 5 feet, 9 inches tall, 180 pounds, bald, wearing a blue jersey, and possibly armed with a silver revolver.\" The man fled the scene on foot and was last seen going westbound from Vermont Avenue, the LAPD said.",

      "In another video, a group of bystanders could be seen removing an individual who appeared to be the driver from the vehicle before they assaulted him.

    "summary": "Dustin Poirier, a UFC legend, will fight for the final time on Saturday to 'be there for my family for the long run.'",
    "story": [
      "Make no mistake about it: Dustin Poirier is still at the top of his game. Even at 36, he remains among the UFC\u2019s most dangerous fighters both standing and on the mat. He has wins over Conor McGregor, Michael Chandler and Beno\u00eet Saint Denis in recent years.",
      "So why, despite a No. 6 ranking among lightweights and a headlining fight at UFC 318 against Max Holloway in New Orleans on Saturday, does he plan on taking off the gloves for good?",
      "It all comes down to family.",
      "\u201cMe and my wife have been together for a long time, since before I was fighting, so she\u2019s been on this whole journey with me,\u201d Poirier told NBC News last week. \u201cShe\u2019s been asking me to stop fighting for a long time, and so has my daughter.\u201d",
      "After 30 wins in 40 fights, a resume mostly made up of all-out wars that have made him a fan favorite, Poirier has followed their advice. The Lafayette, Louisiana, native will walk out in front of his hometown crowd and compete for the final time, ending a legendary career.",
      "Poirier said his long-term health was a major factor.",
      "\u201cI want to be there for my family for the long run,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to watch my daughter get married and always be there for her, not just physically, but mentally, too. I want to leave with my faculties. This isn\u2019t good for you. Getting kicked and kneed and punched in the head for 18 years isn\u2019t good for you.\u201d",
      "Poirier said he officially came to terms with the decision after his last fight against Islam Makhachev in June 2024. In that bout, a fifth-round submission loss, he suffered his third defeat in a championship. He previously fell to Charles Oliveira and Khabib Nurmagomedov, respectively, with the belt on the line. The UFC will typically only give you so many shots at a title.",
      "He likely would have needed another winning streak to get back into contention, he said, and at his age, with wear and tear on his body since he began fighting at 17, it didn\u2019t appear set to happen anytime soon.",
      "Facing Holloway on Saturday for the UFC\u2019s \u201cBMF\u201d belt \u2014 a title distinguishing the promotion\u2019s \u201cBaddest Motherf----r\u201d \u2014 is a nice consolation prize for years of thrilling fights. He could walk out to the octagon in front of his hometown crowd, beat another fan favorite and leave with gold around his waist.",
      "It would be the perfect ending to one of the UFC\u2019s most storied careers.",
      "Poirier emphasized how important it was to get out of the sport before the sport got him out. Too many fighters over the years have entered the cage past their prime with declining skills and athleticism and suffered life-altering damage.",
      "He said he still feels good enough to compete at a high level, which is why it was a tough choice to leave now.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not getting forced out of this,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m choosing to walk away, and that\u2019s very important to me.\u201d",
      "Unlike most fighters, Poirier has been outspoken about preventing neurological issues. He told NBC News ahead of the Makhachev fight that he was debating retirement, partially \u201cto take care of my brain health.\u201d",
      "One year later, it\u2019s still top of mind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something I thought about when I was a young kid in my early 20s or mid-20s,\u201d he said this week. \u201cIt\u2019s something that as I got older in the sport, I started realizing things and noticing things and doing my research and just growing up and realizing this isn\u2019t good for you. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t [become a fighter]. I\u2019m just saying take care of yourself.\u201d",

      "His opponent on Saturday has also been outspoken on the topic. Before his UFC 308 title fight against Ilia Topuria in October 2024, Holloway talked about the importance of brain health.",
      "\u201cYou only get one brain. Once that thing starts deteriorating, it\u2019s not like anything else where you can grow it back,\u201d he said. \u201cBe smart, go see specialists, go see doctors, go do research on your own brain health and take care of yourself.

The UFC has contributed more than $2 million to the cause.",
      "\u201cIf you had a way to identify people who are at risk of these long-term effects, then the hope is you could treat them early or advise people,\u201d Dr. Charles Bernick, the founder and primary investigator of the study, told NBC News. \u201cKind of empower athletes when they\u2019re active on their own brain health, so they can make decisions. That to me is the most exciting stuff.\u201d",
      "The Professional Athletes Brain Health Study remains an ongoing project, Bernick said. It aims to work with both current and retired fighters for a minimum of five years.",
      "\u201cThis gives us a real opportunity because some of the athletes that started as active athletes subsequently retired during the duration of the study,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re able to kind of get a perspective of what happens once a person stops fighting, stops getting exposed to whatever they\u2019re exposed to ... and try to understand why some people have ongoing problems, even though they\u2019re not exposed anymore, and [why] other people seem to be resilient.\u201d",

      "Like football players, fighters know the risks of a physically demanding sport. Nobody understands that better than Poirier.",
      "\u201cEvery fight, every fight camp takes something I can never get back. Pieces of me I can never get back,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna leave a piece of myself out there next weekend. That\u2019s just something that I\u2019ve come to terms with. But fighting is just something I do. I\u2019m a father and a husband and a business owner and a brother and a son. I\u2019m a lot of other things. Fighting is just something I do.\u201d"

      "When it comes to President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\u201d few places could be impacted more significantly than Nevada \u2014 one of the country\u2019s most closely divided swing states.",
      "For starters, Nevada is expecting the law\u2019s changes to Medicaid and food assistance to boot hundreds of thousands of residents from crucial social safety net programs.",
      "Like other states in similar predicaments, lawmakers will have to scramble to figure out how to find money in the state budget to keep many of those people covered. But the impacts of the law on that budget and the state\u2019s broader finances could be even more significant than in many others because Nevada has no state income tax, and therefore is extremely limited in how it can find new revenues.",
      "Then there are the new law\u2019s tax provisions related to tipped employees and gamblers that will have an outsize effect on a state whose economy relies almost exclusively on casinos and hospitality.",
      "The implementation of the new law in the coming months and years will occur as Nevada is set to play a key role in the next midterm and presidential elections.",
      "In 2026, Gov. Joe Lombardo \u2014 who has walked a fine line between offering praise for certain aspects of the megabill while pushing back against others \u2014 is seen as the most vulnerable Republican governor up for re-election. And Nevada\u2019s battleground 3rd District, represented by Democratic Rep. Susie Lee, will be a key race in the fight for the House majority.",
      "And in 2028, Nevada will likely again host critical contests for the White House and Senate.",
      "Democrats are already eager to go on offense against the law. State Rep. Steve Yeager, the Democratic speaker of the state Assembly, said he\u2019s already been contacted by many constituents who have expressed \u201cconcern about what this bill might mean for them\u201d and how they could be impacted by its changes to Medicaid, food assistance, energy credits, taxes on tips and gambling.",
      "Yeager added he was going \u201cto make sure that every single voter who goes to the ballot box here next year in 2026 knows about this bill and knows about the impact.\u201d",
      "'A low-revenue state'",
      "Approximately 1 in 3 Nevadans are on Medicaid, according to data from the state and KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, due in part to a massive expansion of the program back in 2013 by then-Gov. Brian Sandoval, one of the first Republican governors to embark on Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Trump\u2019s law will institute steep cuts to Medicaid and food aid benefits mostly by establishing new work requirements, restrict state-levied fees on health care providers that are mostly used to fund Medicaid, and preclude the federal government from being responsible for reimbursing states any longer. In Nevada, as many as 100,000 people could fall off Medicaid as a result, according to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "But unlike some other states, which may be able to shift funds around in their budgets to build financial support for affected residents, Nevada\u2019s hands are largely tied. It has no state income tax and has a state constitutional provision requiring a two-thirds majority to raise revenue.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the funds to be able to fill these critical gaps,\u201d Yeager said. \u201cWe\u2019re a low-revenue state. \u2026 We\u2019re in a really tough place.\u201d",
      "Nevada is also likely to be uniquely impacted by a pair of tax provisions.",
      "Starting in 2026, gamblers will have to pay more taxes under the GOP\u2019s new law. That\u2019s because the law will limit what gamblers can deduct from their yearly taxes to 90% of their losses. Bettors can currently deduct the entirety of their losses \u2014 up until their winnings.",
      "Bettors have expressed concerns that the provision could cause professional gambling in the U.S. to fold. And Nevada Democrats say it\u2019s all but certain to impact the bustling and crucial industry in the casino-laden state.",
      "\u201cThis means if someone wins a big jackpot in Las Vegas and then loses that one jackpot later on, they would still be liable for 10% in taxes on gaming \u2018income,\u2019 even though they had not brought home anything,\u201d Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said last week on the chamber floor. \u201cThat\u2019s not just bad math, it\u2019s bad policy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have boasted of the law\u2019s provision that they call \u201cno tax on tips.\u201d Trump unveiled the concept during a 2024 campaign event in Nevada, which is among the states with the highest concentration of service workers who rely on tips.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a restaurant worker, a server, a valet, a bellhop, a bartender, one of my caddies \u2026 your tips will be 100% yours,\u201d Trump said of the policy idea during a January visit to Las Vegas shortly after he was sworn in for his second term.",
      "The law allows for a deduction on federal taxes of up to $25,000 in tipped income. At first glance, it appears it could be a boon for workers who rely heavily on tips.",
      "But economists at the Yale Budget Lab have written that 37% of all tipped workers don\u2019t earn enough money to even pay federal income tax, meaning that these people wouldn\u2019t gain from the new deduction.",
      "In addition, critics note the cap is relatively small and that it phases out once workers enter a higher income bracket ($150,000 per year). Plus, the provision only runs through 2028.",
      "Democrats also note that the law froze nearly all of the clean energy funds the state had received under President Joe Biden\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. Nevada, where scorching temperatures have led to soaring energy costs for voters and businesses, was among the states that claimed the most IRA funds used to incentivize clean energy investments and jobs, as well as home energy rebates.",
      "As those funds dry up, so too could financial relief for residents and businesses.",
      "\u201cWith the undoing of some of the Inflation Reduction Act, losing monies that were in the bill, we\u2019re going to lose solar jobs \u2014 and I am confident that our power bills are going to increase,\u201d Yeager said.",
      "A key gubernatorial race",
      "Those impacts will loom particularly large in next year\u2019s governor\u2019s race in Nevada. Even before Trump enacted the law, Lombardo, who won his 2022 election over Democrat Steve Sisolak by just 1.5 percentage points, was the only Republican governor up for re-election next year whose race was rated by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report as a \u201ctoss-up.\u201d",
      "Nevada Democrats have already aggressively sought to link Lombardo to the \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "\u201cLombardo will have to reckon with the damage done to Nevadans\u2019 lives and livelihoods because he was too cowardly to stand up to Trump,\u201d said Nevada Democratic Party Chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno.",
      "Lombardo, for his part, has praised some of the tax provisions in the law, but he also warned Congress not to make changes to Medicaid funding ahead of its passage.",
      "\u201cWhile my administration continues to assess this bill as it moves to get signed into law, Nevadans should be excited about the potential impacts of tax cuts, investments in small businesses and American manufacturing, and efforts to help secure our border,\u201d Lombardo wrote on X the day before Trump signed it into law.",
      "A spokesperson for Lombardo declined to comment for this story but referred to that post on X, in which Lombardo also lauded the law\u2019s \u201cno tax on tips\u201d provision. The spokesperson also referred to the letters Lombardo wrote to Congress and state legislators expressing his concerns about the bill\u2019s impact on Medicaid, plus a letter he wrote to Trump urging him to reconsider the gambling losses provision.",
      "Lombardo was also among just seven Republican governors who did not sign a May letter in support of Trump\u2019s proposed \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "That tension underscores the bind many Republican incumbents are likely to find themselves in during next year\u2019s midterms as they seek to take credit for some of the tax-saving mechanisms of the bill while distancing themselves from the cuts that Democrats are already hammering them on \u2014 all while trying to avoid running afoul of Trump.",
      "Responding to questions about the political impacts of the law, John Burke, a spokesperson for the Lombardo-supporting Better Nevada state PAC, said in an email, \u201cUnder Governor Lombardo\u2019s leadership, Nevada is finally getting back on track, and the people of our state are seeing results.\u201d He pointed specifically to accomplishments on affordable housing and education.",
      "\u201cThe Governor has been vocal about his support for eliminating taxes on tips and supports a return to previous law on gambling losses,\u201d Burke added.",
      "State Attorney General Aaron Ford, who is so far the only Democrat who\u2019s entered the race against Lombardo, slammed the law for its impacts on health care and food assistance. He said \u201cservers and bartenders and hospitality workers are going to be getting played\u201d by Republicans\u2019 \u201cno tax on tips\u201d claims."

      "The main factor in deciding the best alternatives to plastic food containers is finding a material that doesn\u2019t leach and is safe to put in the microwave and dishwasher. Here\u2019s everything our experts recommend I keep in mind when making this list:",
      "Alternative materials: The best and most common non-toxic alternative to traditional plastic is glass, according to Woodruff. Unlike plastic, glass food containers aren\u2019t susceptible to leaching microplastics, making them safer to heat up, eat out of and prepare food in. Most of the food containers on this list are made of borosilicate glass, which is highly resistant to heat, thermal shock and cracking (though not shatterproof). Additionally, I also curated options that have ceramic coatings, which makes them stain resistant and nonstick, as well as containers made from stainless steel. While every container on this list is made from either glass or stainless steel, some of the included lids are made of BPA-free plastic and/or come with a silicone lining to prevent leaking, so some of the sets aren\u2019t entirely plastic free.",

      "How to shop for plastic food container alternatives",
      "Many plastic food container sets have chemical additives (many of which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose) with adverse health effects. This includes BPA, phthalates and PFAS \u2014 and those are only the handful of ones researchers know about, according to Woodruff. The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom. This includes leaking drains, dirty mops, compost and pet litter.  This could also include bits of food sitting in your garbage disposal.",
      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Anytime our hair fibers are pressed against a surface, there\u2019s a chance of the fibers becoming stressed via pulling or tangling from our head movements, says Hill. In addition to breakage caused by rough fibers from your pillow or sleep accessories, Malhotra says sleeping with wet hair can also cause damage, since wet hair is weaker and more prone to breakage. Along with breakage, you\u2019ll wake up to a tangled mess that may require more heat and styling to fix, she says. To avoid this, she recommends fully drying your hair at night and sleeping on a smooth, high-quality pillowcase \u2014 preferably silk or satin, like the options I listed above.",
      "Yes; although Hill cautions that all hair textures risk unwanted friction and tension, factors like your hair\u2019s porosity, your cleansing routine, scalp hydration and more can impact what areas of concern you should focus on. Here\u2019s some general advice Malhotra has for different hair types:",
      "Straight hair concerns typically center on greasiness and oiliness, along with losing volume, she says. Fine, straight hair is also more prone to tangling, knotting and matting. To combat this, she suggests avoiding heavy overnight hair products, like oils or creams, since they can encourage oil production and greasiness. \u201cUsing a silk pillowcase to reduce friction can help with overall hair health and stopping breakage,\u201d she says. Putting your hair in loose braids can also help you to avoid morning knots and keep your hair voluminous overnight.Wavy, curly and natural hair types all run the risk of getting frizzy overnight, for which Malhotra suggests using a light leave-in conditioner. \u201c[It] can keep hair hydrated while you sleep and help keep the shape of the waves, [which reduces] frizz,\u2019 she says.",

      "Once again, the best hairstyle for sleeping will depend on your hair type and current style. However, here are a few tips Malhotra and Hill suggest keeping in mind:",
      "For wavy and long hair, Malhotra suggests using a satin scrunchie or hair accessory to pull the hair into a high ponytail, a loose high bun, or a loose braid (this will help avoid unwanted creases and tangling, and make it easier to style the next morning).Fine or short hair tends to do well when kept down at night, since it reduces pulling/tension on the scalp, while thick, textured hair would benefit from sleeping in two braids to minimize tangles, says Hill.If you\u2019re putting your hair up, avoid any styles that may pull your hair too tightly, since it\u2019ll lead to increased breakage. For tightly coiled or curly hair, Hill recommends gathering the hair to the crowd of your head with a silk scarf (also known as \u201cpineappling\u201d).",

      "When Joel met his first wife-to-be, Elizabeth Weber, her last name was Small \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a coincidence that she shared the same last name as his then-best friend and bandmate Jon Small.",
      "In 1970, the married Smalls invited Joel to live with them and their son, out of both musical convenience and financial need. But the arrangement crumbled once an affair between Joel and Elizabeth Small began. Soon after it was discovered, Elizabeth Small went back to the name Weber, breaking off things with both her ex-husband and Joel.",
      "For a while.",

She was a very bright woman, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to show how smart she was. I suppose that made her kind of exotic. Intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind, but could also be seductive. Almost like a European type \u2014 not a typical American girl.\u201d",
      "Joel and Weber eventually rekindled their relationship (just as Joel and Small eventually renewed their friendship). And in 1973, Weber became both Joel\u2019s wife and his manager.",
      "The hit maker told Schruers that Weber became his muse, inspiring much of his music around the time of his 1977 album \u201cThe Stranger.\u201d",

      "The \u201cYou May Be Right\u201d singer met chef, food critic and cookbook author Katie Lee in 2002, and the pair quickly struck up a friendship. Lee, at the time, had to brush up on Joel's work to really find out about her pal.",

      "The equestrian and former finance executive, who\u2019s 33 years Joel\u2019s junior, gave the music icon a ride home following their happenstance introduction at a restaurant. That led to a piano performance for one and maybe something more.",
      "\u201cI may have got a little fresh,\u201d Joel later confessed to The New Yorker.",
      "Months after that, they officially started dating and soon, they moved in together. But unlike some of his earlier relationships, there was no rush to the altar.",

      "\u201cSome of them, I die laughing,\u201d Siwa tells TODAY.com in a Zoom interview. \u201cThen there\u2019s some that I\u2019m like, \u2018Where do people get the audacity? Why do people feel OK to sleep at night?' There\u2019s a fine line of comedy and fine line of trashing.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI turn around at him and said, \u2018Nice singing,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cHe ran off. I was just like \u2014 I wish I would\u2019ve pulled him aside and said, \u2018Look. If you\u2019re going to make fun of me, the least you could do is have a conversation with me.\u2019 I probably would have taken him to go buy a Gucci bag.\u201d",
      "Love it or hate it, \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d has become a cultural moment \u2014 which is ironic, considering Siwa didn\u2019t want to sing it in the first place. The idea came from a producer on her music team.",
      "\u201cShe played \u2018Bette Davis Eyes\u2019 and said, \u2018I bet you don\u2019t even know this song, but your voice would be incredible on it,'\u201d Siwa recalls.

      "The conversation was tabled until she was planning her set at the Tecate Emblema music festival in Mexico City and had 20 minutes left to fill. Siwa\u2019s mom brought up \u201cBette Davis Eyes.\u201d Still unsure, Siwa says she \u201cactually started crying\u201d over the idea of singing it onstage.",

      "This advice inspired the viral moment where Siwa changed the lyrics of \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d to \u201cChris Hughes's eyes\u201d onstage.",
      "Those following Siwa\u2019s personal life would know exactly what that means. It\u2019s a reference to her boyfriend, former \u201cLove Island\u201d contestant Chris Hughes. The two met on \u201cBig Brother UK.\u201d Siwa entered the show in a relationship with Kath Ebbs, an Australian influencer who identifies as a \"gender queer lesbian.\" The night the show ended, Siwa and Ebbs split up. Weeks later, Siwa and Hughes made things official. (In fact, he interrupted Siwa's conversation with TODAY.com with his rendition of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d)",
      "After performing the song live for the first time, she was struck and surprised by the feedback. \u201cThe response to it was unreal,\u201d Siwa says. \u201cPeople had so much good to say about it \u2026 people actually want this.\u201d",
      "Siwa teased a recorded version on her TikTok twice then released the full cover on July 10 \u2014 and the reactions, some of them more negative, poured in.",

      "Other artists who covered the song, like Taylor Swift, didn\u2019t use rasp like Carnes. Siwa defends keeping the rasp in her cover. For one, Siwa says she has \u201cvery broken vocal chords\u201d that make it possible to \u201ckind of replicate\u201d Carnes\u2019 singing style.",

      "We're about to go postal! \"Clueless\" is officially 30 years old.",
      "The hit rom-com starring Alicia Silverstone as fashionista Cher Horowitz, Paul Rudd as Josh, Stacey Dash as Dionne and Brittany Murphy as Tai, came out three decades ago on July 19, 1995.",
      "In the 30 years since its release, the movie's cultural legacy has only grown stronger. Its slang has become part of the cultural lexicon and its characters are a popular choice for duo Halloween costumes. Many celebrities have dressed up as Cher and Dionne as well, such as Kim Kardashian and her daughter North West, Iggy Azalea and Sabrina Carpenter.",
      "But when Silverstone visited to TODAY in 1995, when she was about 19 years old, she had no idea about the impact \"Clueless\" and Cher would have.",
      "During her chat on TODAY, Silverstone said she disagreed with the movie's title. She never saw Cher as clueless, even though her character did say some head-scratching things.",
      "\"The title is the one thing that throws me off because I think that Cher is a very intelligent character and the whole film is so intelligent. That title is sort of a joke, because the characters are so defined and so well-rounded that they really aren't clueless,\" she said.",
      "In \"Clueless,\" an adaptation of Jane Austen's \"Emma,\" Cher tries to play matchmaker for the people around her. Or, if she sees someone in need of a social boost, she'll step in with a makeover.",
      "Cher spoke in a type of Valley Girl dialect that confounded some theatergoers. But in her world, her words made perfect sense. The only way to really catch on to what she's saying is to see the way she uses the term.",
      "Speaking to TODAY, Silverstone explained where some of Cher's words originated.",
      "Cher calls her stepbrother, Josh, a \"Baldwin\" after she realizes that he's kind of attractive.",
      "\"A Baldwin is the hottest guy there is,\" Silverstone explained on TODAY.",
      "As for why she refers to Tai\u2019s uncool skater friends as Barneys? \"Barney, that's actually originally from 'The Flintstones,'\" Silverstone said.",
      "Cher\u2019s nickname for her mom, Betty, is also from \u201cThe Flintstones,\u201d Silverstone said \u2014\u00a0but more positive and meant to express her natural beauty.",
      "Cher also uses a piece of slang that took off in the '90s: \"Going postal.\" Silverstone explained on TODAY that \u201cpostal\u201d means \u201ccrazy.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Postal\u2019 is a great word,\u201d she laughed. \"(It means) she goes absolutely out of her mind, crazy.\"",
      "On TODAY, Silverstone said she was \"nervous\" to start in \"Clueless,\" which was her first comedy.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018I\u2019m not funny. I can\u2019t do that,\u2019 but when I finally got into it and realized that Cher was not just superficial and shallow, she\u2019s a really lovable, compassionate, happy girl, it made it all seem perfect,\u201d Silverstone said."

    "story": [
      "The Huda Mustafa who entered the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d villa and the one who walked out just before the finale were two different people.",
      "What happened in between \u2014 a toxic relationship that played out on national TV, a challenge performance that broke the internet, and the hard-won realization that sometimes the strongest thing you can do is walk away \u2014 is a story of growth, controversy and the power of choosing yourself.",
      "From day one, the North Carolina native was impossible to ignore. Her bold energy and intense approach to connections made her one of the season\u2019s most talked-about contestants, generating equal parts admiration and criticism from viewers who couldn\u2019t look away. She threw herself into villa life with the kind of all-or-nothing intensity that reality TV thrives on, but that same intensity would soon become her biggest challenge.",
      "Her relationship with Jeremiah Brown started like a wildfire \u2014 passionate, consuming, and ultimately destructive. What began as one of the villa\u2019s strongest couples quickly devolved into something viewers and fellow Islanders alike recognized as toxic, marked by love-bombing, explosive fights and drama that extended far beyond their personal bubble. It was messy, it was painful and it was all happening under the unforgiving gaze of cameras and public opinion.",
      "Then came the Heart Rate Challenge, the moment that would spark conversations that extended far beyond the show. A fan-favorite challenge, the Heart Rate Challenge tasks Islanders with performing steamy dances to see who can raise heart rates the most, often triggering tension and jealousy.",
      "When Huda decided to do her \u201cbiggest one,\u201d as she puts it to TODAY.com, the performance sent shockwaves through the villa and ignited viral speculation across social media. It was bold, it was controversial, and it was quintessentially Huda \u2014 unapologetic and competitive to her core.",
      "But perhaps the most surprising chapter in her \u201cLove Island USA\u201d journey came at the very end. After a brief romance with Chris, Huda made a decision that stunned viewers: she chose to walk away on her own terms, right before the season finale. For many fans, it wasn\u2019t just an exit \u2014 it was a redemption arc, a moment where she finally listened to her own voice over the noise of expectations and pressure.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to fake something if I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s there,\u201d Huda tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview.",
      "Now, safely removed from the villa\u2019s pressure cooker environment, she\u2019s ready to unpack it all: the love, the criticism, the personal growth, and the power that comes with choosing to move on.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "How does it feel to be back in the real world?",
      "It\u2019s overwhelming, but in a good way. It really is. I\u2019m honestly so happy that I went through that experience, and I\u2019m so happy to come out of that with so much love, especially while being in there and thinking I\u2019m completely hated. Mind you, like there are people that don\u2019t like me. That\u2019s fine. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion. But just seeing all of the love, which is obviously what I\u2019m focusing on, it\u2019s like, wow \u2014 I\u2019m speechless. Like, it\u2019s overwhelming. I\u2019m trying to get up to date on everything.",
      "In the moment, it was a shock when America voted to pair Iris with Jeremiah when, at the time, you two were probably the strongest couple in the villa. How do you look back on that moment now and how do you look back on your connection overall with Jeremiah?",
      "I think that we were toxic. We were both very toxic. Was I perfect in that? No. Was he perfect in that? No. I can understand why they would have separated us. America\u2019s vote, it took me by surprise in the moment, because I wasn\u2019t seeing things from an outside perspective. But looking at it from a different perspective, I can understand why.",
      "He told me himself, like he was learning through us. Things that I told him to do, he was changing to do it for other women. And I think that people can relate to that. I think a lot of girls, you know, have been the girl that kind of prepared a man to be in a relationship.",
      "Have you spoken to Jeremiah at all since leaving the villa, or do you plan on reconnecting with him?",
      "Naur, no, no. Uh-uh, no no.",
      "I think a lot of women can relate to going through a bad relationship and coming out stronger on the other side, which we saw through your relationship with Jeremiah. What have you learned that you\u2019ll apply in future relationships?",
      "Communicating in more of a mature way. Not letting my emotions get the best of me. Figure out a way to compromise in ways instead of just focusing on getting my point across. Really hearing the other person out.",
      "I think I would hold a lot of things in out of fear. It's better to just say it. Even if it ends things, it\u2019s just better to talk about it. There\u2019s a lot of things \u2014 slowing down in relationships, not getting too physical too fast, really getting to know somebody. It was a good learning experience in all honesty.",
      "The Heart Rate Challenge sparked tension in the villa. Why do you think that specific challenge caused so much fighting?",
      "I went in with a competitive mindset. It's just a challenge. I don\u2019t have feelings towards these guys in that way, but I\u2019m doing it to win. It\u2019s out of my control whether or not I\u2019m raising their heart rate or not. Talk to your man about that, not me.",
      "Everyone had really high expectations for me. Every girl and every guy was like, \u201cHuda, do your big one. Huda, this is your time to shine.\u201d I\u2019m like, OK, cool. But I will do my big one. I did my biggest one. And I mean, everybody consented to everything beforehand. We made sure of that.",
      "The men were enjoying their time until they saw their girlies weren\u2019t enjoying that, and that\u2019s when it was too much.",
      "I\u2019ve had these conversations off camera with certain guys who had agreed with me that yeah, when they saw their girls\u2019 reaction they realized, OK, maybe that was too much. It\u2019s kind of like when your man goes to a bachelor party and the girl\u2019s like, \"I didn\u2019t like that.\" And they\u2019re like, \"Damn, OK, maybe I did f\u2014 up.\"",
      "There were a lot of factors that weren\u2019t even shown that played into my decision at that time. I think everyone was caught off guard, but I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t. We knew that that was coming.",
      "Like, he would tell me to shut up. When I\u2019m asking you to compliment me in a meaningful way multiple times, knowing that that\u2019s my love language, I get \u201cgyatt\u201d and \u201csheesh.\u201d So it\u2019s like, why am I settling? Why would I settle for something like that?",
      "He would make commentary on other women. He had a wandering eye, especially off-camera. He would walk past me and not even look at me, he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge me in conversations. And I peeped all of these things. I was catching them and I kept my mouth shut, but I was keeping them in the back of my mind because I wanted him to show me his true self without me having to guide him. That\u2019s the whole thing I played into my final decision and I stand on that.",
      "He wasn\u2019t all bad, but there are things that are really important to me that are non-negotiables. That\u2019s what made me make my decision.",

      "2025's \"I Know What You Did Last Summer,\" a new movie with the same name as the 1997 slasher film, is less of a reboot and more of a sequel.",
      "Similar to the original, the movie follows a group of teenagers \u2014 Ava (Chase Sui Wonders), Milo (Jonah Hauer-King), Danica (Madelyn Cline), Stevie (Sarah Pidgeon) and Teddy (Tyriq Withers) \u2014 who accidentally cause a major car accident that leads to a death. They flee the scene, get Teddy's dad (Billy Campbell), a wealthy real estate developer, to cover up their involvement, and vow to never speak of what happened again. All appears to go as planned until the next year when Danica receives a threatening note with a pointed message on it: \"I know what you did last summer.\"",

      "But in a final showdown between exes Ray and Julie, who reluctantly returned to Southport in the wake of the attacks, Ray reveals that he helped Stevie in part because everyone in Southport seemingly forgot about the trauma he and his friends faced all those years ago. Over the course of the film, the new group of friends have to uncover what happened to Ray and Julie through deep archival research and local legend, as the horrifying events had been effectively covered up for the sake of attracting tourists to the beach town.",

      "Then in a post-credits scene, Brandy reprises her role as Karla Wilson, who starred with Hewitt in the 1998 sequel, \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.\" In that film, Julie and Karla go on a trip to the Bahamas and barely survive another killer\u2019s attacks.",
      "In the post-credits scene, Karla watches the news of the Southport murders at home. As she hears how Ray attacked Julie and was behind a new string of killings in Southport, the camera pans to a view from outside Karla's house. Then, ominous, suspenseful music starts playing, hinting that Karla might also be in danger. But when Karla gets to the door, it's Julie James, her old college roommate.",
      "After reuniting, Julie shows Karla an old photo of themselves, with red X's over their faces \u2014 a not so subtle indication that they're on a killer's list. Julie asks Karla for her help, and she responds simply by asking who they have to take down next."

      "\u201cI mean, I was in there half a day \u2014 a half a day. I said my one line. \u2018OK, I got my day rate. I\u2019m going to eat dinner tomorrow.\u2019 And that was it. And the next thing I know, it\u2019s still living.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an absurd moment in a farcical film filled with absurd moments, which is fitting since it was written by David Zucker, his brother Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams, a trio known as ZAZ  who had previously hit pay dirt with the comedy classic \u201cAirplane!\u201d",
      "To someone who may not be familiar with the movie, the description of the Enrico Pallazzo line sounds ludicrous, but that quote has left quite an impression on moviegoers. It\u2019s hilarious, memorable and endlessly satisfying to say.",
      "Holton was thrilled to get the opportunity to work with ZAZ, whom he had admired for their work on \u201cPolice Squad!,\u201d the short-lived TV series that inspired the \u201cNaked Gun\u201d movie. He says his line dovetailed perfectly into the rest of the film.",
      "\u201cWhen I actually saw the scene and everything that was going on in the scene and how that fit into it, I went, \u2018OK, now I get it,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "The scene helped cement Holton\u2019s status as a 1980s film icon after he scored parts as Francis in \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure\u201d and Chubby in \u201cTeen Wolf.\u201d He says he didn\u2019t work with any of the movie\u2019s stars during his scene in \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d but got to meet Priscilla Presley at a convention about a year ago.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if she remembered me from the film or whatever, but we had a little talk and I got a pic with her,\u201d he says.",
      "Holton says he also met Nielsen before his death, calling him \u201cone of those guys I would love to have as a neighbor.\u201d",
      "Nielsen played Drebin in three \u201cNaked Gun\u201d movies, and now Liam Neeson steps in as the lead character in the upcoming \u201cNaked Gun\u201d reboot, opening Aug. 1. Holton hopes for the best for everyone affiliated with it, but doesn\u2019t intend to see it.",
      "\u201cI might watch part of it, but I don\u2019t have a burning desire to see what they\u2019ve done with it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s too much of that in Hollywood, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I wish them the best of luck.\u201d",
      "There are parallels between Nielsen \u2014 who was in \u201cAirplane!\u201d \u2014 and Neeson, with both of them enjoying long careers as dramatic actors before turning to comedy. Holton points to Neeson\u2019s previous body of work in films like \u201cExcalibur\u201d and \u201cTaken,\u201d noting that he\u2019s \u201ca good actor,\u201d which should serve him well as he takes the reins of a revived beloved franchise.",
      "\u201cIf he executes the role properly, he\u2019ll do well,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m certainly rooting for him,\u201d he adds."

      "The real von Trapp family fled Austria in 1938 \u2014 and not by crossing the Alps with their suitcases, as they do in the film. Instead, they took a train to Italy the day before the borders closed in Austria and ended up in the United States.",

    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, head of the fund\u2019s malign finance and corruption team. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

      "In the United States, Lois Lane kisses Superman for a steamy 33 seconds. For those watching the new Superman blockbuster in India, however, when the hero leans in to kiss his paramour, the movie jumps forward abruptly.",
      "That\u2019s because Indian censors have deemed the midair kiss as being \u201coverly sensual.\u201d They have also objected to other parts of the James Gunn blockbuster, shaving 8 seconds off here and there to achieve a 13+ rating, according to local reports and filmgoers.",
      "\u201cThere was an abrupt cut, and it just felt very out of place,\u201d said Kautuk Kundan, 27, who runs an artificial intelligence startup in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru and watched the film over the weekend. \u201cThere were two or three similar cuts in the movie wherein the movie is progressing, and suddenly there\u2019s an abrupt cut, and then it\u2019s the next scene.\u201d",
      "Intervention by authorities has Indian moviegoers fuming, who accuse the censors of making moralistic changes while adopting a double standard for Bollywood films, which are often laced with innuendos, misogyny and sensual scenes.",
      "Indian filmmakers and distributors have long had a strained relationship with India\u2019s censor authority, the Central Board of Film Certification. It\u2019s well expected that if a movie contains any explicit scenes, kisses or profanity, those scenes will be cut. Showing affection is limited to long hugs, with the justification given that India\u2019s population is still mostly conservative and religious, and the scenes could be uncomfortable.",
      "The new Superman film isn\u2019t alone in being hit by censors."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing turn against his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has inspired hopes in Ukraine and among its supporters that he is starting to believe what they\u2019ve been telling him all along: Moscow is the antagonist and the only way to stop it is with cash and military equipment.",
      "But while Monday\u2019s apparent U-turn was dramatic, other Ukraine supporters, former officials and other foreign policy experts are wary at least and deeply skeptical at worst.",
      "\u201cThe question that Europeans and Ukrainians are asking,\u201d according to Ivo Daalder, former United States ambassador to NATO, is \u201chow real is this change? And how lasting is this change? And what does it really mean in terms of American policy toward the region?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that the Trump administration has moved the goal posts,\u201d having briefly cut off aid to Ukraine in February, he said. \u201cSo there are a lot of questions here.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But on  Monday in the Oval Office, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, he said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the Kremlin and that the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "Alongside that, if Putin does not agree to a peace deal in 50 days, Trump said, he will slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods. That lag time has been criticized across Europe, with officials and experts asking why Trump is giving additional time to an autocrat who has hardly wavered in his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "The anxiety is fueled further by the widespread perception in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is a president who makes decisions on a whim and is prone to changing them.",
      "Trump himself hinted at this propensity to change his mind quickly. He recalled going home one night and telling first lady Melania Trump, \u201c\u2018I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.\u2019\u201d To which she responded, \u201c\u2018Oh, really, another city was just hit\u2019\u201d in Ukraine by Russia\u2019s missiles.",
      "The exact details of Trump\u2019s new direction are as yet unclear.",
      "He said that the shopping list included Patriot missiles, the state-of-the-art American defensive system that Ukraine says it desperately needs to fend off Russia\u2019s nearly nightly aerial assaults.",
      "European NATO allies were going to buy \u201cbillions of dollars worth of military equipment\u201d from the U.S. \u201cand that\u2019s going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine, he added.",
      "The Patriot missiles could arrive in Ukraine \u201cvery soon \u2014 within days, actually,\u201d expedited by European nations giving their existing weapons to Ukraine and replacing them with the new systems delivered by the U.S., he said.",
      "\u201cThis is really big,\u201d said Rutte, a man who often heaps praise on Trump. \u201cIt will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc.\u201d He added, \u201cif I\u2019m Ukraine, I think this is really great news.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has clashed several times with Trump and his team, posted on X thanking the president \u201cfor the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\u201d",
      "Other endorsements came with caveats.",
      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",
      "However she suggested that waiting almost two months to impose tariffs was too long: \u201cFifty days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians every day.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a view also held by Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey, that supports Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless significant pressure is applied on Putin and the Russian economy immediately, more innocent civilians will die.\u201d",
      "Russian officials mixed grave condemnation with mockery.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cvery serious\u201d because it was \u201caddressed personally to President Putin.\u201d Whereas former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called it a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d about which \u201cRussia didn\u2019t care.\u201d",
      "A senior Kremlin official told NBC News that Putin may not rush to respond. \u201cWe need to analyze the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might take some time.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, the optimism of Ukraine\u2019s supporters will be dictated by what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s weapons deal \u2014 and whether he sticks with his renewed direction of thinking on the conflict.",
      "\u201cWe need to be a bit cautious as to whether this is a sea change in Trump\u2019s opinion or if it\u2019s just another part of a whiplash effect as he veers backwards and forwards,\u201d Matthew Savill, , director of military sciences at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute think tank, told NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News. \u201cHis overriding goal is to get credit for ending the fighting.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (July 15, 2025, 2:25 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated where the nonprofit Hope for Ukraine is based. It is in Roseland, New Jersey, not Portland, Oregon."

    "story": [
      "An elite Chinese cyberspy group hacked at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year, the Department of Defense has found.",
      "The hackers, already responsible for one of the most expansive cyberespionage campaigns against the U.S. to date, are alleged to have burrowed even further than previously known and may have obtained sensitive military or law enforcement information. Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December. The memo did not say which state.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",
      "The Department of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A National Guard Bureau spokesperson confirmed the compromise but declined to share details.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",
      "\u201cCyberattacks are a common threat faced by all countries, China included,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. \u201chas been unable to produce conclusive and reliable evidence that the \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 is linked to the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

      "\u201cThere must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act,\u201d Huckabee said on X.",
      "Musallet had traveled from his home in Tampa, Florida, to visit his mom, brother and sister.",
      "Huckabee, an evangelical Christian who was governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007, maintained an arch-conservative position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict when he ran for president in 2016. He has long been a staunch advocate for settlers\u2019 rights to colonize Palestinian land.",

Power was cut for 80,000 families in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and other locations in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK said on the Telegram app.",
      "The attacks came hours after Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart not to target Moscow. It followed a report by the Financial Times citing two people familiar with the conversation that he had encouraged Zelenskyy to step up attacks deep inside Russia.",
      "NBC News has not independently confirmed the Financial Times\u2019 reporting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has previously lavished praise on Vladimir Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Monday gave the Russian president 50 days to agree to a peace deal. During a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House, he also said that he would slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods.",

      "\u201cRussia does not change its strategy,\u201d Zelenskyy said Wednesday in a post on Telegram, a day after a strike in his hometown in central Ukraine. \u201cIn order to effectively counteract this terror, we need a systematic strengthening of protection: more aircraft, more interceptors, more determination to make Russia feel our answer.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump may have expected a Russian shudder of fear after he threatened to impose \u201cvery severe tariffs\u201d if Moscow didn\u2019t agree a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, his comments appear to have prompted a collective public shrug.",
      "Calling Trump's statements \u201cvery serious,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russia needs \u201ctime to analyze\u201d them.",
      "But investors in the Russian capital who had been gearing up for tougher measures instead embraced a 50-day grace period on tariffs set by Trump on Monday and the Moscow Stock Exchange was up 2.7% after it opened Tuesday morning.",
      "Oil prices also fell by more than $1 after the announcement, hinting that investors don't think Trump will follow through on his threat to impose the tariffs.",
      "Trump \u201cdid not announce any immediate anti-Russian measures or the confiscation of illegally blocked Russian assets,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, a prominent nationalist politician, said on Telegram on  Tuesday, adding that the president was trying to balance Western support for Kyiv while avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin.",
      "Trump announced the levies along with the shipment of new weapons to Ukraine during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House on Monday.",
      "His comments came as a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made its way through Congress. If passed, it would seek to impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Praising Trump\u2019s announcement, Graham and his bill\u2019s co-sponsor,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that \u201cthe ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin\u2019s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.\u201d",

      "And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a hard-liner who frequently issues over-the-top threats, called Trump\u2019s threat a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don\u2019t have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\u201d Trump said, without providing further details.",
      "After the announcement, a White House official said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs was referring to Russian goods, as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports.",
      "The president\u2019s comments signal a marked shift in tone over his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. We\u2019ve always gotten along well,\u201d Trump said in March.",
      "Many Western countries have cut most of their own financial ties to Moscow since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, its smaller neighbor, triggering the first major land war in Europe since World War II.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about tariffs on countries like India and China that are buying their oil,\u201d Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told reporters Monday after Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cAnd it really is going to, I think, dramatically impact the Russian economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of secondary tariffs are \u201cnever going to go anywhere\u201d as long as he is unwilling to impose costs on Moscow directly, Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "The tariffs also risk upending delicate China-U.S. trade talks, according to Liu Baocheng at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics.",
      "The \u201cunilateral imposition of punitive trade measures ... risks creating new and unnecessary complications,\u201d Liu said, adding that the 100% secondary tariffs intended to pressure Moscow could instead \u201cseverely backfire by undermining global economic stability and fragmenting international cooperation.\u201d",
      "Most concerning, Liu added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariff agenda has also raised the stakes for India, which has been negotiating a trade deal with Washington to see tariffs on goods from India drop below 20%.",
      "Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told reporters Tuesday that his country had \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with Graham over its concerns and interests on energy and security.",

    "summary": "A study of more than 1 million people found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of autoimmune disease, allergies and autism.",
    "story": [
      "Aluminum in childhood vaccines is a target of vaccine skeptics, who blame the ingredient on myriad health concerns. But a study of more than 1 million people, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found no link between aluminum in vaccines and an increased risk of 50 chronic conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergies and autism.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread vaccine misinformation for years, said on a podcast in 2024 that aluminum in vaccines is \u201cextremely neurotoxic.\u201d (An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.)",
      "Senior study author Anders Hviid said that, as a parent, he understood the concerns about vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cOur study addresses many of these concerns and provides clear and robust evidence for the safety of childhood vaccines. This is evidence that parents need to make the best choices for the health of their children,\u201d said Hviid, who is a professor and the head of epidemiology research at Statens Serum Institut, a sector of the Danish Ministry of Health focused on combating and preventing infectious diseases.",
      "Hviid and his team used Denmark\u2019s nationwide registry to look for any connections between aluminum exposure from childhood vaccines and 50 chronic disorders, including 36 autoimmune disorders, nine allergy or asthma conditions, and five neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and ADHD.",
      "The study looked at more than 1.2 million people born in Denmark from 1997 through 2018 and followed them until the end of 2020. Because health records in Denmark are meticulously kept by government agencies, the researchers were also able to compare children who received more aluminum in their vaccines by age 2 compared those who received less. The study didn\u2019t include unvaccinated children.",
      "The researchers found no link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and any of the 50 conditions.",
      "Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, said Scandinavian public health studies are of uniquely good quality.",
      "\u201c[This excellence is] partly because they have, for a long time, had such a unified health system,\u201d said Kedl, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new study. \u201cEveryone is tracked for life from birth and you can go back for many years and ask, \u2018Can we find a link between something that happened in the past and in the future?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hviid said the catalyst for the Danish study was a widely criticized Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded study, published in 2022, that suggested a link between aluminum in childhood vaccines and increased asthma risk. The study, however, didn\u2019t distinguish between aluminum from vaccines and aluminum from other sources. It also contained inconsistencies: for example, in one group the researchers analyzed, more aluminum exposure wasn\u2019t linked to increased asthma risk, contrary to the study\u2019s conclusions.",
      "\u201cIf you are looking at people who got vaccines that contained aluminum versus those who had fewer, you have to control for confounding factors, you need to know that the only different source of aluminum these people received was from those vaccines,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "The CDC study was not able to do that, Offit said. Aluminum is the third-most abundant metal on Earth and people are exposed to the metal through breast milk, air and water, he said.",
      "\u201cAluminum is part of our daily diet and has been since the beginning of time. That is the point people don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Neither Osterholm nor Offit were involved with the new study.",
      "CDC officials said at the time that it appears that aluminum-containing vaccines \u201cdo not account for the overall trends that we see.\u201d",
      "Osterholm said the strength of the broader research is that it piles on dozens of studies that have drawn the same conclusion as the new study.",
      "\u201cOne study does not make for a safe vaccine supply or not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the accumulative data that comes from many studies that have been done, that together demonstrate the safety of vaccines.\u201d",
      "Why is aluminum in vaccines?",
      "Different ingredients are added to vaccines for different reasons. Aluminum \u2014 added to vaccines as aluminum salts \u2014 is what\u2019s known as an adjuvant. These additives act as a beacon for the immune system, pointing out invaders and prompting the body to produce antibodies against an antigen, or the virus or bacteria a vaccine aims to protect against.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just have an antigen and have an immune response, you need some kind of stimulus to trigger that response,\u201d said Kedl, of the University of Colorado. \u201cAn adjuvant is a substance that alerts the body\u2019s immune response to the vaccine\u2019s antigen. Without adjuvants, you actually create tolerance, which is the opposite effect of what you want a vaccine to do.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., aluminum salts are used in the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) as well as vaccines for pneumonia, HPV and hepatitis B.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum that is in vaccines is in the form of extremely small amounts of aluminum salts which is not the same as elemental aluminum which is a metal,\u201d Hviid said. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for parents to understand that we are not injecting metal into children.\u201d",
      "Aluminum salts from vaccines are injected into the muscle and most are cleared away by the body and filtered out through the kidneys within two weeks, though small amounts can linger for years.",
      "\u201cThe aluminum-containing vaccines form the backbone of our childhood immunization programs,\u201d Hviid said, adding that there are currently no viable replacements. \u201cIt is critically important that we keep politics and science apart in this issue. If not, it is the children, including U.S. children, who are going to suffer the consequences.\u201d"

      "Those statements come after Trump sent a letter to the E.U.

After initially backing down from his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs and promising trade deals with dozens of countries, Trump has steadily returned to his trade war posture, sending letters to countries around the world with ultimatums and tariff rates from 20% to 40%.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron of France, a key source of U.S. food and wine exports, said Saturday he strongly disapproved of the 30% tariff and urged the E.U. to speed up \u201cthe preparation of credible countermeasures.\u201d He said trading partners such as the U.S. and Europe \u201cowe each other\u201d respect.",

      "Ireland is the top source of U.S. pharma imports from the E.U., and serves as the European headquarters of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta.",
      "Speaking in Brussels on Monday after a meeting of E.U. trade ministers, the European Commission\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said the 30% tariff \u201cis absolutely unacceptable. That is the level which is absolutely prohibitive to any trade.\u201d",
      "Last year, the total value of E.U.-U.S. trade amounted to nearly $2 trillion.",
      "Some are still expressing hope for a deal.",
      "\u201cThe clear impression was that we were very, very close in agreement in principle,\u201d Denmark\u2019s foreign minister said Monday after the trade ministers meeting. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t possible due to this presidential letter, but it is still our major vision that we should reach an agreement, but we also want to send signal that it must be a fair deal for everybody.\u201d",
      "For its part, the E.U. has delayed any countermeasures \u2014 or retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. \u2014 but it currently has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a long road ahead, but a channel of communication is now open for the first time in years,\" a royal source told the newspaper about the meeting.",
