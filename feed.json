      "The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed.",
      "A judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.",
      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

      "NEW YORK -- Comic Amber Ruffin has a new spring gig.",
      "PEN America told The Associated Press on Monday that Ruffin will host the free expression organization's gala fundraiser on May 15. The comic had been scheduled as a featured speaker April 26 at the White House Correspondents Association' s annual dinner. But the WHCA rescinded the offer to Ruffin, a blunt critic of President Donald Trump, saying it wanted to focus on journalistic achievement.",
      "In a statement Monday, PEN co-interim CEO Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf praised Ruffin for her \u201cbrilliant social commentary, her satire and exceptional talent.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is truly emblematic of the talented creators who we need on stages and in writers\u2019 rooms during a time of unprecedented censorship in this country. We\u2019re both delighted and honored to have her with us,\" Shariyf added.",
      "PEN also announced Monday that Wesleyan University President Michael Roth will receive the PEN/Benenson Courage Award for \u201chis unwavering commitment to defending academic freedom, protecting protest rights, and resisting attempts to silence dissent in higher education.\u201d Roth has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration's threats to end research funding for Columbia University, Harvard University and other schools, with issues cited ranging from fighting antisemitism to whether transgender athletes can participate in sports.",
      "Ruffin, whose credits include writing for NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, last year's host for the PEN gala, has said she was cut from the WCHA event after telling organizers that she had no intentions of being evenhanded. During a Daily Beast podcast last month, Ruffin said she was told \u201cyou need to be equal and be sure that you give it to both sides and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.'\"",
      "Taylor Budowich, a deputy chief of staff at the White House, has called Ruffin a \u201csecond-rate comedian.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree. On Tuesday, it's his turn.",
      "The Harvard scholar learns a long-buried puzzle about his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, information which scrambles his ancestry and opens up a new branch that goes back to Ireland.",
      "\u201cI was moved to tears,\u201d Gates tells The Associated Press ahead of the airing. \u201cI used to pass her grave at the Gates' plot in Rose Hill Cemetery and I would say, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019m going to out you. I\u2019m going to tell the world your secret.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",
      "\u201cFor a guy with a PhD in English literature, I think I can do pretty well on the AP genetics exam,\u201d he says, before proving it with a thorough explanation of autosomal DNA.",
      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",
      "\u201cI believe that knowing about our ancestors is fundamental to knowing about ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to deal with the past is to know about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of people who would pretend that the past is irrelevant and we need to look forward, William Faulkner wrote, \u2018The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u2019\u201d Gates adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still with us, shaping both who we are and the society and our norms under which we function.\u201d",

      "The American Library Association has unveiled the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",
      "Most of the books listed have LGBTQ+ themes, continuing a yearslong trend. Other objections include references to drug addiction, such as in Ellen Hopkins' \u201cCrank,\u201d and to slavery and sexual abuse, including those in Patricia McCormick's \u201cSold.\u201d",
      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble. A lot of librarians are operating under these kinds of threats.\u201d",

      "Regional Mexican music is crossing borders and going global",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were cancelled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

      "North died Sunday at his home in Lake Butler, Florida, after battling colon cancer, said Laurie Jacobson, a longtime friend, and Bonnie Vent, who was his booking agent.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

They are part of a growing drama in the Asian entertainment world that raises questions about society\u2019s treatment of celebrities in crisis, with harsh media and online commentary amplifying their lowest moments.",
      "This week, South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun publicly denied allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was under the age of sexual consent. His emotional press conference followed Kim Sae-ron\u2019s suicide in February, which reignited allegations that they were romantically involved.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the case.",
      "Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea's most promising film stars. She began acting at age 9 in the 2009 film \u201cA Brand New Life,\u201d which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d (2010) and \u201cA Girl at My Door\u201d (2014), also invited to Cannes.",
      "Her career halted in May 2022 after she crashed her car in Seoul while driving under the influence. Despite offering a public apology and reportedly paying compensation to shops that lost power because of the crash, she faced relentless negative attention.",

      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Media and online commentators scrutinized her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health.",
      "She killed herself on Feb. 16, Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, also has been one of South Korea\u2019s most recognized actors, known for dramas such as \u201cMy Love from the Star\u201d (2013) and \u201cQueen of Tears\u201d (2024) as well as films like \u201cThe Thieves\u201d (2012) and \u201cSecretly, Greatly\u201d (2013).",
      "Speculation about a relationship with Kim Sae-ron began last year when she posted a photo of them together, quickly deleted. Gold Medalist, the agency co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun, denied the relationship, according to South Korean media.",
      "Days after Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death, a YouTube channel known for its politically charged content, HoverLab, alleged that she and Kim Soo-hyun had been in a six-year romantic relationship beginning in 2015, when she was 15 and he was in his late 20s. The channel released what it called evidence including photos, videos and letters. Kim Soo-hyun has called them fabricated.",
      "Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family had approached HoverLab to release the materials, calling it an attempt to restore Kim Sae-ron\u2019s image.",
      "On March 27, a lawyer representing Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family presented to journalists what the family claimed was a photo of an undelivered letter written in 2024 in which Kim Sae-ron described Kim Soo-hyun as her \u201cfirst and last love\u201d and referenced a five-to-six-year relationship.",
      "The letter was written after she failed to reach Kim Soo-hyun to discuss a debt she owed his agency, according to the lawyer. After Kim Sae-ron's contract ended and wasn't renewed, the agency asked her to pay back 700 million won (about $520,000) in damages related to her drunk-driving case. Her family says the demand placed severe pressure on her.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun has acknowledged that he dated Kim Sae-ron but insisted their relationship began after she became an adult. He called claims of an underage relationship false and damaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also not true that the deceased made a tragic choice because of my avoidance (of her), or because my agency pressured her about debt,\" an emotional Kim told Monday\u2019s press conference.",
      "He refused to answer a question from the AP about when he first met Kim Sae-ron.",
      "Whether any laws were broken depends largely on timing. South Korea raised its age of sexual consent from 13 to 16 in 2020. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, and the family alleges the relationship began in 2015, when she was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun maintains that their relationship lasted from summer 2019 to fall 2020, when Kim Sae-ron was a legal adult.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency has taken legal action against the family of Kim Sae-ron and HoverLab, which first aired the underage relationship claims, for distributing private photos and videos of the actor, including images of Kim Soo-hyun kissing the late actor. Kim\u2019s agency said Kim Sae-ron had visited his apartment and his family was present. The agency said they were not dating at the time.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun's lawyer announced a civil lawsuit seeking 12 billion won (approximately $8.15 million) in damages against the YouTube channel and Kim Sae-ron's family, along with criminal complaints alleging defamation and violation of privacy laws. Kim Soo-hyun and his agency also sued the YouTube channel operator for stalking.",
      "The family\u2019s legal representative and HoverLab both told the AP on Wednesday that they plan to sue Kim Soo-hyun and his agency for making false claims about his relationship with the late actor.",
      "Kim\u2019s death reignited criticism of South Korea\u2019s relentless tabloid and digital media culture. Her family has singled out videos with speculative, unverified content portraying her as emotionally unstable and morally questionable.",
      "Suing for defamation is often a lengthy, costly battle for South Korean celebrities, as many platforms, like YouTube, are based overseas. Punishments are typically light, with fines or suspended sentences.",
      "Other high-profile cases following negative online attention have included the deaths of K-pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019 and \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Fashion brand Prada has ended its collaboration with Kim Soo-hyun. South Korean cosmetics company Dinto terminated its one-year contract with him, citing the seriousness of the controversy. 7-Eleven Taiwan canceled a Kim Soo-hyun fan event last month, citing schedule changes.",
      "An online petition this week calling for the age of consent to be raised from 16 to 19 has gathered nearly 40,000 signatures on the National Assembly\u2019s website.",

      "The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance at a music festival in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn\u2019t mean that expression should be free of consequences,\u201d Landau wrote on X. \u201cThe last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \u201cface monetary and criminal sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know that outrage is not enough,\u201d Lemus said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible to ban (the music).\u201d",
      "Since, a number of the band's future shows have been cancelled, one town's government saying that the show \u201cdidn't have the municipal permissions needed\u201d to carry out the performance.",
      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\u201d",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly cancelled, ticket sales websites read: \u201cNo tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \u201cnarco corridos\u201d, expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer as to why he had to be put down other than it relates back to what happened,\u201d said Albert Whitehead, who cared not only for the 8-year-old reindeer named Star but also the decades-long tradition of having a reindeer in downtown Anchorage.",
      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen's gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star's pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",
      "Results won\u2019t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.",
      "There has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.",
      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "The Greek section of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Monday its staff had diagnosed the children, who are aged between 6 months and 6 years old, with moderate to severe acute malnutrition and in need of immediate medical intervention.",
      "\u201cChildren make up about 25% of the (camp\u2019s) population, yet pediatric care remains insufficient, not only within the center but on the entire island of Samos,\u201d MSF Greece\u2019s Director General Christina Psarra said in a news release.",
      "The six children, who hailed from Afghanistan and Syria, all arrived in the camp with their families within the last two to three months, and it was not possible to determine whether they had already been suffering from malnutrition before they arrived, Psarra told The Associated Press.",
      "However, \u201cdefinitely the conditions in the camp have made things more difficult and have had an aggravating effect,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked about the MSF claims, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum said it would have a response later Monday.",
      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",
      "Psarra noted that the children had already endured grueling journeys to arrive in Samos, and conditions inside the camp exacerbated their medical situation.",
      "Rights groups have reported dire conditions in the camp in Samos, including poor sanitation and a shortage of running water.",
      "\u201cThey are children who have been through painful journeys. They have had many difficulties in arriving,\u201d Psarra said of the malnourished children on Samos. \u201cThe conditions in the camp makes it even worse.\u201d",
      "Greece lies on one of the most popular routes into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Many make the short but treacherous boat journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands like Samos, often in small, unseaworthy inflatable dinghies.",
      "Last week, at least seven people, including three children, died near another Greek island, Lesbos, after the inflatable dinghy they were traveling in sank. Another 23 people survived and were taken to a migrant camp in Lesbos.",

      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",

      "\u201cOver the course of the year, that\u2019s up to 165 to 170 suicide attempts that were prevented at these participating health care systems,\u201d Ahmedani said.",
      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas' still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.",
      "Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to \u201ccontrol the outbreak\" and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.",
      "Seminole is the epicenter of the outbreak, which started in late January and continues to swell \u2014 with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "The second young child died Thursday from \"what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,\u201d and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday in a news release. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was \u201creceiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.\u201d",
      "This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.",
      "It's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he \u201cdeveloped bonds\u201d with the Mennonite community in West Texas in which the virus is mostly spreading.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation\u2019s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \u201cdelay care\u201d for a child who is sick with measles.",
      "\u201cCall your doctor and make sure you\u2019re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s social media post said CDC employees had been \u201credeployed.\u201d CDC spokesman Jason McDonald clarified late Sunday that the first CDC team arrived in early March and left Gaines County on April 1, while a team led by Patel \u201cwas redeployed and arrived today to assess needs\" as ordered by Kennedy and requested by Texas' governor.",
      "Asked about the outbreak Sunday by reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing reports on it,\u201d adding that if the outbreak \u201cprogresses, we\u2019ll will have to take action very strongly.\u201d",
      "Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.",
      "The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials in a post on X.",
      "\u201cEveryone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTop health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\u201d",
      "Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.",
      "A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People \u201cshould be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician's orders and that too much can be dangerous.",
      "Doctors at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they've treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cThis is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\u201d Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that\u2019s how you prevent people from dying of measles.\u201d",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn\u2019t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

      "A group of health workers has been making weekly visits to this and a dozen other places across Pretoria. In the project backed by the University of Pretoria and the Tshwane municipality, they offer the chance to exchange needles for new, sterile ones.",
      "Needle exchange is not a new idea globally, but such efforts have been jolted by the Trump administration\u2019s decision to kill 83% of U.S. Agency for International Development programs around the world.",
      "In South Africa, which has more people living with HIV than any other country, treatment for people with HIV has been hit hard. Users who share needles are especially at risk of such diseases.",
      "The team in Pretoria includes doctors and social workers who have built relationships with the drug users, encouraging them to accept an opioid-substitution therapy, and offering treatment if they have illnesses like HIV.",
      "The need for such help is increasing. Last year, a University of Pretoria report estimated that 84,000 people inject drugs in South Africa, and in Pretoria there was HIV prevalence of 38%. South Africa's overall HIV prevalence is over 12%, according to government data.",
      "The report said the country's drug market for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is worth about $3.5 billion, and growing.",
      "While the Community Oriented Substance Use Program in Pretoria is fully funded by the municipality and the university, it is indirectly affected by the shock to the global aid system. Some nonprofits that the program partners with have closed.",
      "And at least one local health clinic that was providing services in Pretoria has closed, forcing patients to turn to often crowded, poorly funded government-run facilities.",
      "Now, harm reduction programs like the Pretoria one for drug users will face stiff competition for sharply shrinking resources.",
      "As doctors did consultations, Phumulani Mahlangu expressed regret for his situation. The 30-year-old said he is addicted to a heroin mixture locally known as nyaope. He is homeless and has three children in his hometown nearly 200 kilometers (124 miles) away.",
      "\u201cIn 2013, I experienced with nyaope with friends. I never felt such relaxation before,\" he said as he prepared a syringe. \u201cI started spending my own money on it and that's how I got here.\u201d He takes part in the needle exchange.",
      "Dipolelo Lekota is one of the few female drug users at the site. The 30-year-old said she was struggling to quit drugs so she could take care of her child, who is with relatives.",
      "She said she can access HIV medication and clean needles through the visiting project to avoid infecting others.",

      "The roughly two dozen workers who ran the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program were among 10,000 people fired as part of a dramatic restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

      "On Thursday, 13 U.S. senators, including two Republicans, sent a letter to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urging the administration to reverse its decision to cut the LIHEAP staff.

      "Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov, from Scottsdale, Arizona, was arrested on March 31, two days after he set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island \u2014 part of India\u2019s Andaman and Nicobar Islands \u2014 in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe, police said.",
      "A local court last week sent Polyakov to a 14-day judicial custody and he is set to appear again in the court on April 17. The charges carry a possible sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine. Indian authorities said they had informed the U.S. Embassy about the case.",
      "Visitors are banned from traveling within 3 miles (5 kilometres) of the island, whose population has been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.",
      "In 2018, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinel islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.",
      "Indian officials have limited contacts to rare \u201cgift-giving\u201d encounters, with small teams of officials and scientists leaving coconuts and bananas for the islanders. Indian ships also monitor the waters around the island, trying to ensure outsiders do not go near the Sentinelese, who have repeatedly made clear they want to be left alone.",
      "Police said Polyakov was guided by GPS navigation during his journey and surveyed the island with binoculars before landing. He stayed on the beach for about an hour, blowing whistle to attract the attention but got no response from the islanders.",
      "He later left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as an offering, made a video on his camera, and collected some sand samples before returning to his boat.",
      "On his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, the capital of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, an archipelago nearly 750 miles (1,207 kilometres) east of India\u2019s mainland. A case was registered against him for violation of Indian laws that prohibit any outsider to interact with the islanders.",
      "Police said Polyakov had conducted detailed research on sea conditions, tides and accessibility to the island before starting his journey.",
      "\u201cHe planned meticulously over several days to visit the island and make a contact with the Sentinel tribe,\u201d Senior Police Officer Hargobinder Singh Dhaliwal said.",
      "In a statement, police said Polyakov's \"actions posed a serious threat to the safety and well-being of the Sentinelese people, whose contact with outsiders is strictly prohibited by the law to protect their indigenous way of life.\"",
      "An initial investigation revealed Polyakov had made two previous attempts, in October last year and January, to visit the islands, including in an inflatable kayak.",
      "Police said Polyakov was drawn to the island due to his passion for adventure and extreme challenges, and was fascinated by the mystique of the Sentinelese people.",
      "Survival International, a group that protects the rights of Indigenous peoples, said Polyakov\u2019s attempted contact with the tribes of North Sentinel was \u201creckless and idiotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis person\u2019s actions not only endangered his own life, they put the lives of the entire Sentinelese tribe at risk,\u201d the group\u2019s director Caroline Pearce said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "The role of dogs in Italian alpine rescues is becoming more important as the number of people caught by avalanches increases \u2014 up by 50% over the last 25 years",
      "CORTINA D'AMPEZZO, Italy -- Zen, a 5-year-old border collie, circled friskily around a mound of snow as he picked up a scent, his quick movements signaling to his handler that someone was buried deep below.",
      "Zen has been a rescue dog for three years, and on this day, he was setting an example for 20 others dogs being certified for avalanche rescue in the heart of the Italian Dolomites, where the breathtaking jagged peaks have long enchanted writers, painters and outdoor enthusiasts alike.",
      "The role of dogs in Italian alpine rescues is becoming more important as the number of people caught by avalanches increases \u2014 up by 50% over the past 25 years.",
      "Climate change has made heavy, wet snow more common in midelevations between 1,500-2,500 meters (5,000-8,000 feet) where most excursionists venture, which makes avalanche survival less likely by compressing air pockets that would allow a trapped alpine or off-piste skier to breathe.",
      "A trained avalanche rescue dog's nose can locate someone buried deep in the snow more accurately than any transponder, making their role fundamental in reaching victims \"in the shortest possible time,'' said Adriano Favre, who ran the canine training camp in the mountains above Cortina D'Ampezzo, a chic ski resort and a venue of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games.",
      "After picking up the scent, Zen energetically emerged with a sign of life \u2014 a rope tug toy \u2014 from the snow den masquerading, for the purposes of the training exercise, as an avalanche. Shortly after, his handler digs a volunteer victim out of the snow, and showers Zen with praise and affection.",
      "\u201cAll of our dogs need to have an intense relationship with the handler. If not, we can\u2019t read what he is trying to tell us,\u2019\u2019 said Zen\u2019s handler, Paolo Sbisa, who has raised him from puppyhood. \u201cOnce the relationship is built, they will do anything to make us happy.\u2019\u2019",
      "Nine days earlier, on a nearby pass just 3 miles (2 kilometers) away as the crow flies, Zen\u2019s mission was deadly serious.",
      "Three backcountry skiers were buried by an avalanche on Giau Pass at 2,300 meters \u2014 normally a route for beginners amid scenic rugged rockfaces near a mountain road that turned deadly the day after a heavy snowfall.",
      "Zen and his handler were on the first helicopter leaving base 10 minutes away. By the time they arrived, witnesses had pulled a 51-year-old man from the snow. Rescuers located the second victim with a transponder, a 38-year-old man buried 2 meters (6 feet) deep.",
      "Zen\u2019s nose was key to locating the third skier, a 40-year-old woman buried in 3 to 4 meters (9 to 12 feet) of snow \u2014 deeper than the usual, according to Sbisa, making the role of a rescue dog critical in determining where to dig.",
      "Despite their efforts, both she and the second victim died \u2014 revealing a disheartening truth: If you need a dog to find you, it\u2019s probably too late. For this reason, Sbisa and other rescuers say it is critical for backcountry excursionists to have and know how to use transponders, foldable probes and shovels, as the best chance of survival is self-rescue by companions or witnesses. Dogs, more often than not, locate bodies.",
      "\u201cIf something goes wrong though, the only weapon Alpine rescuers have to search is dogs,\" Sbisa said. \"We have no other chance.\u2033",
      "Avalanches involving people who need rescue in Italy have doubled since the turn of the century from a rolling average of 30 a year to 60, according to the AINEVA snow and avalanche monitoring service. During the same period, the number of excursionists struck on average also increased significantly, from 65 a year to 110 a year, based on rolling averages.",
      "For those who are buried, survival comes down to time. The best chance comes when a person freed in the first 10 to 15 minutes, said Igor Chiambretti, the technical chief of Italy\u2019s AINEVA snow and avalanche association. If not found within 35 minutes, studies show 70% of victims die of asphyxiation.",
      "Rescue dogs in Italy are always on the first helicopter leaving base. But it typically takes 15 to 20 minutes to arrive at any avalanche scene. Bad weather prolongs that window.",
      "Putting a pair of avalanche dogs at ski areas instead would reduce that arrival time to five minutes, something Chiambretti said is being considered in Italy, where 80 avalanche dogs are active.",
      "Adding to the risk are snow dumps \u2014 heavy wet snow with the water content between 3% and 8%. They were once considered spring snow, but now come as early as December, thanks to more moisture in the air and warmer temperatures, Chiambretti said.",
      "They are especially common in the heavily trafficked middle altitudes and reduce the chances of survival by compressing air pockets. With more of this kind of snow, the number of people to survive a complete burial will be fewer and fewer, Chiambretti said.",
      "Snow dumps have grown especially more common in Italy, on the southern edge of the Alps, facing the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "\u201cThe Mediterranean basin is considered a so-called hot spot, that is an area of the planet where climate change, particularly warming, is more than the global average,\u2019\u2019 said Gianni Marigo, an AINEVA climatologist. The Italian Alps, in turn, \u201care a hot spot within a hot spot.\"",
      "The big picture of climate change also means less overall snow for avalanches as glaciers globally shrink, especially in the Alps. Snow depth levels in the southwestern Alps has decreased nearly 5% a decade since the 1980s, according to a 2024 study.",
      "\u201cWith a wetter and warmer snow climate, consequences of burial will be more severe,'' while blunt trauma will become more likely as snow cover becomes thinner, according a 2021 study published in Frontiers in Physiology. \"Asphyxia and trauma, as causes of avalanche death, may increase.\"",
      "By the time a rescue dog located Roberto Ferrino buried beneath an avalanche in the Alps of northwestern Piedmonte, the lone backcountry skier had been buried for 4 hours and 40 minutes \u2014 well beyond the average survival time.",
      "To this day, seven years after his accident, neither Ferrino nor his wife know how he made it \u2014 except that an air pocket formed around him that allowed him to breath. His body temperature dropped to 26 degrees Celsius (78.8 Fahrenheit) and heart rate to 30 beats per minute.",
      "Still, Ferrino doesn't regret braving the mountains alone that day despite warnings of a \u201cconsiderable\u201d avalanche risk. He says his error was in choosing a steep slope and not paying attention to the winds.",
      "\"If I had done the normal route, nothing would have happened,'' he said.",

      "Naruhito, in his 65th birthday remarks in February noting the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, stressed the importance of remembering the wartime history and telling younger generations about the tragedy. Japan fought in the war and invaded large areas of Asia in the name of his grandfather, then-Emperor Hirohito.",
      "The island, whose official name today is Iwo-to, was the site where Japanese and American soldiers faced off in one of the war\u2019s fiercest battles.",
      "The battle of Iwo Jima lasted from Feb. 19 to March 26, 1945, as the United States tried to take control of a key strategic point to advance to mainland Japan.

All 1,100 residents of Iwo Jima except for 103 men drafted as military employees were forcibly evacuated to mainland Japan. Former residents and their descendants have been allowed to visit the island for memorial events but not to live.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A military alliance between Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger withdrew their respective ambassadors from Algeria in response to the downing of a Malian drone last week, the group said late Sunday.",
      "The Alliance of Sahel States, which goes by its French acronym AES, blamed Algeria on social media for the drone's downing and condemned it as an \u201cirresponsible act\u201d that violated international law.",
      "The act was \"contrary to historical relations and fraternal relations between the peoples of the AES Confederation and the Algerian people,\u201d the group said.",
      "Malian Prime Minister Gen. Abdoulaye Maiga, in a statement on the Malian Foreign Ministry's social media, denied claims by the Algerian government that the drone had violated Algeria's airspace by over 2 kilometers (1.2 miles). He claimed that \u201cthis action proves, if proof were needed, that the Algerian regime sponsors international terrorism.\u201d",
      "Mali in the statement also summoned the Algerian ambassador, withdrew from a 15-year-old regional military group that includes fellow AES member Niger, and will file a complaint with \u201cinternational bodies\u201d about the incident.",
      "The development comes as tensions are on the rise between Algeria and its southern neighbors, including Mali.",
      "After coming into power, the juntas in the three AES countries left the Economic Community of West African States, the nearly 50-year-old regional bloc known as ECOWAS, and created their own security partnership, the Alliance of Sahel States, in September last year.",
      "Some analysts described it as an attempt to legitimize their military governments amid coup-related sanctions and strained relations with neighbors.",
      "Rida Lyammouri, a Sahel expert at the Morocco-based Policy Center for the New South, said the latest war of words was unlikely to escalate beyond that. He doubted the Malian government's ability to conduct a thorough investigation because the crash \"took place in an area it doesn\u2019t control, and what remains of the drone has been recovered by groups opposed to the government.\u201d",
      "\"That being said things are unlikely to escalate beyond the communication war. Mali, and other AES members would not engage militarily against Algeria, and vice versa. This will most likely only further existing diplomatic tensions at the moment,\u201d continued Lyammouri.",
      "Algeria once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali\u2019s government and Tuareg rebels. But the two countries have grown apart since a military junta staged coups in 2020 and 2021, putting military personnel in charge of Mali's key institutions.",
      "Algeria has denounced the direction that Mali\u2019s new government has taken and its expanded efforts to quash rebellion in historically volatile parts of northern Mali. Afraid of the conflict spilling over the border, Algerian officials have denounced Mali\u2019s use of Russian mercenaries and armed drones near Tin Zaouatine, a border town in the north were the drone was found.",
      "The Malian government did not recover the drone and videos seen on social media, posted by northern rebels, show them in possession of the remains of a Turkish made Akinci drone manufactured by Baykar downed in Tin Zaouatine.

      "The arrest of Istanbul\u2019s opposition Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on corruption charges has ignited large-scale anti-government protests. Imamoglu had emerged as the main challenger to Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule since he was elected mayor of Istanbul in 2019, overturning a quarter-century of rule by parties from Turkey\u2019s conservative Islamist tradition.",

      "While in prison, Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP\u2019s presidential candidate for the election scheduled for 2028, but which will likely to take place earlier.",

      "VIENNA -- Germany marked the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazis' Buchenwald concentration camp on Sunday as one of the country's former presidents warned against \u201cradicalization and a worldwide shift to the right.\u201d",
      "The governor of the state of Thuringia, Mario Voigt, and former German President Christian Wulff spoke at a ceremony in the city of Weimar, near Buchenwald, attended by scores of people, including several Holocaust survivors from across Europe.",
      "Voigt, whose state includes Buchenwald, called it \u201ca place of systematic dehumanization\u201d and said that everything that happened at the death camp \u201cwas designed to break the human spirit and its dignity.\u201d",
      "The Buchenwald concentration camp was established in 1937. More than 56,000 of the 280,000 inmates held at Buchenwald and its satellite camps were killed by the Nazis or died as a result of hunger, illness or medical experiments before the camp\u2019s liberation on April 11, 1945.",
      "Voigt also said that the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel showed that \u201cthe intention to exterminate Jews is not a thing of the past.\u201d",
      "He was referring to the attack by the Palestinian militant group that left some 1,200 people dead and 251 taken hostage, sparking the war between Israel and Hamas. The Israeli retaliatory offensive in the Gaza Strip has killed at least 50,695 Palestinians and wounded 115,338, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.",
      "In his speech, Wulff issued a stark warning about the current global political situation.",
      "\u201cDue to the brutalization and radicalization and a worldwide shift to the right, I can now \u2014 and this makes me uneasy \u2014 imagine more clearly how this could have happened back then,\u201d Wulff said, referring to Nazi terror and the developments leading up to it.",
      "He called for active commitment to democracy and the preservation of humanity. He said: \u201cWe bear a permanent, ongoing, eternal responsibility from this because evil must never be allowed to prevail again.\u201d",
      "Wulff also criticized the anti-immigrant and far-right Alternative for Germany party. He said that those who \u201ctrivialize\u201d the party \u201care ignoring the fact that the Alternative for Germany\u2019s ideology is creating a breeding ground for people to feel uncomfortable in Germany and that they are actually in real danger.\u201d",
      "Holocaust survivor Naftali F\u00fcrst, now 92, spoke at the wreath-laying ceremony held at the camp\u2019s former roll call area. He spent ages 9 to 12 in four different concentration camps, including Auschwitz.",
      "\u201cTo this day, the image is etched in my memory: carts pushed by prisoners loaded with corpses that were collected from the barracks and taken to the crematorium, reduced to ashes,\u201d F\u00fcrst recalled.",
      "Addressing the dwindling number of Holocaust survivors, F\u00fcrst remarked, \u201cThere are by now only very few of us left. Soon, we will pass the baton of remembrance on to you for good. In doing so, we are entrusting you with a historic responsibility. Remember on our behalf what you have learned from us. Because you are the witnesses of the witnesses.\u201d",
      "F\u00fcrst concluded: \u201cKeep coming back to this place, to Buchenwald, where civilization was reduced to zero. Remain vigilant in our name, and in memory of us, recognize when human rights, women\u2019s rights, children\u2019s rights, and minority rights are being violated. And when and where democracy is under threat, act and remain, each of you, a human being.\u201d",
      "In the run-up to the memorial event, Israeli officials objected to a planned commemoration speech by philosopher Omri Boehm, the grandson of a Holocaust survivor and a known critic of the Israeli government and its actions in Gaza. This prompted organizers to withdraw the invitation.",
      "Some 6 million European Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust.",

      "Thousands of supporters gathered at Place Vauban, near the golden dome of Les Invalides and the tomb of Napoleon, for what was billed as a protest \u2014 but observers said it had all the markings of a campaign rally.",
      "The National Rally, Le Pen's party, organized the event in response to what it calls a politically motivated verdict. But with chants of \u201cMarine Pr\u00e9sidente!\u201d and \u201cThey won\u2019t steal 2027 from us,\u201d the message was clear: this was more than a protest. It was a show of populist defiance aimed squarely at France\u2019s institutions.",
      "At the heart of that charge stood Jordan Bardella, Le Pen\u2019s 29-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and president of the National Rally. His speech was fiery, accusing France\u2019s judges of trying to silence the opposition.",
      "\u201cMarch 29 was a dark day for France,\u201d he said, referencing the date of Le Pen\u2019s conviction. \u201cThe people must be free to choose their leaders \u2014 without interference from political judges.\u201d",
      "Though he claimed the party would respect democracy, Bardella denounced magistrates\u2019 unions and warned of \u201ca system determined to crush dissent.\u201d Supporters carried signs reading \u201cJustice taking orders\u201d and \u201cStop the judicial dictatorship.\u201d Others wore \u201cJe suis Marine\u201d (\"I am Marine\") shirts or compared Le Pen to U.S. President Donald Trump, who was convicted of civil fraud: \u201cTrump can run \u2014 why not Marine?\u201d",

Her appeal is expected next year.",
      "The reaction has been sharply divided.

      "He also criticized the unusually rapid pace of Le Pen's appeal. \u201cHer appeal has been fast-tracked so it can be heard in the summer of 2026, well before the 2027 presidential election, and significantly faster than a typical criminal case,\u201d Goodman said.",

      "Though police were out in force, only minor clashes were reported.",
      "Beyond the legal battle, Sunday\u2019s gathering of the National Rally revealed a deeper strategy. Party leaders have spent the week accusing judges of plotting a \u201cjudicial coup.\u201d They\u2019ve called the sentence a political \u201cexecution.\u201d The goal is not just to overturn the ruling \u2014 it\u2019s to convince voters the legal system itself can\u2019t be trusted.",
      "It\u2019s a page from the Trump playbook: paint the courts as biased, the system as broken, and frame any legal setback as an attack on democracy. The ballot box becomes the only authority that matters.",
      "\u201cThe judges wear robes, but they\u2019re just politicians in disguise,\u201d said Claude Morel, 68, a pensioner from the southern city of Marseille. \u201cLet the people decide.\u201d",

      "Wall Street could soon be in the claws of another bear market",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street could soon be in the claws of another bear market as the Trump administration's tariff blitz fuels fears that the added taxes on imported goods from around the world will sink the global economy.",
      "The last bear market happened in 2022, but this decline feels more like the sudden, turbulent bear market of 2020, when the benchmark S&P 500 index tumbled 34% in a one-month period, the shortest bear market ever.",
      "Here are some common questions about bear markets:",
      "A bear market is a term used by Wall Street when an index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 20% or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time.",
      "Why use a bear to refer to a market slump? Bears hibernate, so they represent a stock market that\u2019s retreating. In contrast, Wall Street\u2019s nickname for a surging market is a bull market, because bulls charge.",
      "The S&P 500, Wall Street\u2019s main barometer of health, was down 1.2% in Monday afternoon trading. It's now 18.4% below the all-time high it set on Feb. 19.",
      "The Dow industrials fell 1.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which already was in a bear market, dropped 0.9%.",
      "The most recent bear market for the S&P 500 ran from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12 in 2022.",
      "The trade war has ratcheted up fear and uncertainty on Wall Street over how businesses and consumers will respond.",
      "President Donald Trump followed through on tariff threats last week by declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.",
      "Global markets cratered the next day, and the sell-off deepened after China announced it would retaliate with tariffs equal to the ones from the U.S.",
      "Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they\u2019re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also provoke trading partners into retaliating, which can hurt all economies involved.",
      "Import taxes can also cause economic damage by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories and what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.",
      "The tariffs come at a time when the U.S. economy is already showing signs of slowing. Markets are also worried that tariffs could fuel inflation, which recently ticked higher.",
      "On average, bear markets have taken 13 months to go from peak to trough and 27 months to get back to breakeven since World War II. The S&P 500 index has fallen an average of 33% during bear markets in that time. The biggest decline since 1945 occurred in the 2007-2009 bear market, when the S&P 500 fell 57%.",
      "History shows that the faster an index enters into a bear market, the shallower they tend to be. Historically, stocks have taken 251 days (8.3 months) to fall into a bear market. When the S&P 500 has fallen 20% at a faster clip, the index has averaged a loss of 28%.",
      "The longest bear market lasted 61 months and ended in March 1942. It cut the index by 60%.",
      "Generally, investors look for a 20% gain from a low point as well as sustained gains over at least a six-month period. It took less than three weeks for stocks to rise 20% from their low in March 2020.",
      "If you need the money now or want to lock in the losses, yes. Otherwise, many advisers suggest riding through the ups and downs while remembering the swings are the price of admission for the stronger returns that stocks have provided over the long term.",
      "While dumping stocks would stop the bleeding, it would also prevent any potential gains. Many of the best days for Wall Street have occurred either during a bear market or just after one ended. That includes two separate days in the middle of the 2007-2009 bear market when the S&P 500 surged roughly 11%, as well as leaps of better than 9% during and shortly after the monthlong 2020 bear market.",
      "Advisers suggest putting money into stocks only if it will not be needed for several years. The S&P 500 has come back from every one of its prior bear markets to eventually rise to another all-time high.",
      "The down decade for the stock market following the 2000 bursting of the dot-com bubble was a notoriously brutal stretch, but stocks have often been able to regain their highs within a few years.",

      "At the Festichoc chocolate festival in Geneva over the weekend, Trump administration tariffs announced last week did little to sour the mood on Switzerland\u2019s most famous sweets",
      "GENEVA -- With the normally brisk Easter season around the corner, the mood in Switzerland\u2019s chocolate business is bittersweet, thanks to high cacao prices and \u2014 now \u2014 the newly added U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "Many Swiss, from the government to chocolatiers to watchmakers and other businesses, are sensing \u201cshock\u201d over the tougher American position on trade, but many are also taking a wait-and-see stance.",
      "At the Festichoc chocolate festival in Geneva over the weekend, the Trump administration tariffs announced last week were on many minds, though they seemed to do little to sour the mood on Switzerland\u2019s most famous sweets.",
      "Julie Jammes, marketing manager for Canonica, a Geneva chocolatier with three stores in San Francisco, said her company hasn't yet made any decision on what actions might be taken. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting a little longer, but it\u2019s clearly a shock for us,\" Jammes said.",
      "That meshes with Switzerland\u2019s overall approach: Despite hefty 31% U.S. tariffs slapped on Swiss goods -- well more than the 20% faced by exports from European Union \u2013 the government in Bern is taking a cautious approach for now. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against US tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2013 a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million \u2013 and U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",
      "The atmosphere remained bubbly at Festichoc, where eager shoppers nibbled chocolate squares and ogled at chocolate Easter bunny and egg sculptures at the annual gathering in the Geneva town of Versoix.",
      "Jammes, of Canonica, expressed hope that the \u201cloyal clientele\u201d in the United States would remain faithful, but she said \u201cI put myself in the consumer\u2019s shoes\u201d and realized a pocketbook pinch might dissuade many shoppers.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see why I would pay $45 tomorrow for a box (of chocolates) that I\u2019d pay $30 for today,\u201d she said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very complicated issue.\u201d",
      "The Swiss chocolate industry association Chocosuisse has expressed its disappointment over the Trump tariffs, even though it can still count on the domestic market: The Swiss are among the world's top consumers of chocolate, scarfing down more than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) per year.",
      "\u201cIt is completely incomprehensible that Switzerland is targeted by these tariffs,\u201d Chocosuisse said, adding that it was taking the situation \u201cvery seriously\u201d and decried how the U.S measure \u201chits our businesses hard and represents a heavy burden that will weigh on exports to the United States.\u201d",
      "Philippe Pascoet, a chocolatier from Geneva, lamented a sharp increase in cocoa prices over the last six months, and said the U.S. market has always been tricky for smaller producers.",
      "\u201cTrump now has wanted to impose taxes on imported products. But it has always been complicated to send chocolate to the United States, just for sanitary reasons,\" he said. \"They want to control what is imported into their country. So even people who used to order chocolate from us online often found it blocked at customs.\u201d",

      "Mega Millions players will get slightly better odds and should start seeing more billion-dollar jackpots, but at a cost \u2014 literally \u2014 with tickets for the multistate lottery more than doubling in price from $2 to $5",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Mega Millions players will get slightly better odds and should start seeing more billion-dollar jackpots, but at a cost \u2014 literally \u2014 with tickets for the multistate lottery jumping in price to $5.",
      "The price for playing Mega Millions more than doubled for drawings starting with Tuesday's, but lottery officials are betting that the swollen jackpots they're expecting will catch the public's attention and lead to an accompanying surge in sales",
      "\u201cPeople really want big jackpots,\u201d said Joshua Johnston, the Washington state lottery director who heads the Mega Millions game. \u201cWe expect to see a sales lift on this.\u201d",
      "The biggest change is the ticket price hike from $2 to $5. Lottery officials expect that jump to increase revenue from the twice-weekly game, enabling them to improve the odds of winning the jackpot from 1 in 303 million to 1 in 290 million.",
      "The higher ticket price also means the jackpot can start at $50 million, rather than the previous $20 million, and that the grand prize is expected to grow more quickly. Each time there isn\u2019t a big winner, the jackpot will jump by a larger amount. Officials expect it will more frequently top the $1 billion threshold that draws extra attention \u2014 and bigger sales.",
      "Under the new rules, prizes for tickets not matching all six numbers also will increase, with non-jackpot winners now guaranteed at least $10. Each ticket also will include a randomly assigned multiplier that can increase the prize by up to 10 times, a previous add-on feature that cost an extra $1. The multiplier doesn't apply to a jackpot.",
      "The new rules have two main goals: to address what the industry calls \u201cjackpot fatigue\" and to differentiate Mega Millions from Powerball, the other lottery draw game played across the country.",
      "Jackpot fatigue is the phenomenon under which prizes must grow to enormous amounts before most players will take note and buy a few tickets. These days, a $300 million prize that once drew lines at mini-marts barely registers.",
      "With the new rules, officials expect those average winning jackpots to climb from about $450 million to $800 million, Johnston said. And they believe that even lottery fatigue is no match for the more frequent billion-dollar prize.",
      "\u201cWhen you get to a billion people are like, \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s a whole lot of money,'\u201d Johnston said.",
      "Lottery officials said there is a clear correlation between bigger jackpots and higher sales, but not everyone who plays is swayed by the bigger pots.",
      "Sandie Yeaman, of Omaha, Nebraska, expressed puzzlement at the connection.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be satisfied with $1 million, and so would others,\" she said. \"One person winning $50 million is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Mega Millions will be the country's most expensive lottery draw game, where random numbers are selected to determine a winner.",
      "Still, that price is far less than scratch tickets offered by some states. In Texas, for example, some scratch tickets cost $100 each.",
      "Outside the U.S., the El Gordo Christmas lottery in Spain limits the number of tickets sold and charges 20 euros (nearly $22) for a partial ticket and 200 euros (nearly $220) for a full ticket.",
      "The higher Mega Millions price left Saeedith Williams, of East Point, Georgia, unsure if he'll keep buying several tickets per week. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll buy one ticket a week now that it\u2019s $5 a ticket,\u201d he said.",
      "After the new rules are implemented, the two lottery games that once were remarkably similar now will have some key differences.",
      "The biggest contrast will be the cost, as Powerball will stick with its $2 tickets \u2014 $3 in Idaho and Montana where they require a special prize bundle.",
      "With that smaller ticket price will come smaller minimal prizes, starting at $4, or less than half the lowest Mega Millions prize. But Powerball players will still be able to pay an extra dollar for \u201cPower Play,\u201d a random multiplier that, as in Mega Millions, can increase all but the grand prize.",
      "Powerball drawings will continue to be three times a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday and Saturday nights \u2014 while Mega Millions will hold drawings on Tuesday and Friday.",
      "The changes will bring the two games' jackpot odds a little closer, with Powerball jackpot odds of 1 in 292.2 million just a bit worse than the new Mega Millions odds.",
      "For players, it's a chance to spend a little money on a dream of incredible riches while acknowledging the reality that it almost certainly won't happen.",
      "For the 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands where Mega Millions is played, the game raises money for a variety of services, such as education scholarships. Local lottery agencies run the game in each jurisdiction and decisions about how the profits are divvied up are written into state law.",

      "Local communities say they\u2019re already experiencing harm from the government-backed project, which environmental watchdogs say is the largest current planned deforestation operation in the world.",
      "A vast tropical archipelago stretching across the equator, Indonesia is home to the world\u2019s third-largest rainforest, home to many endangered species of wildlife and plants, including orangutans, elephants and giant forest flowers. Some live nowhere else.",
      "Indonesia has been building food estates, massive plantations designed to improve the country's food security for decades, with varying level of success. The concept was revived by former President Joko Widodo during his 2014- 2024 administration.",
      "The current president, Prabowo Subianto, has expanded such projects to include crops to produce bioethanol, a renewable fuel made from plants like sugar cane or corn, in pursuit of Indonesia's ambition to improve its energy mix and develop more renewable sources.",
      "\u201cI am confident that within four to five years at the latest, we will achieve food self-sufficiency,\u201d Prabowo said in October 2024. \u201cWe must be self-sufficient in energy and we have the capacity to achieve this.\"",
      "Biofuels, such as bioethanol, play an important role in decarbonizing transport by providing a low-carbon solution for sectors that heavily rely on fossil fuels such as trucking, shipping and aviation, according to the International Energy Agency. But the agency also cautions expansion of biofuel should have minimal impact on land-use, food and other environmental factors in order to be developed sustainably.",
      "That's of particular concern in Indonesia, where more than 74 million hectares (285,715 square miles) of Indonesian rainforest \u2014 an area twice the size of Germany \u2014 have been logged, burned or degraded for development of palm oil, paper and rubber plantations, nickel mining and other commodities since 1950, according to Global Forest Watch.",
      "Indonesia has vast potential for bioethanol production due to its extensive agricultural land but currently lacks sustainable feedstocks, like sugarcane and cassava. A previous attempt to introduce bioethanol-blended fuel in 2007 was discontinued a few years later due to a lack of feedstock supply.",
      "Since then, the government has accelerated work on its food and energy estate mega-project, which spans 4.3 million hectares (about 10.6 million acres) on the islands of Papua and Kalimantan. Experts say the combined size of the numerous project sites makes the mega-project the largest current deforestation project in the world.",

      "\u201cImagine every piece of vegetation in that area being completely cleared ... having all the trees and the wildlife erased from the landscape and replaced with a monoculture,\u201d said Glenn Horowitz, CEO of Mighty Earth. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a zone of death in one of the most vibrant spots on Earth.\u201d",
      "An unpublished government feasibility assessment obtained and reviewed by The Associated Press estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from clearing land for the project will total 315 million tons of C02 equivalent. An independent assessment by the Indonesia-based think tank Center of Economic and Law Studies estimated double that.",
      "Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather.",
      "Hashim Djojohadikusumo, Subianto's brother and envoy for energy and the environment, said the government will reforest 6.5 million hectares (16 million acres) of degraded and deforested land.",
      "\u201cThus, the food estate program continues while we mitigate the possible negative impacts with new programs, one of which is reforestation,\u201d he said.",
      "But experts warn that reforestation, while essential, cannot match the ecological benefits of old-growth ecosystems, which store vast amounts of carbon in their soils and biomass, regulate water cycles and support biodiversity.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, which oversees the food and energy estate project, did not respond to requests for comment from The AP.

      "Now the Kenyan government and humanitarian agencies have come up with an ambitious plan for Kakuma to evolve into a city.",
      "Although it remains under the United Nations' management, Kakuma has been redesignated a municipality, one that local government officials later will run.",
      "It is part of broader goal in Kenya and elsewhere of incorporating refugees more closely into local populations and shifting from prolonged reliance on aid.",
      "The refugees in Kakuma eventually will have to fend for themselves, living off their incomes rather than aid. The nearest city is eight hours' drive away.",
      "Such self-reliance is not easy. Few refugees can become Kenyan citizens. A 2021 law recognizes their right to work in formal employment, but only a tiny minority are allowed to do so.",
      "Forbidden from keeping livestock because of the arid surroundings and the inability to roam widely, and unable to farm due to the lack of adequate water, many refugees see running a business as their only option.",
      "Startup businesses require capital, and interest rates on loans from banks in Kakuma are typically around 20%. Few refugees have the collateral and documentation needed to take out a loan.",
      "Denying them access to credit is a tremendous waste of human capital, said Julienne Oyler, who runs Inkomoko, a charity providing financial training and low-cost loans to African businesses, primarily in displacement-affected communities.",
      "\u201cWe find that refugee business owners actually have the characteristics that make world-class entrepreneurs,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThey are resilient. They are resourceful. They have access to networks. They have adaptability. In some ways, what refugees unfortunately have had to go through actually makes a really good business owner.\u201d",
      "Other options available include microloans from other aid groups or collective financing by refugee-run groups. However, the sums involved are usually insufficient for all but the smallest startups.",
      "One of Inkomoko\u2019s clients in Kakuma, Adele Mubalama, led seven young children \u2014 six of her own and an abandoned 12-year-old she found en route \u2014 on a hazardous journey to the camp through four countries after the family was forced to leave Congo in 2018.",
      "At the camp it took six months to find her husband, who had fled two months earlier, and six more to figure out how to make a living.",
      "\u201cIt was difficult to know how to survive,\u201d Mubalama said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to get jobs and there were no business opportunities.\u201d",
      "After signing up for a tailoring course with a Danish charity, she found herself making fabric masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Able to borrow from Inkomoko at half the rate charged by banks, she expanded, taking on 26 employees and buying new sewing machines. Last year she made a profit of $8,300 \u2014 a huge amount when many refugees live on allowances or vouchers of about $10 or less a month.",
      "Another beneficiary is Mesfin Getahun, a former soldier who fled Ethiopia for Kakuma in 2001 after helping students who had protested against the government. He has grown his \u201cJesus is Lord\u201d shops, which sell everything from groceries to motorcycles, into Kakuma\u2019s biggest retail chain. That's thanks in part to $115,000 in loans from Inkomoko.",
      "Trading with other towns is also essential. Inkomoko has linked refugee businesses with suppliers in Eldoret, a city 300 miles (482 kilometers) to the south, to cut out expensive middlemen and help embed Kakuma into Kenya's economy.",
      "Some question the vision of Kakuma becoming a thriving, self-reliant city.",
      "Rahul Oka, an associate research professor with the University of Notre Dame said it lacks the resources \u2014 particularly water \u2014 and infrastructure to sustain a viable economy that can rely on local production.",
      "\u201cYou cannot reconstruct an organic economy by socially engineering one,\u201d said Oka, who has studied economic life at Kakuma for many years.",
      "Two-way trade remains almost nonexistent. Suppliers send food and secondhand clothes to Kakuma, but trucks on the return journey are usually empty.",

      "Unless this is addressed, solutions offering greater opportunities to refugees cannot deliver meaningful transformation for most of them, he said.",

      "SEOUL. South Korea -- The United States has blocked imports of sea salt products from a major South Korean salt farm accused of using slave labor, becoming the first trade partner to take punitive action against a decadeslong problem on salt farms in remote islands off South Korea\u2019s southwest coast.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a withhold release order against the Taepyung salt farm, saying information \u201creasonably indicates\u201d the use of forced labor at the company in the island county of Sinan, where most of South Korea\u2019s sea salt products are made.",
      "Under the order issued on April 2, CBP personnel at all U.S. ports of entry are required to detain sea salt products sourced from the farm.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries didn\u2019t immediately comment on CBP\u2019s move on Monday.",
      "Taepyung is the largest salt farm in Sinan, reportedly producing about 16,000 tons of salt annually, which accounts for approximately 6% of the country\u2019s total output, and is a major supplier to South Korean food companies. The farm, located on Jeungdo island in Sinan and leasing most of its salt fields to tenants, has been repeatedly accused of using forced labor, including in 2014 and 2021.",
      "The widespread slavery at Sinan\u2019s salt farms was exposed in 2014, when dozens of slavery victims \u2014 most of them with disabilities \u2014 were rescued from the islands following an investigation by mainland police. Some of their stories were documented by The Associated Press, which highlighted how slavery continued to thrive despite the exposure.",
      "CBP said it identified several signs of forced labor during its investigation of Taepyung, including \u201cabuse of vulnerability, deception, restriction of movement, retention of identity documents, abusive living and working conditions, intimidation and threats, physical violence, debt bondage, withholding of wages, and excessive overtime.\u201d",
      "Lawyer Choi Jung Kyu, part of a group of attorneys and activists who petitioned CBP to take action against Taepyung and other South Korean salt farms in 2022, expressed hope that the U.S. export ban would increase pressure on South Korea to take more effective steps to eliminate the slavery.",
      "\u201cSince the exposure of the problem in 2014, the courts have recognized the legal responsibility of the national government and local governments, but forced labor among salt farm workers has not been eradicated,\u201d Choi said. \u201cOur hope is that the export ban would force companies to strengthen due diligence over supply chains and lead to the elimination of human rights violations.\u201d",
      "Most of the salt farm slaves rescued in 2014 had been lured to the islands by \u201cman hunters\u201d and job brokers hired by salt farm owners, who would beat them into long hours of hard labor and confine them at their houses for years while providing little or no pay.",
      "The slavery was revealed in early 2014 when two police officers from the capital, Seoul, came to one of the Sinan islands disguised as tourists and pulled off a clandestine operation to rescue a victim who had been reported by his family as missing. One of the Seoul police officers told the AP they went undercover because of concerns about collaborative ties between the island\u2019s police and salt farm owners. Dozens of farm owners and job brokers were indicted, but no police or officials were punished despite allegations some knew about the slavery.",
      "In 2019, South Korea\u2019s Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that ordered the government to compensate three men who had been enslaved on Sinan\u2019s salt farms, acknowledging that local officials and police failed to properly monitor their living and working conditions.",
      "The salt farm slavery issue resurfaced in 2021 when around a dozen workers at Taepyung were discovered to have endured various labor abuses, including forced labor and delayed payments.",

      "Australia\u2019s conservative opposition party has withdrawn its election promises to prevent public servants from working from home and to slash federal jobs",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s opposition party Monday withdrew election promises to prevent public servants from working from home and to slash more than one-in-five federal public sector jobs.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton announced his conservative Liberal Party had dropped its pledge that public servants would be required to work in their offices five days a week except in exceptional circumstances.",
      "\u201cI think we made a mistake in relation to this policy,\u201d Dutton told Nine Network television. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that we say that and recognize it and our intention was to make sure that where taxpayers are working hard and their money is being spent to pay wages that it's being spent efficiently.\"",
      "The opposition also withdrew a promise to use forced redundancy payments to slash 41,000 jobs from the 185,000 positions in the Australian Public Service. The reductions would instead be achieved through natural attrition and an employment freeze, he said.",
      "Dutton\u2019s announcements were the first significant policy shifts since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the May 3 election last month.",
      "Albanese urged voters not to believe that Dutton now supported flexible work arrangements for public servants.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s now pretending that that program won\u2019t proceed,\u201d Albanese told reporters.",
      "Members of the center-left Labor Party government have accused their conservative opponents of mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk who has spearheaded the so-called Department of Government Efficiency efforts to downsize and overhaul the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cThis is DOGE-y Dutton taking his cues and policies straight from the U.S.,\u201d Treasurer Jim Chalmers said last week.",
      "The government had argued that the opposition\u2019s policy to reduce workplace flexibility would disproportionately disadvantage women because they often had greater child care responsibilities.",

      "This spring homebuying season is shaping up to be more favorable for home shoppers than it\u2019s been in recent years \u2014 as long as they can afford to buy",
      "LOS ANGELES -- This spring homebuying season is shaping up to be more favorable for home shoppers than it's been in recent years \u2014 as long as they can afford to buy.",
      "Home prices are rising more slowly. Mortgage rates remain elevated, but have been mostly easing and could be headed lower if the U.S. economic outlook continues to darken over the Trump administration's widespread tariffs, which have rattled financial markets and stoked fears of a recession.",
      "Most importantly, the number of homes on the market is up sharply from a year ago.",
      "While the inventory of homes for sale nationally is still low by historical standards, active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 surged 28.5% last month from a year earlier, according to data from Realtor.com. Listings jumped between 44% and 68% in many large metro areas, including San Diego, Las Vegas, Atlanta and Washington D.C.",
      "As homes take longer to sell, prices have started dropping in many markets. The median listing price was down last month from a year earlier in most of the nation's biggest 50 metro areas, including a more than 6% drop in Austin, Miami and Kansas City.",
      "These trends should give prospective homebuyers more leverage as they negotiate with sellers this spring, though they are unlikely to be a game-changer for many aspiring homeowners priced out of the market after years of soaring prices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little hard to say that it\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, but I\u2019d call it a much more balanced market than it\u2019s been in the last couple of years, where it\u2019s really been a predominantly seller\u2019s market,\u201d said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "Ryan Vasko and his wife, Whitney, recently navigated both sides of the housing market equation in their move from Oregon to Colorado.",
      "In December, the couple sold their three-bedroom, one-bath house in Portland for $505,000. That was $10,000 below their list price, but still above the $500,000 minimum they hoped to get.",
      "At the same time, the couple searched for a home in the Denver metro area, which is among the markets that\u2019s had the biggest increase in homes for sale this year. Active listings soared 67.3% in March from a year earlier. As listings jumped, the median listing price fell 5.6% to $585,000.",
      "Last month, the Vaskos closed the deal on a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in Littleton, Colorado, about 10 miles south of Denver, that had been on the market at least three weeks.",
      "\u201cWe got under contract week one, we found out we were pregnant week two and we put an offer on this house week three,\u201d said Vasko, 41, a creative director at an advertising agency.",
      "The price: $680,000, or $5,000 above the list price. Still, the seller agreed to cover the cost of lowering the couple\u2019s 6.9% mortgage rate for the first two years of the loan to 4.9% and 5.9%, respectively.",
      "\u201cIt gives us a little wiggle room, if we need it,\u201d said Vasko, noting that he\u2019s hoping to eventually refinance to a lower fixed rate.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.",
      "Last year, higher mortgage rates dampened the start of the spring homebuying season. This year, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is down to 6.6% from just over 7% in mid-January, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac, although that\u2019s still elevated relative to the 2-year low of about 6% it fell to in September.",
      "Another plus for buyers: Lower prices. The median listing price fell in March from a year earlier in 32 of the 50 largest metro areas, including Kansas City, San Francisco, Miami and San Diego. Nationally, it was $424,900 last month, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "The market shift may give home shoppers more leverage when sellers ask that buyers waive home inspections. Sellers may also be more willing to pay for closing costs, contribute cash to make repairs or make other concessions, real estate agents say.",
      "\u201cPretty much every buyer is asking for concessions, unless they know that they are in a multiple offer situation,\u201d said Afton Hartmann, a Redfin agent in Denver.",
      "Such situations, although less common than a few years ago, still exist.",
      "Gilad Hoffman, executive director at a synagogue, knew his home search was over when he spotted a four-bedroom, 2.5-bath house for sale in Escondido, 30 miles northeast of San Diego. He felt the home, listed by the estate of its late owner for $1.079 million, was \u201cseverely underpriced.\u201d",
      "Hoffman, 41, paid $13,000 above the asking price for the home in February as he fended off bids from three other prospective buyers -- including one offering to pay all cash.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates didn\u2019t dissuade Hoffman. He accepted a 7% rate in exchange for a credit from his lender to put toward closing costs.",
      "\u201cMy philosophy going into the whole thing was: get into something now that you can afford with these high interest rates,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cHopefully in two years, they\u2019ll come down and then you can refinance. And that\u2019s still my intention.\u201d",
      "Despite some buyer-friendly trends, the housing market remains largely out of reach for many Americans, especially first-time buyers who don't have home equity gains to put toward a new home. While home price growth has been slowing, the decline is negligible against the 47% gain in prices over the last five years.",
      "And while home listings are up, many more are needed to return the market to more of a balance between buyers and sellers. Consider, there were 1.24 million unsold homes on the market at the end of February. While up 17% from a year earlier, that's still about 44% below the 2.21 million monthly average going back to 1999, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.",
      "As of January, a household earning the median U.S. annual income of $79,223 would have to spend 47% of that to cover payments on a home at the median price of $390,333. That share of income matches the highest it has ever been on records going back to 2005, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. When the annual cost of homeownership exceeds 30% of the median U.S. household income, it\u2019s considered unaffordable by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.",
      "If the decline in mortgage rates accelerates in coming months, that would boost homebuyers' purchasing power.",
      "Economic forecasts generally have the average rate on a 30-year mortgage staying around 6.5% this year, but those forecasts may be outdated now.",
      "A sharp downward move last week in the 10-year Treasury yield as bond investors reacted to rapidly escalating trade war between the U.S. and nations around the globe points to lower mortgage rates.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which banks use as a guide to pricing home loans, dropped to 4.01% Friday, its lowest level since October, as global trade tensions escalated.",
      "Still, tariffs are typically inflationary, and the 10-year Treasury yield tends to rise on expectations of higher inflation. That could keep mortgage rates where they are, or nudge them higher.",
      "If the trade war worries do pave the way for further mortgage rate drops, \u201cthose lower rates may be cold comfort to prospective buyers who are increasingly worried about job security and inflation,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump said Sunday that he won't back down on his sweeping tariffs on imports from most of the world unless countries even out their trade with the U.S., digging in on his plans to implement the taxes that have sent financial markets reeling, raised fears of a recession and upended the global trading system.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said he didn't want global markets to fall, but also that he wasn't concerned about the massive sell-off either, adding, \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\u201d",
      "His comments came as global financial markets appeared on track to continue sharp declines once trading resumes Monday, and after Trump's aides sought to soothe market concerns by saying more than 50 nations had reached out about launching negotiations to lift the tariffs.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Trump said. \"They\u2019re dying to make a deal. And I said, we\u2019re not going to have deficits with your country. We\u2019re not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We\u2019re going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\u201d",
      "The higher rates are set to be collected beginning Wednesday, ushering in a new era of economic uncertainty with no clear end in sight. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said unfair trade practices are not \u201cthe kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.\u201d The United States, he said, must see \u201cwhat the countries offer and whether it's believable.\u201d",
      "Trump, who spent the weekend in Florida playing golf, posted online that \u201cWE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d His Cabinet members and economic advisers were out in force Sunday defending the tariffs and downplaying the consequences for the global economy.",
      "\u201cThere doesn\u2019t have to be a recession. Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week?\" Bessent said. \u201cWhat we are looking at is building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.\u201d",
      "U.S. stock futures dropped on Sunday night as the tariffs continued to roil the markets. S&P 500 futures were down 2.5% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 2.1%. Nasdaq futures were down 3.1%. Even the price of bitcoin, which held relatively stable last week, fell nearly 6% Sunday.",
      "Asian shares, meanwhile, nosedived. Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 index lost nearly 8% shortly after the market opened. By midday, it was down 6%. A circuit breaker briefly suspended trading of Topix futures after an earlier sharp fall in U.S. futures. Chinese markets also tumbled, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng dropping 9.4%, while the Shanghai Composite index lost 6.2%.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff blitz, announced April 2, fulfilled a key campaign promise as he acted without Congress to redraw the rules of global trade. It was a move decades in the making for Trump, who has long denounced foreign trade deals as unfair to the U.S. He is gambling that voters will be willing to endure higher prices for everyday items to enact his economic vision.",
      "Countries are scrambling to figure out how to respond to the tariffs, with China and others retaliating quickly.",
      "Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett acknowledged that other countries are \u201cangry and retaliating,\u201d and, he said, \u201cby the way, coming to the table.\u201d He cited the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative as reporting that more than 50 nations had reached out to the White House to begin talks.",
      "Adding to the turmoil, the new tariffs are hitting American allies and adversaries alike, including Israel, which is facing a 17% tariff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House and speak at a press conference with Trump on Monday, with his office saying the tariffs would be a point of discussion with Trump along with the war in Gaza and other issues.",
      "Another American ally, Vietnam, a major manufacturing center for clothing, has also been in touch with the administration about the tariffs. Trump said Vietnam\u2019s leader said in a telephone call that his country \u201cwants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.\u201d And a key European partner, Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, said she disagreed with Trump\u2019s move but was \u201cready to deploy all the tools \u2014 negotiating and economic \u2014 necessary to support our businesses and our sectors that may be penalized.\"",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made clear there was no postponing tariffs that are days away.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are coming. Of course they are,\u201d he said, adding that Trump needed to reset global trade. But he committed only to having them \u201cdefinitely\u201d remain \u201cfor days and weeks.\u201d",
      "In Congress, where Trump\u2019s Republican Party has long championed free trade, the tariff regiment has been met with applause but also significant unease.",
      "Several Republican senators have already signed onto a new bipartisan bill that would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would then have to approve the tariffs within 60 days, or they would expire. Nebraska GOP Rep. Don Bacon said Sunday that he would introduce a House version of the bill, saying that Congress needs to restores its powers over tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe gave some of that power to the executive branch. I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake,\u201d said Bacon, adding that getting a measure passed would be challenging unless the financial markets continue to react negatively and other indicators such as inflation and unemployment shift.",
      "Wyoming's John Barrasso, the No. 2 member of the Senate's GOP leadership, said Trump is \u201cdoing what he has every right to do.\u201d But, he acknowledged, \u201cthere is concern, and there\u2019s concern across the country. People are watching the markets.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019ll be a discussion in the Senate,\u201d Barrasso said of the tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ll see which way the discussion goes.\u201d",
      "Trump's government cost-cutting guru, billionaire businessman Elon Musk, had been relatively silent on Trump\u2019s tariffs, but said at a weekend event in Italy that he would like to see the U.S. and Europe move to \"a zero-tariff situation.\u201d The comment from the Tesla owner who leads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency drew a rebuke from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "\u201cElon, when he is on his DOGE lane, is great. But we understand what's going on here. We just have to understand. Elon sells cars,\u201d Navarro said. He added: \u201cHe's simply protecting his own interest as any business person would do.\u201d",
      "Trump indicated he disagreed with Musk, saying Sunday of the European Union, \u201cThey want to talk, but there\u2019s no talk unless they pay us a lot of money on a yearly basis.\u201d",
      "Lawrence Summers, an economist who was treasury secretary under Democratic President Bill Clinton, said Trump and his economic team are sending contradictory messages if they say they are interested in reviving manufacturing while still being open to negotiating with trade partners.",
      "If other countries eliminate their tariffs, and the U.S, does, too, he said, \"it\u2019s just making a deal, then we don\u2019t raise any revenue nor do we get any businesses to relocate to the United States. If it\u2019s a permanent revenue source and trying to get businesses to relocate to the United States, then we\u2019re going to have these tariffs permanently.

      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d is smashing all box office projections",
      "Hollywood needed \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d to be a hit, and it delivered in its opening weekend, significantly narrowing this year's box office deficit.",
      "No one guessed just how big it would be. In its first few days in theaters, the movie earned a staggering $157 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. Internationally, it\u2019s looking at an additional $144 million for a global debut of $301 million. And with school spring breaks ongoing, \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d is just getting started.",
      "Not only is it the biggest opening of 2025, \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d also broke the record for a video game adaptation, a distinction previously held by \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\" ($146 million). Going into the weekend, analysts projected \u201cMinecraft\u201d might hit $80 million. Instead, it nearly doubled that figure.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed in the movie business, but an offering based on the best-selling video game of all time makes for a good start. It hardly mattered that the block-based game doesn\u2019t exactly have a narrative. Many of its 200 million active monthly players turned out in droves anyway.",
      "The PG-rated movie, directed by Jared Hess (\u201cNapoleon Dynamite\u201d), was a co-production of Legendary Entertainment and Warner Bros. It cost a reported $150 million to make, not including marketing and promotion expenses. Jack Black and Jason Momoa lead the ensemble cast (Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen). Their characters are transported into an imaginative dimension called the Overworld and need to go on a dangerous, and immensely silly, adventure to get home.",
      "Critics were largely mixed on \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d but audiences gave it a more promising B+ CinemaScore and 4/5 stars in PostTrak exit polls. Men made up around 62% of the audience, and 64% were under the age of 25. Warner Bros. went big on its release, opening the film in 4,263 locations domestically and 36,000 screens internationally.",
      "\u201cYounger audiences love going to the movie theater, believe it or not,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWe thought this was an audience who would migrate to the small screens, but this is the perfect small screen to big screen alliance. It became a must-see theatrical event. Awareness was off the charts.\u201d",
      "Video game adaptations have had some pivotal successes in recent years, including \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d the \u201cSonic\u201d series and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s.\u201d",
      "\u201cVideo games were once a genre that had very mixed results at the box office, but the code has finally been cracked,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Second place at this week's box office went to the Jason Statham action pic \u201cA Working Man,\" which added $7.3 million in its second weekend. Third place was occupied by the second installment in the episodic \u201cThe Chosen: Last Supper\u201d series. Part two (made up of episodes three through five) earned $6.7 million over the weekend. The third and final batch of episodes arrive in theaters on April 11.",
      "\u201cSnow White\u201d slid to fourth place in its third weekend, bringing in $6.1 million. It's now made over $168 million globally.",
      "It\u2019s been a difficult start to 2025 for Hollywood and movie theaters, with disappointments including \u201cSnow White\u201d and \u201cMickey 17.\u201d But one hit can change the tides significantly, especially with in-theater marketing pushes in full swing for the pivotal summer movie season, which kicks off the first weekend in May.",
      "Before this weekend, the box office was running at a 13% deficit compared with last year. Now the gap is down to 5%.",

      "Some of the more than a dozen states that cover the high cost of GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound through Medicaid or state employee insurance programs are scrambling to lessen the budgetary squeeze from fast-rising costs",
      "States increasingly struggling to cover the rising cost of popular GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, Ozempic and Zepbound are searching for ways to get out from under the budgetary squeeze that took them by surprise.",
      "One solution some policymakers may try is restricting the number of people on Medicaid who can use the pricey diabetes drugs for weight-loss purposes.",
      "Pennsylvania's Medicaid coverage of the drugs is expected to cost $1.3 billion in 2025 \u2014 up from a fraction of that several years ago \u2014 and is contributing to projections of a multibillion-dollar budget deficit. The state is thinking about requiring Medicaid patients who want to use GLP-1s for weight loss to meet a certain number on the body-mass index or try diet and exercise programs or less expensive medications first.",
      "\u201cIt is a medication that\u2019s gotten a lot of hype and a lot of press, and has become very popular in its use and it is wildly expensive,\u201d Dr. Val Arkoosh, Pennsylvania\u2019s human services secretary, told a state House hearing in March.",
      "At least 14 states already cover the cost of GLP-1 medications for obesity treatment for patients on Medicaid, the federal health care program for people with low incomes. Democrats and Republicans in at least a half-dozen other states floated bills this year to require the same coverage, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Some bills have stalled while others remain alive, including a proposal in Arkansas requiring GLP-1s to be covered under Medicaid when prescribed specifically for weight loss. Iowa lawmakers are thinking about ordering a cost-benefit analysis before making the commitment. Already, West Virginia and North Carolina ended programs in 2024 that provided coverage for state employees, citing cost concerns.",
      "\u201cIt is very expensive,\u201d said Jeffrey Beckham, the state budget director in Connecticut, where Medicaid coverage of the drugs for weight loss may be scrapped entirely. \u201cOther states are coming to that conclusion, as well as some private carriers.\u201d",
      "Overall Medicaid spending on GLP-1 drugs \u2014 before partial rebates from drug manufacturers \u2014 jumped from $577.3 million in 2019 to $3.9 billion in 2023, according to a November report from KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues. The number of prescriptions for the drugs increased by more than 400% during that same time period. The average annual cost per patient for a GLP-1 drug is $12,000, according to a Peterson-KFF tracker.",
      "About half of Americans \u201cstrongly\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favor having Medicare and Medicaid cover weight-loss drugs for people who have obesity, a recent AP-NORC poll showed, with about 2 in 10 opposed the idea and about one-quarter with a neutral view.",
      "But Medicare does not cover GLP-1s, and the Trump administration said Friday that wouldn't put into place a proposed rule by presidential predecessor Joe Biden to cover the medications under Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug coverage. Biden\u2019s proposal was expensive: It would have included coverage for all state- and federally funded Medicaid programs, costing taxpayers as much as $35 billion over next decade.",
      "States that do provide coverage have tried to manage costs by putting prescribing limits on the GLP-1s. There's also some evidence that if Medicaid patients lose weight with the drugs, they'll be healthier and less expensive to cover, said Tracy Zvenyach of Obesity Action, an advocacy group that urges states to provide coverage.",
      "Zvenyach also stressed how it's unclear whether patients will need to regularly take these drugs for the rest of their lives \u2014 a key cost concern raised by public officials. \u201cSomeone may have to be on treatment for over the course of their lifetime,\" she said. \"But we don\u2019t know exactly what that regimen would look like.\u201d",
      "About 40% of adults in the U.S. have obesity, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity can cause hypertension, Type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol, which lead to greater risks of things like stroke and heart attacks.",
      "Dr. Adam Raphael Rom, a physician at Greater Philadelphia Health Action, a network of health centers in the city, said most of his patients who take GLP-1s are covered by Medicaid and some are non-diabetics who use it for weight loss.",
      "\u201cI had one patient tell me that it\u2019s like, changed her relationship to food,\" Rom said. \u201cI\u2019ve had patients lose like 20, 40, 60 pounds.\"",
      "But obesity experts have told The Associated Press that as many as 1 in 5 people may not lose the amount of weight that others have seen come off. And in a recent survey of state Medicaid directors conducted by KFF, a health policy research organization, they said cost and potential side effects are among their concerns.",
      "The debate over coverage coincides with rising Medicaid budgets and the prospect of losing federal funding \u2014 with congressional Republicans considering siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade.",
      "Connecticut is facing a $290 million Medicaid account deficit, and Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont proposed doing away with a 2023 requirement that Medicaid cover GLP-1s for severe obesity, though the state has never fully abided by the law due to the cost.",
      "Starting June 14, though, state Medicaid patients will be required to have a Type 2 diabetes diagnosis to get the drugs covered. Lamont also is pushing for the state to cover two less expensive oral medications approved by the FDA for weight loss, as well as nutrition counseling.",
      "Sarah Makowicki, 42, tried the other medications and said she suffered serious side effects. The graduate student and statehouse intern is working on a bill that would restore the full GLP-1 coverage for her and others.",
      "Sara Lamontagne, a transgender woman with a disability who is on Medicaid, said she regained weight when her coverage for GLP-1 medication was cut off in the past. She said she went from 260 pounds to over 300, heavier than she had ever been.",
      "\u201cSo, it\u2019s a horrible game to be played, to be going back and and forth,\u201d said Lamontagne, whose attempts to appeal the state's recent denial of her Ozempic prescription refill have been unsuccessful.",
      "Makowicki said GLP-1 drugs combined with weight-loss surgery helped her change her life: She's had knee-replacement surgery and lost over 200 pounds.",
      "\u201cI am a different person from what I was five years ago,\u201d Makowicki said. \u201cNot only in my physical space, but also mentally.\u201d",

      "The biggest-ticket implications of President Donald Trump's tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention",
      "NEW YORK -- Economy Candy\u2019s shelves brim with sweets from around the world \u2013 gummies from Germany, lollipops from Spain, chocolates from Japan and a panoply of candies from across the U.S.",
      "Standing amid it all, columns of bright jellybeans to his left and exotic Kit Kats to his right, owner Mitchell Cohen is quick with his assessment of how many of this shop\u2019s 2,000-plus items are affected by the historic round of tariffs announced by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cI think all of them,\u201d Cohen says at his store on New York's Lower East Side.",
      "Few corners of the American economy are untouched, directly or indirectly, by the sweeping tariffs being imposed by Trump. Even a little store like Economy Candy.",
      "Cohen had just begun to feel a barrage of inflation-driven price increases from suppliers ease when the tariff threats arrived. For a business with a name like Economy Candy, he wants to remain affordable but fears how high some prices may have to climb in the coming months.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s gonna be another round of this hyperinflation on some items,\u201d says 39-year-old Cohen. \u201cIf we\u2019re putting tariffs everywhere, it is going to go up.\u201d",
      "Stepping into Economy Candy feels like a time warp. Its name is emblazoned on a sign in a vintage, blaring red script, and crossing below its green-and-white striped awning, past the bins of Smarties, butterscotches and Lemonheads in the front window, an indecipherable sweetness fills the air, oldies music sounds overhead and customers mill around stacks of candy bars they forgot still existed.",
      "It represents just a blip in the country\u2019s $54 billion candy industry. But it was already feeling the weight of surges in prices of cocoa and other ingredients before tariffs were layered on.",
      "Candy and gum prices are up about 34% from five years ago and 89% from 2005, according to Consumer Price Index data. Price, according to the National Confectioners Association, has become the top factor in consumers\u2019 candy purchase decisions, outweighing a buyer's mood.",
      "About a third of Economy Candy\u2019s products are imported, crowded on shelves and tables near the store\u2019s rear. There aren\u2019t just \u201cmore German Haribo varieties than the Haribo store in Germany,\u201d as Cohen claims, but gummies the brand makes in France, Austria and Britain.",
      "They have every Milka bar they can find in Switzerland, every type of Leone hard candies that Italy churns out and as many exotic Kit Kats from Japan as they can fit.",
      "On products like these, the tariffs\u2019 toll is obvious.",
      "Pistachio Snickers bars are from India, now subject to 26% tariffs, while passion fruit mousse Snickers are from Portugal, now under the 20% European Union levies.",
      "But even an American-made Snickers isn\u2019t immune.",
      "While the bars may roll off conveyors in Texas, they rely on ingredients from around the globe. Sourcemap, which tracks supply chains, says Snickers bars are made with chocolate from Guyana, peanuts from Argentina and sugar from Brazil, wrapped up in packaging from Canada. All are now subjected to varying levels of tariffs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ingredients in there that have to come from other countries,\u201d says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade. \u201cUnless you\u2019re talking about something very simple from your local farmers market, almost every product relies on ingredients from elsewhere. Those indirect costs are really what\u2019s going to drive up prices.\u201d",
      "The story repeats with American candies across the store \u2013 the boxes of Nerds and bags of Sugar Babies and rolls of Smarties are all inextricably tied to the global supply chain.",
      "A table teeming with those domestic delicacies takes center stage near Economy Candy\u2019s entrance. Cohen took over the store from his parents, who took it over from their parents before. He got his first haircut in the store. He was behind the register as a child. He took his wife by on their first date.",
      "As a kid, everything on the store\u2019s centerpiece table of American treats cost 59 cents. By 2020, the price was $1.29, but customers who bought a whole box paid a discounted rate of $1 per piece.",
      "Now, Cohen can\u2019t even get them wholesale at that price.",
      "Today, he sells the items on the table for $1.59. Cohen calls the selection a \u201closs leader\u201d but thinks it's important to showcase his store's affordability. Once the tariffs are fully implemented, he\u2019s not sure he\u2019ll be able to put off price increases.",
      "\u201cWhen your margins are coming down and your dollar doesn\u2019t go as far at the end of the day, you really start to feel it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want anyone to come into Economy Candy and not think that it\u2019s economical.\u201d",
      "The biggest-ticket implications of the tariff blitz understandably gain the most attention \u2013 the thousands of dollars a car\u2019s price tag may grow, the tens of thousands that disappear from a retirement account in a single day. But here among the root beer barrels and licorice strands, you're reminded that small-dollar items are affected too, and so are the families selling them.",
      "At its birth, the business Cohen\u2019s grandfather started focused on shoe and hat repairs. But in the wake of the Great Depression, when few in a neighborhood of crowded tenements had money for such fixes, the business pivoted.",
      "Candy, once relegated to a cart out front, took over the store.",
      "In the 88 years since, business hasn't always been Chuckles and Zagnuts. The Sept. 11 attacks kept tourists away and had sales sagging and the pandemic closed the store and forced it to pivot to online sales.",
      "If tariffs upend things, Cohen isn\u2019t sure how he might adapt again. He sells products that aren\u2019t made in America and he sells American products made with ingredients from across the globe. He had just been making headway on beginning international sales, but the web of tariff rules may make it impossible.",
      "The average U.S. tariff could rise to nearly 25% if the import taxes Trump put on goods from dozens of countries are fully implemented Wednesday. That would be the highest rate in more than a century, including tariffs widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression.",
      "Trump said imposing the tariffs amounted to a \u201cliberation day\u201d for a country that has been \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by friend and foe alike, insisting it was \u201cvery, very good news\u201d for the U.S.",
      "Cohen isn't sure how that can be true for a business like his.",
      "\u201cI can understand bringing manufacturing and bringing things back to America, but you know, we rely on raw materials that just aren\u2019t native to our country,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like I can get a green tea Japanese Kit Kat from an American company.\u201d",
      "As Cohen stood before mounds of strawberry candies in shiny wrappers and little cubes of caramel in cellophane, the first word of the tariff\u2019s concrete impact on him arrived. A French supplier emailed saying it was immediately imposing a 5% surcharge due to the tariffs, expressing regret for the move and hope that \u201cthe situation will be resolved swiftly.\u201d",
      "Cohen wore a smile anyway. He wants this to be a happy place for visitors.",
      "\u201cYou travel back to a time when nothing mattered,\u201d Cohen says, \"when you didn\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d",

      "About 45 years have passed since a state last eliminated its income tax on wages and salaries",
      "About 45 years have passed since a U.S. state last eliminated its income tax on wages and salaries. But with recent actions in Mississippi and Kentucky, two states now are on a path to do so, if their economies keep growing.",
      "The push to zero out the income tax is perhaps the most aggressive example of a tax-cutting trend that swept across states as they rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic with surging revenues and historic surpluses.",
      "But it comes during a time of greater uncertainty for states, as they wait to see whether President Donald Trump's cost cutting and tariffs lead to a reduction in federal funding for states and a downturn in the overall economy.",
      "Some fiscal analysts also warn the repeal of income taxes could leave states reliant on other levies, such as sales taxes, that disproportionately affect the poor.",
      "The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to levy income taxes. It was ratified by states in 1913. Since then, most states have adopted their own income taxes.",
      "Eight states currently charge no personal income tax: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming. A ninth state, Washington, charges no personal income tax on wages and salaries but does tax certain capital gains income over $270,000.",
      "When Alaska repealed its personal income tax in 1980, it did so because state coffers were overflowing with billions of dollars in oil money.",
      "Though income tax eliminations have been proposed elsewhere, they have not been successful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to go without an individual income tax if you\u2019ve never levied one,\" said Katherine Loughead, a senior analyst and research manager at the nonprofit Tax Foundation. \"But once you become dependent on that revenue, it is a lot more difficult to phase out or eliminate that tax.\u201d",
      "Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed a law gradually reducing the state's income tax rate from 4% to 3% by 2030 and setting state revenue growth benchmarks that could trigger additional incremental cuts until the tax is eliminated. The law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and raises the gasoline tax.",
      "If cash reserves are fully funded and revenue triggers are met each year, Mississippi's income tax could be gone by 2040.",
      "Supporters of an income tax repeal hope it will attract both businesses and residents, elevating the state\u2019s economy to the likes of Florida, Tennessee and Texas. Their theory is that when people pay less in income taxes, they will have more money to spend, thus boosting sales tax collections.",
      "The tax repeal \u201cputs us in a rare class of elite, competitive states,\u201d Reeves said in a statement. He added, \u201cMississippi has the potential to be a magnet for opportunity, for investment, for talent \u2013- and for families looking to build a better life.\u201d",
      "Mississippi is among the most impoverished states and relies heavily on federal funding. Democratic lawmakers warned the state could face a financial crises if cuts in federal funding come at the same time as state income tax reductions.",
      "The income tax provides \u201ca huge percentage of what the state brings in to fund things like schools and health care and services that everybody relies on,\u201d said Neva Butkus, senior analyst at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A 2022 Kentucky law reduced the state's income tax rate and set a series of revenue-based triggers that could gradually lower the tax to zero. But unlike in Mississippi, the triggers aren't automatic. Rather, the Kentucky General Assembly must approve each additional decrease in the tax rate.",
      "That has led to a series of tax-cutting measures, including two new laws this year. One implements the next tax rate reduction from 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. The second makes it easier to continue cutting the tax rate in the future by allowing smaller incremental reductions if revenue growth isn't sufficient to trigger a 0.5 percentage point reduction.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed the legislation for next year's tax cut but let the other measure passed by the Republican-led legislature become law without his signature. Beshear called it a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d bill, contending lawmakers had assured the guardrails for income tax reductions would remain in place while pushing for the 2026 tax cut, then later in the session altered the triggers for future years.",
      "New Hampshire and Tennessee already did not tax income from wages and salaries, but both states had taxed certain types of income.",
      "In 2021, Tennessee ended an income tax on interest from bonds and stock dividends that had been levied since 1929.",
      "New Hampshire halted its tax on interest and dividends at the start of this year.",
      "Some other states also are pushing to repeal income taxes. The Oklahoma House passed legislation in March that would gradually cut the personal income tax rate to zero if revenue growth benchmarks are met. That bill now is in the Senate.",
      "New Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, also wants to phase out the income tax. The House and Senate have advanced legislation that would take an incremental step by exempting capital gains income from taxes.",

      "Nations are trying to reach an agreement to charge commercial vessels a fee for their emissions in what would effectively be the world\u2019s first global carbon tax.",
      "The International Maritime Organization, which regulates international shipping, set a target for the sector to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by about 2050, and committed to ensuring that fuels with zero or near-zero emissions are used more widely. Its Marine Environment Protection Committee meets Monday through Friday in London.",
      "The committee, comprised of IMO member states, is working to approve proposed new global regulations to put a price on maritime greenhouse gas emissions and to set a marine fuel standard to phase in cleaner fuels.",
      "The measures are more than climate aspirations \u2013 they will become mandatory for ships operating globally, said IMO Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez, who thinks the industry must do more to cut carbon pollution. The committee will \u201cset the course for a net-zero future for the maritime sector,\u201d he told The Associated Press in a statement Thursday.",
      "The future of clean shipping hangs in the balance, said Emma Fenton, senior director for climate diplomacy at a U.K.-based climate change nonprofit, Opportunity Green. Fenton said a high price, simple flat-rate levy on shipping\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions is the only way to decarbonize the industry equitably.",
      "\u201cIf an agreement is reached, it would represent a huge moment of solidarity in the fight to tackle climate change,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cFor the first time, we will have, hopefully, an effective global framework tackling this international issue. Most emissions are tackled domestically.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Emissions from shipping have increased over the last decade \u2014 to about 3% of the global total according to the United Nations \u2014 as vessels have gotten much bigger, delivering more cargo per trip and using immense amounts of fuel oil.",
      "Maritime nations agreed in 2023 to slash emissions from the shipping industry, though several experts and nations were critical of the deal since it did not set 2050 as a hard date. The IMO is now in the process of adopting regulations to achieve the goals agreed to in 2023.",
      "A simple climate levy paired with a green fuel standard would help narrow the price gap between fossil fuels and green fuels, such as hydrogen, methanol and ammonia, according to the Global Maritime Forum, a nonprofit that works closely with the industry. Shipping relies heavily on fossil fuels and the sector won't transition off those on its own, said Jesse Fahnestock, who leads the forum\u2019s decarbonization work. And it will take time to build up a supply of e-fuels based on renewable electricity so investments need to happen now, he added.",
      "Most ships today run on heavy fuel oil, releasing carbon dioxide and other pollutants as it's burned. Dominguez has said that major decarbonizing requires an overhaul of shipping fuel.",
      "The Clean Shipping Coalition is calling on governments to commit to a high price on all ship emissions and a strong fuel standard. The alliance of environmental non-profits is also urging countries to revise the IMO's tool for measuring a ship's carbon intensity, to quantify and raise their efficiency transparently and drive down the amount of fuel burned long-term.",
      "Led by Pacific island nations, whose very existence is threatened by climate change, more than 60 countries support a flat levy per metric ton of emissions to reach net zero in a fair way. The shipping industry supports a fee, too. The International Chamber of Shipping represents over 80% of the world\u2019s merchant fleet. Its secretary general, Guy Platten, said a pricing mechanism for maritime emissions is a pragmatic solution and the most effective way to incentivize a rapid energy transition in shipping.",
      "Some countries, notably China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, want a credit trading model instead of a fixed levy, where ships get credits for staying under their emissions target and ships purchase credits if they go over. Other countries want a compromise between the two models.",
      "Some fear that anything short of a universal levy would jeopardize climate goals and allow wealthier ship owners to buy compliance while continuing to pollute. Ambassador Albon Ishoda, Marshall Islands\u2019 special envoy for maritime decarbonization, said IMO's climate targets are \u201cmeaningless\u201d without the levy. Revenue from a levy could be used to help developing countries transition to greener shipping, so they aren't left behind with dirty fuels and old ships.",
      "If the committee agrees and finalizes text for the regulations, they could be formally adopted in October and take effect in 2027. That could send a powerful signal that the green transition is happening and that it's possible for a global industry, according to the IMO.",

      "Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti warned that imposing retaliatory tariffs on the United States would be damaging for both Italy and Europe.",
      "Speaking at a business forum in Cernobbio, near Milan, Giorgetti said Saturday that Italy is working for a \u201cde-escalation\u201d with the U.S. following Trump\u2019s announcement of a general tariff of 20% on European Union countries.",
      "\u201cWe should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,\u201d Giorgetti said. \u201cOur message is that we need to avoid pushing the panic button. \u2026 We are following a pragmatic and rational approach.\u201d",
      "Giorgetti proposed the EU allow member states to raise spending by relaxing the bloc\u2019s fiscal rules.",
      "Italy has a very limited budget leeway, as the government forecast its giant debt rising through 2026 to almost 138% of GDP.",
      "\u201cThe Italian public debt means reduced budget room for our country, a constraint that must be taken into account in any decisions we make,\u201d Giorgetti said, also referring to EU plans to increase defense spending.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s says it will provide a $2.65 billion fund to aid industries most affected by U.S. tariffs.",
      "Taiwan has a trade surplus with the U.S., but much of it comes from Taiwanese industries trying to fulfill the U.S. demand for Taiwan\u2019s information technology products. Officials say Taiwan plans to negotiate with the U.S. on how the new tariff rate of 32% was determined and try to get a better deal.",
      "Premier Cho Jung-tai has been charged with working closely with industries that are impacted and to communicate the public about their plans to stabilize the economy. Cho said Friday that electronics and information technology, steel and metal, machinery, auto parts, construction materials and home appliances will feel \u201csignificant impacts.\u201d",
      "In the agricultural field, moth orchids, edamame and such fish as tilapia, common dolphinfish and bass will be hit the hardest, he said.",

      "While the world\u2019s leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina\u2019s right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) \u2014 Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \u201cAmerican Patriot\u201d gala.",
      "\u201cMake Argentina Great Again!\u201d Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \u201cwoke\u201d left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\u201cHe has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \u201cHe hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women\u2019s sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 most recently, the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he gifted Elon Musk a giant chain saw modeled after the power tool he wielded during his 2023 campaign \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Trump\u2019s tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Trump\u2019s pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\u201cAs you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\u201d Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president\u2019s name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\u201cWe do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\u201d Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Trump's announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina\u2019s largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \u201cTrump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\u201d",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \u201chighly productive\u201d meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund\u2019s biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \u201can informal meeting\u201d with Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, nonmeeting \u2014 with Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn\u2019t say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\u201cWhen I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your \u2018friend\u2019 Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \u201cWhat a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\u201d",

      "\u201cMustafa, shame on you,\u201d shouted Microsoft employee Ibtihal Aboussad as she walked toward the stage and Suleyman paused his speech. \u201cYou claim that you care about using AI for good but Microsoft sells AI weapons to the Israeli military. Fifty-thousand people have died and Microsoft powers this genocide in our region.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you for your protest, I hear you,\u201d Suleyman said. Aboussad continued, shouting that Suleyman and \u201call of Microsoft\u201d had blood on their hands. She also threw onto the stage a keffiyeh scarf, which has become a symbol of support for Palestinian people, before being escorted out of the event.",
      "A second protester, Microsoft employee Vaniya Agrawal, interrupted another part of the celebration during which Gates, Ballmer and current CEO Satya Nadella were on stage \u2014 the first public gathering since 2014 of the three men who have been Microsoft's CEO.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon. The story also contained details of an errant Israeli airstrike in 2023 that struck a vehicle carrying members of a Lebanese family, killing three young girls and their grandmother.",
      "In February, five Microsoft employees were ejected from a meeting with Nadella for protesting the contracts. While the February event was an internal meeting, Friday's protest was far more public \u2014 a livestreamed showcase of the company's past and future. Some employees also rallied outside the event Friday.",
      "\u201cWe provide many avenues for all voices to be heard,\" said a statement from the company Friday. \u201cImportantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not cause a business disruption. If that happens, we ask participants to relocate. We are committed to ensuring our business practices uphold the highest standards.\u201d",
      "Microsoft declined to say whether it was taking further action. Aboussad told the AP she hasn't yet heard anything from the company but she and Agrawal both lost access to their work accounts after the protest and have not been able to log back in, a possible indication that they were being fired.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Government staffing cuts have gutted a small U.S. health agency that aims to protect workers \u2014 drawing rebukes from firefighters, coal miners, medical equipment manufacturers and a range of others.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, a Cincinnati-based agency that is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is losing about 850 of its approximately 1,000 employees, according to estimates from a union and affected employees. Among those ousted were its director, Dr. John Howard, who had been in the job through three previous presidential administrations.",
      "The layoffs are stalling \u2014 and perhaps ending \u2014 many programs, including a firefighter cancer registry and a lab that is key to certifying respirators for many industries.",
      "The cuts are \u201ca very pointed attack on workers in this country,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the union local representing NIOSH employees in Cincinnati.",
      "Unions that represent miners, nurses, flight attendants and other professions have criticized the cuts, saying it will slow the identification and prevention of workplace dangers. Rallies in Cincinnati and other cities drew not only fired CDC employees but also members of unions representing teachers, postal workers and bricklayers, Niemeier-Walsh said.",
      "NIOSH doctors review and certify that 9/11 first responders who developed chronic illnesses could qualify for care under the federal government\u2019s World Trade Center Health Program, noted Andrew Ansbro, president of a union that represents New York City firefighters.",
      "\u201cDismantling NIOSH dishonors the memory of our fallen brothers and sisters and abandons those still battling 9/11-related illnesses,\u201d Ansbro said in a statement.",
      "NIOSH was created under a 1970 law signed by President Richard Nixon. It started operations the following year and grew to have offices and labs in eight cities, including Cincinnati; Pittsburgh; Spokane, Washington; and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "In the more than 50 years since, it has done pioneering research on indoor air quality in office buildings, workplace violence and occupational exposures to bloodborne infections.",
      "NIOSH investigators identified a new lung disease in workers at factories that made microwave popcorn, and helped assess what went wrong during the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster. It was recently involved in the CDC's response to measles, advising on measures to stop spread within hospitals.",
      "Some of its best-known work is related to mining. It trains and certifies doctors in how to test for black lung disease, and the agency conducts its own mobile screenings of miners. For years, NIOSH owned an experimental mine in Pennsylvania and two years ago announced it was developing a replacement research facility near Mace, West Virginia, that would feature tunnels and other mine structures.",
      "Its research and recommendations have served as the foundation for Department of Labor rules for worker protection, including one issued last year for coal miners that cuts by half the permissible exposures to poisonous silica dust.",
      "Studies have concluded NIOSH research helps the nation save millions of dollars each year in avoided workers\u2019 compensation and other costs.",
      "\u201cAny stoppage to this type of research and recommendations can impact all segments of the workforce,\u201d said Tessa Bonney, who teaches about occupational health at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",
      "NIOSH was swept up in the massive upheaval at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that includes about 10,000 layoffs, an anticipated reorganization and proposed budget cuts.",
      "Nonunionized NIOSH workers \u2014 mainly supervisors \u2014 were told to clean out their desks immediately. Bargaining unit employees got layoff notices, and were told their terminations would happen later this year.",
      "\u201cRight now we are trying to figure out chain of command,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said.",
      "An HHS spokesman, Andrew Nixon, said what\u2019s left of NIOSH will be moved into a newly created agency to be called the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that 20% of the people laid off from federal health agencies might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes, but the department has not detailed which parts of NIOSH were reduced or eliminated, and which will remain open.",
      "What\u2019s known about the cuts made so far was pieced together by employees affected by the layoffs and the union that represents them. They say almost every NIOSH program faced steep cuts or outright elimination.",
      "A firefighter cancer registry website went down Tuesday \u201cbecause there were no IT people left to staff the system,\u201d Niemeier-Walsh said.",
      "And at least some of the hundreds of mice and rats at a NIOSH lab in Morgantown likely will have to be destroyed because the layoffs put an abrupt, mid-experiment end to inhalation research there, said Cathy Tinney-Zara, a public health analyst who is president of the union local representing employees there.",
      "\u201cMillion of dollars of research, decades of research, is going down the drain,\u201d Tinney-Zara said.",
      "Some of the outcry from unions and industry has centered on the National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, a NIOSH office that tests and certifies fitted masks that protect workers from inhaling airborne dangers. (The N95 masks that became popular during the COVID-19 outbreak are named for a NIOSH standard.)",
      "Closing the lab gives a competitive advantage to companies in China and other countries that send products to the U.S. without meeting the stringent quality standards that come with certification, said Eric Axel, executive director of the American Medical Manufacturers Association.",
      "\u201cThis decision effectively rewards foreign manufacturers who have not made the same investments in quality and safety while punishing American companies that have built their reputations on producing reliable, high-quality protective equipment,\u201d Axel said in a statement.",
      "The cuts are \u201creally devastating,\u201d said Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center, a Kentucky-based organization that provides legal help to ill coal miners.",
      "\u201cHere in central Appalachia, everybody knows somebody with black lung disease,\u201d she said.",
      "It appears NIOSH programs for coal miners are being eliminated, raising questions about who will monitor for new cases and spot trends, Shelton said.",
      "NIOSH staff routinely visited mines and rural communities to offer free screenings and speak at public meetings about black lung disease and other workplace health issues.",
      "\u201cThese are not out-of-touch federal workers. They are very well connected\u201d with their communities, she said.",
      "Many NIOSH workers come from families that have worked in occupational health for generations. Niemeier-Walsh\u2019s grandfather was an agency toxicologist for 30 years.",
      "\u201cIt was normal dinnertime conversation in our family to talk about how you can use the power of science to protect workers,\u201d she said.",

      "Trump singled out several Dodgers for their achievements last season, praising Ohtani for becoming baseball's first 50 home run-50 stolen base player, Japanese pitcher Yoshi Yamamoto and NL Championship Series MVP Tommy Edman.",
      "Trump praised Betts for his play \u2014 and took a dig at the Boston Red Sox for trading him to the Dodgers \u2014 and they shook hands at the ceremony.",
      "Betts, the star outfielder at the time for the 2018 champion Boston Red Sox, did not make that team\u2019s trip to the White House the next year during Trump's first term.

But it is what it is. I\u2019m not trying to make this political by any means at all. All it is is just me being with my team to celebrate something. It\u2019s a privilege to get an invitation like this. I just want to be there with them.\u201d",
      "Manager Dave Roberts had called the invitation a huge honor that each World Series champion gets to experience. Roberts said deciding to go to the White House was not a formal conversation he and players had.",

      "Trump did talk briefly about former New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whom the former New Yorker called a friend. Trump also poked fun at the late Yankees owner's notorious short-leash with his managers after he congratulated Roberts.",
      "\u201cI think he would have lasted even with George Steinbrenner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou lose two games and you're fired.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Mark Walter and pitcher Clayton Kershaw gave brief remarks at the White House. Kershaw presented Trump with a Dodgers jersey and No. 47 on the back.",

      "The conversation around a joint men's and women's Final Four has resurfaced",
      "TAMPA, Fla. -- Millions tuned in to watch women's basketball powerhouses UConn and South Carolina dominate in the Final Four on Friday. Many more watched Houston and Florida stun their opponents in the men's Final Four a day later.",
      "Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman sees a world where both premier events happen in the same place.",
      "It's not a new conversation, but Ackerman believes the exponential growth of women's basketball in a landscape long dominated by the men makes now an ideal time for a joint Final Four.",
      "\u201cYou will get people to say that it shouldn\u2019t happen,\" said Ackerman, who has been commissioner of the Big East since 2013. \u201cThat the women\u2019s tournament is doing just fine. And that\u2019s not without merit. I\u2019m saying if the NCAA is looking for growth \u2014 and it is \u2014 and is looking for revenue growth \u2014 and it is. I can\u2019t think of many ways you could accomplish that in a significant way versus in an incremental way than combining the two Final Fours.\"",
      "The men and women\u2019s basketball tournaments would hold their semifinals and title games in the same city on the same weekend, with similar staggered scheduling as there currently is. Though a combined Final Four likely couldn\u2019t take place until at least 2032, with sites on both sides locked in until 2031.",
      "NCAA President Charlie Baker isn't opposed to the idea, which would have to be approved by a committee of NCAA, but he acknowledged there would be challenges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something they don\u2019t discuss,\" Baker said. \"They do. I think there are two big issues with it. The biggest one is just finding a place that would be able to make that whole thing work. Just logistically (it) would be challenging.\u201d",
      "Combining the tournaments was also recommended several years ago after an external review of gender disparities between the men's and women's tourneys. The scathing report was released in August 2021 by a law firm hired by the NCAA, sparked by social media and player complaints about glaring differences in amenities at the men's and women's sites.",
      "Ackerman said the idea she's been pushing for over 10 years should at least be considered. She wrote a paper for the NCAA in 2013 proposing ideas for more equity in the championships, including combining both Final Fours.",
      "With different sites, many commissioners, athletic directors and school officials find themselves having to choose which tournament to attend, Ackerman said. And because more ancillary events and sponsorship activations happen at the men's site, those officials often end up at that one instead of the women's tournament.",
      "\u201cThere's a symbolism there that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d Ackerman said, \u201cwhich is, we\u2019re trying to build women\u2019s basketball. We need everybody on board to do that. We need the athletic directors here (at the women's tournament). ... We\u2019re losing that sort of spiritual support, if you will, for women\u2019s basketball because it\u2019s head to head with the men\u2019s Final Four, which is a magnet for all the networking and business activity.\u201d",
      "Ed Desser, the sports media executive who co-authored that 2021 gender equity analysis, said it makes financial sense to combine the tournaments, as it creates a central location for everyone, including NCAA staff, to operate from.",
      "\u201cSecondly, you have the opportunity, which may have seemed like a bit of a fantasy a few years back, but nowadays, the notion of filling up a dome to see the women\u2019s finals makes a lot of sense,\u201d Desser said. \u201cAnd that creates operating efficiencies and creates substantial additional revenue opportunities.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas was one of the large metropolitan areas that Ackerman said could work for a combined tournament. The city, which has the WNBA's Aces, the NFL's Raiders and the NHL's Golden Knights, has hosted the NBA Summer League \u2014 with 30 teams \u2014 since its inaugural season in 2004.",
      "There are also concerns that the women could be overshadowed by the men if the tournaments were held in the same place.",
      "John Kosner, a digital media consultant, who co-authored the gender equity report with Desser, said women's basketball's expanding reach should quell those apprehensions.",
      "Last year's women\u2019s NCAA championship game drew a bigger television audience than the men\u2019s title game for the first time, with an average of 18.9 million viewers watching undefeated South Carolina beat Iowa and superstar Caitlin Clark.",
      "This year's tournament has seen a slight decrease in ratings so far, which shouldn't come as a surprise with Clark now in the WNBA. Still, the early rounds were the second-most watched ever, as many tuned in to see big names like Paige Bueckers and UConn gear up for their national championship run.",
      "\u201cThe Women\u2019s Final Four has been incredibly exciting,\u201d said Florida men's basketball coach Todd Golden. \u201cI think it would be pretty neat to be able to bring the fan bases, both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side, together and have an experience like that. There is never too much great basketball that you can have going on at the same place at the same time, especially in the collegiate ranks.\u201d",
      "UConn coach Geno Auriemma and LSU's Kim Mulkey weren't happy with the current Super Regional format for the women's tournament because of what they described as travel inconveniences and an inability for much of their fanbases to get to their games in Spokane, Washington.",
      "It\u2019s the third season that the four women\u2019s regionals have been consolidated into two sites. This year, the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were played in Spokane and Birmingham, Alabama.",
      "The Huskies traveled cross-country from Connecticut to Washington, then flew nearly 3,000 miles back to Tampa for the semifinals the day after their Elite Eight game. Auriemma criticized the format again during the Final Four.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to shortchange\" the players, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to sell them short, you know? ... You shouldn\u2019t be trying to make more money by shortchanging their experience. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody on the guys\u2019 side and the committee is going, \u2018I think we can save a couple dollars if we do this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they worry about that.\u201d",
      "Baker said the goal of the Super Regional was to increase attendance and improve the quality of the experience for the players, which seems to be in line Ackerman's proposal.",
      "\u201cIt worked,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI mean, the attendance is up dramatically over the last three years in the regional rounds as a result of that.\u201d",
      "Baker also estimated the NCAA spent at least $15 million on the women\u2019s tournament over the past few years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure when the tournament\u2019s over, people will sit down,\u201d he said, \"the committee will take all the feedback they got from everybody they heard from and make decisions for the future.\"",

      "\u201cI congratulate you on your outstanding record. You have surpassed legendary masters in the number of goals scored in National Hockey League regular-season games,\u201d Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin on Monday.",
      "Breaking Gretzky\u2019s record \u201chas become not only your personal success, but also a real celebration for fans in Russia and abroad,\u201d Putin added. \u201cI wish you health, good fortune (and) fighting spirit to conquer new heights in life and in sports.\u201d",

      "Alex Ovechkin's pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL goals record became the talk of the league a time of the season usually reserved only for playoff races",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Alex Ovechkin could not contain his happiness moments after scoring his 895th goal to break Wayne Gretzky's NHL record and etch his name into the history books.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d he told teammates in an electric visiting arena with over 17,000 fans locked in on his every move. \"It\u2019s history! Yeah!\u201d",
      "Ovechkin celebrated No. 895 with the same joy he oozed after so many of his first 894, bellyflopping onto the ice like he did into fountains in Washington when he and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018. That was the high-water mark for the franchise earning its first championship, but this stuck out in a different way.",
      "The Cup gets handed out once a year. Ovechkin broke a record that stood for more than three decades, with the chance for his reign to last even longer. At a time of the season in a team-centric sport that is usually reserved only for playoff races, Ovechkin's \u201cGR8 Chase\u201d captivated the hockey community and brought joy not only to the sport but the rest of the world eager to witness something special.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Ovi,\u201d said center Dylan Strome, who along with Tom Wilson had the assists on Ovechkin's record-breaker Sunday in a 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders. \u201cEveryone wants to see him succeed because he\u2019s such a happy guy. It doesn\u2019t matter if he scores a goal or someone else scores a goal: He\u2019s just as happy. And I think that\u2019s a credit to him and his character, and you could see why other people are so happy for him because of the way he treats other people.\u201d",
      "The charismatic Russian superstar has made a career out of scoring like no one else and commemorating the moment even better. Whether it was jumping into the glass or mimicking that his stick was on fire, Ovechkin became one of the faces of the game for how he always acted like a little kid playing a grown-up sport.",
      "\"You just smile every time you see it,\" coach Spencer Carbery said, echoing Strome about Ovechkin being just as happy to see his teammates score. \u201cIt speaks to him, but also who he is as a captain and as a leader, of the happiness and joy that he has to win and to see others have success and others to score goals, as well.\u201d",
      "No team or goaltender wanted to be the one to give up No. 895, but the Islanders \u2014 and netminder Ilya Sorokin, specifically, giving Ovechkin his stick when asked \u2014 still had full appreciation of the moment they were a part of.",
      "\u201cNo matter what team you were cheering for tonight, everyone was a hockey fan,\" Islanders captain Anders Lee said. \u201cEveryone on our side and their side can appreciate Ovi's accomplishment.\"",
      "The run-up to the accomplishment was half the fun. Goal-counters from Washington to Moscow tracked the quest. Ticket prices surged and subsided based on how close Ovechkin was to catching and passing Gretzky.",
      "If the pressure was mounting on Ovechkin at 39 in the twilight of his career, he sure didn't show it. And the Capitals made it their life's work to get him the record.",
      "It finally came midway through the 77th game out of 82, bringing relief to everyone involved.",
      "\u201cOver the last couple of weeks, it has now turned into he\u2019s right there,\u201d Carbery said. \u201cAnd for us, especially as coaches, we go to the hundreds and hundreds of hours that we\u2019ve been trying to figure out ways to get him the next goal. (When) you\u2019ve been working 80-hour weeks for the last two years to try to help get the next goal, it\u2019s a pretty special moment for us to celebrate.\u201d",
      "The NHL and the Capitals put together a video montage of greats from Simone Biles and Michael Phelps to Tom Brady, LeBron James and Derek Jeter to congratulate Ovechkin. In that moment, it was clear this accomplishment transcended hockey \u2014 and even sports.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great for the game,\u201d Ovechkin said. \"It\u2019s great for us to be involved for this moment. ... Right now, people celebrate, people are happy and I\u2019m just happy to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Longtime teammate John Carlson, who assisted on the tying 894th goal on Friday night in the first half of a wild weekend party, said he and the Capitals \u201cwere just along for the ride.\u201d So was everyone else watching, and Ovechkin provided a ride of a lifetime.",

      "Now, with Clark and Reese in the WNBA, Bueckers headed to the league and Watkins sidelined for the foreseeable future with an ACL injury, it raises the question of who will pick up the torch and continue that momentum.",
      "There may be no clear candidate to become the face of the game, though there's no shortage of talented players, including UCLA\u2019s Lauren Betts, UConn freshman Sarah Strong and South Carolina freshman Joyce Edwards. And there are more looming on the horizon, like high school sensation Aaliyah Chavez will be making her collegiate debut at Oklahoma next season.",
      "The ratings for the women's NCAA Tournament leading into the title game Sunday didn\u2019t match last year\u2019s record numbers, though they were better than nearly every other year in NCAA history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great sign that without Caitlin we\u2019re still certainly on the ascent,\u201d ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. \u201cHopefully, that\u2019s the same even without the star power next year of Paige Bueckers and JuJu. The game is at place where it can still grow.\u201d",
      "The talent pool continues to get stronger, as was evident in the title game performances by Strong (24 points and 15 rebounds) and Edwards (10 points, five rebounds). As expected, both impacted the game though UConn came away with its 12th national championship, ending a nine-year drought with an 82-59 victory over South Carolina.",
      "\u201cRuns like this make you still feel relevant, you still have an impact. Kids still respond,\u201d Huskies coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cOur coaching staff is really, really good at what they do. And I\u2019m fortunate enough to coach great kids who want to win for each other.\u201d",
      "Even though UConn was back on top at the end, more teams showed this season they could compete with the best. UCLA, which held the No. 1 spot in the AP poll for 14 weeks, had no seniors on its team and coming off its first NCAA Final Four ever, could go a step further next season.",
      "South Carolina will be back too with a young nucleus led by Edwards and MiLaysia Fulwiley.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for what our team will look like next year,\u201d South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. \u201cI am, because I do think they\u2019ll be talented enough to get here, especially with getting in the transfer portal and getting some experienced pieces that can help with this young group.\u201d",
      "Women's basketball, like other college sports, has changed the last few years with the transfer portal. There are over 1,200 players currently in the portal, a person with access to it shared with The Associated Press.",
      "Where some of those impact players \u2014 Olivia Miles, Cotie McMahon and Ta'Niya Latson \u2014 end up could not only shape which teams rise up to challenge UConn and South Carolina next season, but also which player separates herself from the rest.",

      "Photos on social media showed a goose nesting in a juniper planter next to the center-field seats underneath the scoreboard during Saturday\u2019s game. Several rows of the upper bleachers were blocked off from fans Sunday while two Canada geese stood on a roof nearby. Fans snapped photos of the feathered duo before Sunday\u2019s game began.",
      "\u201cAt the Friendly Confines, we truly mean it when we say everyone\u2019s welcome, including the goose and her nest who took up residence in the bleachers,\u201d Cubs Senior Director of Communications Jennifer Martinez said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re giving her the space she needs while we\u2019ve been working closely with a wildlife organization to manage the situation safely and responsibly, in full accordance with state law. In the meantime, we have blocked off the area to fans. Protecting our fans, and our feathered guest, is our top priority.\u201d",
      "One goose appeared to be sitting on the nest a couple of hours before first pitch but took off flying with its mate.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the best view of the game,\u201d said Michael Pardun, 26, of Chicago, who attended the game with friends in the bleachers. \u201cThey\u2019re diehard fans.\"",
      "Season-ticket holders Debbie Hultine, 69, and Buster Zenor, 71, of Spring Valley, Illinois, moved from their usual seats in the bleachers to accommodate the geese. They saw the female goose nesting during the Cubs\u2019 home opener Friday and again Saturday. They said they thought the geese chose the bushy area when the ballpark was quiet before the Cubs played their first home game, a 3-1 victory over the Padres.",
      "\u201cShe was pretty calm for 42,000-plus people,\u201d Hultine said of the female goose.",
      "The geese became agitated when fans banged on a nearby wall during Friday\u2019s game, Hultine said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both keeping an eye on things,\u201d Hultine said. \u201cThe male will keep sentry for a while. Opening day, he was above the press box sitting up by one of the flags. When she got a little upset when guys were banging, she honked and he did come back and he was up there for a very short time with his wings out and he was hissing.\u201d",
      "Hultine has been attending games for more than 60 years, and she and Zenor were married at Wrigley. She said this is the first time she has seen a goose nest in the ballpark.",

    "story": [
      "Alex Ovechkin has broken Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record for the most goals in NHL history by scoring the 895th of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Alex Ovechkin has broken Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record for the most goals in NHL history by scoring the 895th of his career.",
      "The Washington Capitals\u2019 captain made history Sunday against the New York Islanders by beating fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin on a power play with 12:34 left in the second period. He took a perfect pass from longtime teammate Tom Wilson and fired an absolute laser past Sorokin with defenseman Jakob Chychrun screening.",
      "Ovechkin had never scored on Sorokin before, making his countryman the 183rd different goaltender he has beaten. He dived onto the ice to celebrate as so many Capitals fans in attendance chanted \u201cOvi! Ovi!\u201d from the stands.",
      "Just as they did after he scored No. 894, teammates mobbed the 39-year-old Ovechkin to celebrate the accomplishment, which replaced a record that had stood for 31 years. Ovechkin then hugged team equipment and training staff on the bench and went through a handshake line with the Islanders as crew members set up for the 895 ceremony.",
      "Gretzky\u2019s total of 894 goals had long seemed unapproachable. Ovechkin passed it even after missing 16 games in November and December because of a broken left leg, a testament to his durability and a knack for putting the puck in the net consistently for two decades. He surpassed 40 goals this season for a 14th time \u2014 two more than Gretzky and also the most in league history.",
      "Even before this, Ovechkin owned the NHL records for power-play goals, shots on goal and the most goalies scored against, now adding Sorokin to that list. Only Gretzky has more multi-goal games, and Ovechkin earlier this season became just the sixth player with 700 goals and 700 assists, joining Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Jaromir Jagr, Marcel Dionne and Phil Esposito.",
      "Ovechkin last moved up the all-time goal-scoring list Dec. 23, 2022, when he got Nos. 801 and 802 to tie and pass Howe.",
      "The chase by the Great 8, a nickname honoring his jersey number, captured attention from North America to Ovechkin\u2019s native Russia, where billboards and goal-counters cheered on and tracked his effort. It helped Ovechkin that his team is one of the best in the NHL this season, defying expectations.",
      "Gretzky broke Howe\u2019s record a little over 31 years ago, since he scored 802 on March 23, 1994. He added 92 more before retiring in 1999 after a total of 1,487 games over 20 seasons.",
      "Even with this one falling to Ovechkin \u2014 which he has said he is excited about \u2014 Gretzky holds 55 NHL records, and two seem truly untouchable: 2,857 total points and 1,963 assists, the latter of which is more than anyone else has in goals and assists combined.",
      "For NHL playoff goals, which do not count toward the record, Gretzky has the most (122). Ovechkin has 72. Gretzky also had another 56 in the World Hockey Association regular season and playoffs, while Ovechkin has 57 from his time in the KHL, Russia\u2019s top league.",
      "Returning to Russia to play in front of family and friends is an option at some point for Ovechkin, who has one season left after this one on the five-year, $47.5 million contract he signed in 2021, which took him through age 40 to give him enough time to chase Gretzky\u2019s record. Instead, he got it done earlier than just about anyone could have realistically expected.",

      "The Milwaukee Brewers placed left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list with a flexor strain in his left elbow, further depleting the team\u2019s starting pitching",
      "MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Brewers placed left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list Sunday with a flexor strain in his left elbow, further depleting the team's starting pitching.",
      "The loss of Cortes leaves the Brewers with Freddy Peralta as the only healthy pitcher among those projected to be in the five-man rotation this season.",
      "Cortes' elbow problem surfaced last weekend following a rough outing that saw him give up three home runs on consecutive pitches and five overall in a 20-9 loss to the New York Yankees. Imaging tests revealed no structural damage, and Cortes threw six shutout innings against the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night.",
      "\u201cLeading up to the game it wasn\u2019t feeling great but it felt good enough to pitch and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cAfter that is when I started feeling more sore than usual.\u201d",
      "Cortes said the elbow didn't feel right on Friday, and on Saturday he and the team agreed he needed to go on the injured list. Left-handed reliever Grant Wolfram was recalled from Triple-A Nashville.",
      "The Brewers said further testing would be done on Cortes' elbow.",
      "\u201cThis is not a situation that we think is going to be a long-term issue,\u201d assistant general manager Matt Kleine said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the process of gathering information -- that\u2019ll take another few days -- but as of right now, this is looking more like a short-term issue than a long-term issue.\u201d",
      "Cortes has dealt with the injury before. He missed a month last season and, despite not being fully recovered, he returned to pitch for the Yankees in the World Series. Cortes said the reward of pitching in the World Series outweighed the risk of a potential long-term injury.",
      "\u201cIf I have a ring and then a year off of baseball, then so be it,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "Cortes didn\u2019t get the ring. He gave up a walk-off grand slam to Freddie Freeman in Game 1 and the Yankees lost in five games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. A few weeks later he was traded to Milwaukee in a deal that sent All-Star closer Devin Williams to New York.",
      "The Brewers were confident Cortes would be ready when spring training opened, and their medical staff devised a plan to build him up carefully for the regular season.",
      "\u201cBetween me and the medical staff, we\u2019ve had good communication,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cOnce I got traded, I got an MRI in the offseason and then going through the whole rehab process in the offseason gave us a better idea of where I stood with the arm.",
      "\u201cWe did a really good job in spring training so it sucks that we\u2019re here right now.\u201d",
      "Cortes is the eighth Brewers pitcher, and seventh starter, to land on the injured list.",
      "Milwaukee went into camp knowing they\u2019d be without Brandon Woodruff until at least May while he works his way back from shoulder surgery in September 2023. Robert Gasser was out, too, after undergoing Tommy John surgery last summer.",
      "DL Hall suffered a lat injury just before camp opened, and Aaron Ashby and Tobias Myers were lost to oblique injuries. Aaron Civale got in one start before he landed on the IL with a hamstring strain.",
      "To shore up depth, the Brewers signed veteran left-hander Jose Quintana in mid-March but he\u2019s yet to make a start. He has remained in Arizona to continue building up strength after his late arrival.",

      "The National Weather Service is no longer providing translations of its products after its contract with an artificial intelligence company was allowed to lapse",
      "The National Weather Service is no longer providing language translations of its products, a change that experts say could put non-English speakers at risk of missing potentially life-saving warnings about extreme weather.",
      "The weather service has \u201cpaused\u201d the translations because its contract with Lilt, an artificial intelligence company, has lapsed, NWS spokesman Michael Musher said. He declined further comment.",
      "Lilt, an artificial intelligence company, began providing translations in late 2023, replacing manual translations that the weather service had said were labor-intensive and not sustainable and eventually. It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan. The contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.",
      "NOAA referred questions about the contract to a message on its website announcing the contract had lapsed. Lilt did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Nearly 68 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English at home, including 42 million Spanish speakers, according to 2019 Census data.",
      "Not being able to read urgent weather alerts could be a matter of life or death, said Joseph Trujillo-Falc\u00f3n, a researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who has worked with NOAA researching how to translate weather and climate information to the public, including the use of artificial intelligence.",
      "He said translated weather alerts saved lives during a deadly tornado outbreak in Kentucky in 2021. A Spanish-speaking family interviewed afterward said they got a tornado alert on their cellphone in English but ignored it because they didn't understand it, he said. When the same alert came in Spanish, they quickly sought shelter, he said.",
      "\u201cIt saved their life,\u201d said Trujillo-Falc\u00f3n.",
      "Trujillo-Falc\u00f3n said weather alerts used to be translated by forecasters that spoke more than one language, a task that could be \u201ccompletely overwhelming\u201d on top of their forecasting duties.",
      "The translations are important for more than extreme weather events, said Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia Climate School at Columbia University. General weather forecasts are essential for a number of sectors including tourism, transportation and energy. Families and businesses can make more informed decisions when they can get weather information that often includes actions that should be taken based on the forecast.",
      "Norma Mendoza-Denton, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there are many people in the U.S. that function with limited English relevant to their daily routines. For example, a shopkeeper might be able to have short conversations with customers, but might not have the same understanding when it comes to reading weather or climate terminologies.",
      "\u201cIf they don\u2019t have access to that National Weather Service information in the different languages, that could be the difference between life and death for somebody,\u201d said Mendoza-Denton.",

      "An investigation by The Associated Press revealed earlier this year that AI models from Microsoft and OpenAI had been used as part of an Israeli military program to select bombing targets during the recent wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

      "Even as he grows older, Microsoft founder Bill Gates still fondly remembers the catalytic computer code he wrote 50 years ago that opened up a new frontier in technology.",
      "Although the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what's powering today's artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.",
      "Gates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world's first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.",
      "The article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair's maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company's CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn't yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.",
      "Gates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn't even have a prototype of the machine.",
      "After spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair's first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.",
      "The code would go on to provide the foundation for a business that would make personal computers a household staple, with a suite of software that include the Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, as well as the Windows operating system that still powers most PCs today.",
      "\u201cThat was the revolution,\u201d Gates said of the code in a video accompanying his post. \u201cThat was the thing that ushered in personal computing.\u201d",
      "Gates' recollection of the code is part of a nostalgic kick that he has been on this year as he prepares to turn 70 in October.",
      "The trip down memory lane included the February release of a memoir exploring his early years as an often-misunderstood child with few friends, and a hailing of the 25th anniversary of the philanthropic foundation he created after stepping down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000. The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates' departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.",
      "In his memoir, Gates also reflected on his tempestuous relationship with fellow PC pioneer, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose company will be celebrating its golden anniversary next year.",
      "\u201cFifty years is a long time,\u201d said Gates, whose personal fortune is estimated at $108 billion. \u201cIt's crazy that the dream came true.\u201d",

      "Construction crews in Vienna last year made an unprecedented discovery",
      "VIENNA -- As construction crews churned up dirt to renovate a Vienna soccer field last October, they happened upon an unprecedented find: A heap of intertwined skeletal remains in a mass grave dating to the 1st-century Roman Empire, likely the bodies of warriors in a battle involving Germanic tribes.",
      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",
      "The pit where the bodies were deposited suggests a hasty or disorganized dumping of corpses. Every skeleton examined showed signs of injury \u2014 to the head, torso and pelvis in particular.",
      "\u201cThey have various different battle wounds, which rules out execution. It is truly a battlefield,\" said Kristina Adler-W\u00f6lfl, head of Vienna city archaeological department. \u201cThere are wounds from swords, lances; wounds from blunt trauma.\u201d",
      "The victims were all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health.",
      "Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave \u2013 armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.",

      "What was once Pennsylvania\u2019s biggest coal-fired power plant is being turned into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus designed to capitalize on Big Tech's fast-growing energy demands",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The owners of what was once Pennsylvania's biggest coal-fired power plant said Wednesday that they will turn it into a $10 billion natural gas-powered data center campus designed to capitalize on the fast-growing energy demands of Big Tech companies to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing applications.",
      "The former Homer City Generating Station, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Pittsburgh, will host seven gas-fired turbines to power data centers on site with up to 4.5 gigawatts of electricity, according to the owners, an investor group named Homer City Development.",
      "That amount of electricity is enough to power about 3 million homes.",
      "Construction is expected to begin this year and power could start flowing by 2027, the group said in a statement. The cost to prepare the site and build the data centers could exceed the initial $10 billion investment by billions more, the group said.",
      "Much of the critical infrastructure for the project is already in place from the shuttered Homer City power plant, including transmission lines connected to the mid-Atlantic and New York power grids, substations and water access, the group said.",
      "The developers were awarded a $5 million state grant to extend a gas line to the property, which sits atop the prolific Marcellus Shale natural gas reservoir.",
      "Last month, the group demolished the three cooling towers and four smokestacks still standing from the former coal plant. It shut down in 2023 after 54 years in operation.",
      "The owners, Homer City Development, blamed competition with cheaper natural gas, unseasonably warm winters that demanded less power, the rising cost of coal and increasingly expensive environmental regulations.",
      "The late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 built with help from Microsoft's data centers \u2014 ignited worldwide demand for chatbots and other generative AI products that typically require large amounts of computing power to train and operate.",
      "That has sent Big Tech companies in search of new power sources, spurred interest in a new wave of nuclear reactors, revived interest in building new gas-fired plants and stoked concerns among states and federal regulators about electricity shortages.",
      "It's also prompted utilities to delay the retirements of aging power plants and to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, including last year's announcement that the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant will reopen under a 20-year agreement to feed Microsoft's data centers.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits, but one related to TikTok barely generates a peep",
      "WASHINGTON -- After TikTok was banned in the United States earlier this year, President Donald Trump gave the platform a reprieve, barreling past a law that was passed in Congress and upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court that said the ban was necessary for national security.",
      "The Republican president's executive orders have spurred more than 130 lawsuits in the little more than two months he has been in office, but this one barely generated a peep. None of those suits challenges his temporary block of the 2024 law that banned the popular social video app after the deadline passed for it to be sold by ByteDance, its China-based parent company.",
      "Few of the 431 members of the House of Representatives and the Senate who voted for the law have complained.",
      "Despite a bipartisan consensus about the risk to national security posed by TikTok\u2019s ties to China, \"it\u2019s as if nothing ever happened,\u201d said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "TikTok continues to function, much to the delight of its 170 million users in the U.S., and the tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle have been persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Trump declared he was suspending the law for 75 days, though no provision of the rule would appear to allow for that, to give ByteDance a fresh chance to find a U.S. buyer. The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.",
      "Trump's action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump's inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.",
      "The court's opinions dealt at length with the potential for China to harvest vast quantities of TikTok users' data that could allow it to track the locations of federal employees and contractors.",
      "\u201cThe record before us establishes that TikTok mines data both from TikTok users and about millions of others who do not consent to share their information,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a brief separate opinion. \u201cAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TikTok can access \u2018any data\u2019 stored in a consenting user\u2019s \u2018contact list\u2019 \u2014 including names, photos, and other personal information about unconsenting third parties.\u201d",
      "TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China\u2019s government has never and will not ask companies to \u201ccollect or provide data, information or intelligence\u201d held in foreign countries.",
      "The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "The president's position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.",
      "Trump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would \u201csave TikTok,\u201d then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.",
      "The law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.",
      "Trump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe law does not permit the sort of \u2018extension\u2019 that Donald Trump has announced,\" Rozenshtein said.",
      "But both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they\u2019re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,\u201d Kreps said.",
      "It also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.",
      "More importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early \"example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "While Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.",
      "Companies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok's operations since the law's effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.",
      "The companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump's order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but \u201cApple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.\"",
      "The companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.",
      "The Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.",
      "Among the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIf ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.",
      "Several potential bidders have stepped forward.",
      "Perplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Another possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, had also organized a consortium, which included the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and offered ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",

    "story": [
      "He says they're both a 'national emergency' response and a negotiating tactic.",
      "Amid mixed messaging from top White House officials, President Donald Trump was asked directly on Monday whether his sweeping tariffs are negotiable or here to stay.",
      "\"They can both be true,\" Trump responded. \"There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs.\"",
      "For days, from Trump on down, administration officials have offered conflicting statements on whether countries can do anything to save themselves from the tariffs, which include a universal 10% tariff implemented over the weekend and what they claimed were more targeted \"reciprocal\" tariffs to take effect on Wednesday.",
      "On Monday alone, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent shared he was tasked with negotiating with Japan while White House trade advisor Peter Navarro penned an editorial that the new policies are \"not a negotiation.\"",
      "Bessent posted on social media that following a \"very constructive phone discussion\" with Japanese officials, Trump instructed him and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to \"open negotiations to implement the President's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.\"",
      "Navarro wrote in the Financial Times that Trump wouldn't be backing down from his \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nations the administration's deemed the worst offenders in trade relations.",
      "\"This is about fairness, and no one can argue with that. This is not a negotiation,\" Navarro wrote. \"For the US, it is a national emergency triggered by trade deficits caused by a rigged system. President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs -- know this: that's just the beginning.\"",
      "When Trump announced the sweeping tariffs in the White House Rose Garden, he justified them as a response to a \"national emergency\" caused by trade deficits and unfair practices with global partners.",
      "Since then, markets at home and abroad slumped. Foreign leaders recoiled, with some -- like China -- taking retaliatory action against the United States. Economists increased their odds of a recession this year.",
      "Officials were pressed to justify the action on Sunday morning news shows, where again the confused messaging was apparent. Trump spent the weekend golfing as fallout from his tariff policy continued.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, on the CBS News program \"Face the Nation,\" said tariffs were going to \"stay in place for days and weeks\" and that \"this is the policy.\"",
      "Meanwhile, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, on ABC News' \"This Week,\" boasted that 50 countries had reached out to the White House to negotiate tariffs.",
      "Trump on Monday said they're open to \"fair deals\" with foreign leaders that put \"America first\" -- but that tariffs would stay in place in the meantime.",
      "\"We're going to get fair deals and good deals with every country. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them. They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,\" he said.",
      "ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce asked Trump on Monday if he'd be open to a pause in tariffs to allow for negotiation.",
      "\"Well, we're not looking at that,\" Trump responded. \"We have many, many, countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals. And in certain cases, they're going to be paying substantial tariffs.\"",
      "A rumor of a possible 90-day tariff pause that circulated on Monday caused stocks to briefly spike into green territory before going back into the red when the White House denied the report.",
      "Trump said in the Oval Office that he doesn't \"mind going through it,\" seemingly a nod to the criticism and volatility of the market because he believes it's worth it at the end of the day.",
      "\"So, it's got to be very interesting,\" he said. \"It's the only chance our country will have to reset the table because no other president would be willing to do what I'm doing or to even go through it. Now, I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end.\"",

      "Officials say the Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Monday, rushing to implement President Donald Trump's order that troops be rehired and given back pay.",
      "Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The soldiers have signed their contracts and were sworn in, and the active duty troops were reporting to their units, the Army said.",
      "None of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites on Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they are sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged.",
      "Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said the vaccine mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d",
      "Those who may have been attracted by the offer of back pay will likely get far less money than they initially thought when Trump announced his plan. Under the details of the Pentagon offer, any wages earned during their time as civilians would be deducted from the back pay total, along with other payments they may have received.",
      "The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force. The Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023.",
      "The initial reenlistments come as the Pentagon last week formally increased the new minimum service commitment from two to four years for those discharged for refusing a lawful order to take the vaccine.",
      "A Feb. 7 memo sent to the secretaries of the military services said troops would be required to sign up for two years. But a memo signed April 1 by Jules Hurst III, who is doing the job of defense undersecretary for personnel, said \u201creinstatement will not be afforded to those who are unwilling or unable to return to active service or active status, as applicable, for four years.\u201d",
      "The Army said the bulk of the soldiers who reenlisted were those ordered out for refusing the shot, and they signed on for four years. They will be entitled to get some back pay. Several, however, left the Army voluntarily to avoid the shot, so they are allowed to reenlist for two years and will not get back pay.",
      "According to the new memo, there is an exception for anyone who would have been eligible for retirement within two years of the date they were originally discharged. Those service members also can reenlist for at least two years.",
      "Roughly 8,200 troops were discharged for refusing to obey the vaccine order. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, but that did not include any back pay. Just 113 reenlisted.",
      "The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members for several weeks. The Navy and the Air Force had been waiting for the additional guidance.",
      "According to Army spokesman Christopher Surridge, about 400 soldiers have inquired so far about the reenlistment program. Of those, about 100 are in the application process. The Army did not have estimates on how much it has given the soldiers in total back pay.",
      "As of Friday, 472 Marines have indicated interest in learning more about returning. The Navy said about a half dozen sailors had so far expressed interest or sought more information, and the Air Force said it had not yet gotten any feedback from service members.",
      "The limited interest reflects what service leaders said early on, which was that many troops used the vaccine as a reason to leave and have moved on with their lives.",
      "Those eligible for back pay could get an amount that includes their basic salary, bonus payments, cost-of-living allowances and some health benefit costs. But that total will be reduced by any wages, veterans benefits, separation payments, debts and other amounts that were earned during that time.",
      "Service members will have to provide verified tax records and other paperwork as part of the process.",
      "According to the memo, the services must provide each person with an estimate of the amount of back pay they will receive. Service members will then have 60 days to decide whether to reenlist.",
      "Everyone who wants to reenlist must meet all military standards, including health, fitness and moral requirements. Service members have until Feb. 28, 2026, to seek reinstatement.",

      "According to his LinkedIn page, DeLorenz departed Cannon's office in August 2024, just a month after Cannon tossed out the case against Trump, in which she bucked decades of legal precedent by finding that Smith had been unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "It's unclear whether Blanche, who was Trump's lead attorney in the classified documents case and took office early last month following a narrow confirmation by the U.S. Senate, had any direct involvement in DeLorenz's hiring.",

      "While clerking for a district judge is often a path to a senior job in an administration, DeLorenz's position is the first known appointment to the DOJ of a former clerk for Judge Cannon, whose dismissal of the documents case handed Trump a massive political victory.",

We partly laid this pathway for this demagogue to come into office, and so the way we deal with that, the way we correct from those mistakes, is to do more of the centering of American voices, American people in our conversation and in our focus, not focus on politics, focus on people.\u201d",
      "Booker\u2019s marathon 25 hour and 4 minute speech that concluded Tuesday evening broke the record for the longest speech on the Senate floor.

I confess we all must look in the mirror and say 'we will do better.'\"",
      "Booker told Stephanopoulos the action he tried to inspire with his speech should not be confused with partisan politics.",
      "\u201cThis is not about the Democratic Party, I'm sorry,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThe Democratic Party is at its weakest when it's concerned about the party.

      "Booker: God bless Kevin, but I've never seen an administration in my lifetime do something so monumentally wrong and that so staggeringly hurts American people. I've been hearing all day yesterday, from frightened Americans who've saved for their entire lives, for retirement in the coming months, but now know they can't because in one fell swoop, Donald Trump has devastated their retirement accounts, their 401(k)s\u2026 This president is pushing, yet again, a plan to gut basic services to give bigger and bigger tax cuts to the wealthy. So the chaos he has unleashed on America, the financial insecurity that he has brought to people's lives, this is not what he promised people, and I think he will already go down for a president having the worst first 100 days in the last century of any president that's ever taken that office.",

      "Stephanopoulos: \u201cYou also saw Jon Karl's piece about the president\u2019s retribution campaign, he promised to be the retribution during the campaign. We're seeing these moves against universities. We\u2019re seeing these moves against law firms. You took the Senate floor to protest. What should these law firms and universities do?",
      "Booker: \u201cWell, first and foremost, you're calling retribution, but it's something far worse than that. If you look around the world, from Viktor Orban to Vladimir Putin, this is not what democratic leaders do. This is really a violation of our constitutional principles, that he's using that power of that office, not to advance noble causes that could help the American people, whether I disagree with them or not, that's what a president is called to do, do what they think is in the best interests of the public at large. What this president is instead doing is violating our constitutional principles, violating the fundamental rights of people in order to punish them, to carry out his own retribution plan. You know, John F. Kennedy famously said, \u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\u201d Donald Trump is now saying, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump to make amends. He is trying to hurt people, to make them cower to him and offer him tribute in order to not violate the Constitution and hurt them economically.

      "Speaker Mike Johnson and Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna say they have cut a deal to end the fight over proxy voting for new parents, which would reopen the House floor after nearly a week of legislative paralysis.",
      "But a key Democrat who joined with Luna to press to make proxy voting available on Monday criticized the GOP-brokered deal as inadequate.",
      "House Republican leaders agree to formalize \"vote pairing,\" a procedure that would allow a member who is absent during a vote to coordinate with a present member on the other side of the matter to offset the absence, multiple sources familiar with the deal told ABC News.",
      "For example, the procedure in this case would allow a new mother, who is absent for a House vote, to team up with a present lawmaker voting opposite from their stance to form a \"pair.\"",
      "Some logistics of this deal remain unclear including how this will be enforced.",
      "Vote pairing -- a rare practice in Congress -- is certainly not an equivalent to remote voting but allows for an absence to be offset. But the absent member's vote is not recorded into the tally of a recorded vote.",
      "The vote pairing process was used in 2018 when the Senate voted to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. At the time, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said she would vote against Kavanaugh, paired her vote with Sen. Steve Daines' of Montana so their votes would cancel out.",
      "Johnson laid out the specifics of the agreement on a GOP member conference call Sunday afternoon, sources said.",
      "In light of the deal, sources said Luna will not trigger her bipartisan discharge petition -- which has 218 signatures --\u00a0to allow mothers and fathers to vote remotely for up to 12 weeks after childbirth.",
      "\"Speaker Johnson and I have reached an agreement and are formalizing a procedure called 'live/dead pairing'\u2014dating back to the 1800s\u2014for the entire conference to use when unable to physically be present to vote: new parents, bereaved, emergencies,\" Rep. Luna posted in a statement on X.",
      "Luna thanked President Donald Trump for his \"support\" of new mothers. \"If we truly want a pro-family Congress, these are the changes that need to happen,\" she added.",
      "It is possible for other members -- including any Democrat who signed the petition -- to call up and force action on Luna's measure. But it would likely fail if Republicans stick to the vote pairing agreement.",
      "Johnson is still looking at ways to increase accessibility for new mothers in Congress like adding a room off the House floor for nursing mothers, sources said.",
      "House Democrats, meanwhile, who locked arms with Luna last week, on Monday criticized the agreement Republicans reached -- maintaining that it \"fails to provide real solutions\" for lawmakers who are new parents.",
      "Rep. Brittany Pettersen said she is \"grateful\" to Luna for championing the issue that matters \"but the reality is -- this outcome does not address the barriers we've fought so hard to overcome.\"",
      "The blowback likely signals an uphill climb for Luna and Republicans to identify Democrats to offset a GOP absence -- creating an impractical path forward for lawmakers under the \"pairing\" scheme.",
      "\"Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don't have a voice,\" Pettersen, D-Colo., wrote in a statement Monday afternoon. \"Let's be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.\"",
      "Pettersen says the fight is \"far from over,\" while Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., agreed that the deal \"falls short\" of their goal -- though she also pledged to \"keep pushing.\"",
      "\"I won't accept the way Congress has always done things, and the American people won't either,\" Jacobs stated. \"We will keep pushing for innovative ways to support young people and parents in Congress \u2013 including by modernizing how we vote \u2013 even if it takes a Democratic majority to do so.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also refused to endorse the pairing gambit -- signaling he'd take first take the temperature of his caucus members who have led the discussion before publicly commenting.",

      "Sources say a lawsuit calling them unconstitutional could come this week.",
      "A group of business groups and conservative lawyers are preparing a legal challenge to President Donald Trump's tariffs, arguing he does not have the legal authority to impose them.",
      "Sources familiar with the effort say they are preparing to file the challenge in the coming weeks, possibly as soon as this Friday.",
      "One prominent legal figure close to Trump told ABC News there is \"a very good chance\" the U.S. Supreme Court would find Trump's tariffs unconstitutional.",
      "The issue is this: Congress, not the president, has the power to impose taxes and regulate trade. In imposing these tariffs, President Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the the president power to regulate international commerce in the event of a national emergency.",
      "But the IEEPA -- which specifically cites the power to impose sanctions and seize foreign assets -- does not mention tariffs. And, even if one argues the right to impose tariffs is implied, it's not clear what \"national emergency\" could justify the imposition of global tariffs.",
      "\"There is a strong argument that the tariffs imposed under the IEEPA are not legal or constitutional,\" a prominent conservative lawyer close to President Trump told ABC News. \"Under that particular statute, tariffs are not listed amongst the various actions a president can take in response to the declaration of a nation emergency.\"",
      "The lawyer adds: \"And when you combine that with the fact that Article 1, Section 8 [of the Constitution] clearly gives Congress the power to impose duties -- tariffs -- I think those two things in combination raise a very, very serious legal question.\"",
      "Another conservative lawyer familiar with the expected legal challenge to Trump's tariffs predicted the Supreme Court would rule 9-0 against the administration if it reaches the high court.",
      "A lawsuit has already been filed against the 20% sanctions Trump imposed on China earlier this year. The White House cited the IEEPA in imposing those tariffs as well, and the president said they were in response to China's failure to stop the flow of fentanyl into the United States.",
      "The suit was filed in a federal court in Florida last week by The New Civil Liberties Alliance, a conservative legal, on behalf of a Florida-based paper company called Simplified.",
      "Trump's tariffs are the first time a president has attempted to impose global tariffs by citing the IEEPA. The steel and aluminum tariffs Trump imposed on China during his first term where narrower and done under a different congressional authorization. But that act doesn\u2019t specifically give the president the authority to impose tariffs -- and it\u2019s not clear what the emergency is that would justify his actions under the law.",
      "Tariffs have never previously been imposed under the emergency power Trump is using here. The tariffs he imposed in his first term (and President Joe Biden's tariffs, too) were imposed citing different congressional authorizations.",

So this is just an ongoing history of the attacks on those marginalized and vulnerable groups,\" she said.",

      "At an impromptu appearance at a news conference held by Democrats outside the department's headquarters earlier this week, McMahon defended the administration's moves, saying she believes the best education is \"closest to the child where teachers and parents, local superintendents, working together and local school boards to develop the curriculum for those students is the best way that it can happen.\"",
      "McMahon has also vowed\u00a0to continue funding statutorily mandated functions and responsibilities of the department.",

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., launched a \"Save Our Schools\" campaign this week against the administration's attempt to dismantle the department. Her campaign includes investigations, oversight, community engagement and lawsuits, according to the senator.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "Officials say the Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Monday, rushing to implement President Donald Trump's order that troops be rehired and given back pay.",
      "Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The soldiers have signed their contracts and were sworn in, and the active duty troops were reporting to their units, the Army said.",
      "None of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites on Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they are sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged.",
      "Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said the vaccine mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d",
      "Those who may have been attracted by the offer of back pay will likely get far less money than they initially thought when Trump announced his plan. Under the details of the Pentagon offer, any wages earned during their time as civilians would be deducted from the back pay total, along with other payments they may have received.",
      "The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force. The Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023.",
      "The initial reenlistments come as the Pentagon last week formally increased the new minimum service commitment from two to four years for those discharged for refusing a lawful order to take the vaccine.",
      "A Feb. 7 memo sent to the secretaries of the military services said troops would be required to sign up for two years. But a memo signed April 1 by Jules Hurst III, who is doing the job of defense undersecretary for personnel, said \u201creinstatement will not be afforded to those who are unwilling or unable to return to active service or active status, as applicable, for four years.\u201d",
      "The Army said the bulk of the soldiers who reenlisted were those ordered out for refusing the shot, and they signed on for four years. They will be entitled to get some back pay. Several, however, left the Army voluntarily to avoid the shot, so they are allowed to reenlist for two years and will not get back pay.",
      "According to the new memo, there is an exception for anyone who would have been eligible for retirement within two years of the date they were originally discharged. Those service members also can reenlist for at least two years.",
      "Roughly 8,200 troops were discharged for refusing to obey the vaccine order. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, but that did not include any back pay. Just 113 reenlisted.",
      "The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members for several weeks. The Navy and the Air Force had been waiting for the additional guidance.",
      "According to Army spokesman Christopher Surridge, about 400 soldiers have inquired so far about the reenlistment program. Of those, about 100 are in the application process. The Army did not have estimates on how much it has given the soldiers in total back pay.",
      "As of Friday, 472 Marines have indicated interest in learning more about returning. The Navy said about a half dozen sailors had so far expressed interest or sought more information, and the Air Force said it had not yet gotten any feedback from service members.",
      "The limited interest reflects what service leaders said early on, which was that many troops used the vaccine as a reason to leave and have moved on with their lives.",
      "Those eligible for back pay could get an amount that includes their basic salary, bonus payments, cost-of-living allowances and some health benefit costs. But that total will be reduced by any wages, veterans benefits, separation payments, debts and other amounts that were earned during that time.",
      "Service members will have to provide verified tax records and other paperwork as part of the process.",
      "According to the memo, the services must provide each person with an estimate of the amount of back pay they will receive. Service members will then have 60 days to decide whether to reenlist.",
      "Everyone who wants to reenlist must meet all military standards, including health, fitness and moral requirements. Service members have until Feb. 28, 2026, to seek reinstatement.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists\u2019 worries that the U.S. could tip into recession",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists' worries that the U.S. could tip into recession.",
      "The tariffs, set to take effect Wednesday, include a 10% blanket duty on nearly all countries and additional import taxes on 60 nations. The increases are so large and are taking effect so rapidly that they are likely to be disruptive to the economy, economists say, even if they are partially rolled back through negotiations in the coming weeks or months.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession \u2014 where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises \u2014 to 45%, from 35% last week. And even that forecast assumes many of the duties are negotiated away or reduced. If not, \u201cwe expect to change our forecast to a recession,\u201d Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist, and his colleagues said in an analyst note.",
      "Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.",
      "Should the tariffs remain in place for an extended period, they will likely raise costs and uncertainty for businesses, which could reduce their willingness to hire, invest in new equipment or software, or expand into new markets. Americans could cut back on their spending in the face of higher prices. The economy could start to shrink, after expanding 2.8% in 2024.",
      "So far, most measures of the economy, such as job gains, remain solid. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, the government reported last week, and layoffs remain historically low.",
      "Still, surveys show consumers and businesses are increasingly worried about the economic outlook. What everyone from Wall Street investors to economists to officials at the Federal Reserve will be watching closely is whether those concerns lead to a downturn.",
      "Here are some questions and answers about recessions:",
      "Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. It now indicates that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last year's final quarter.",
      "The Atlanta Fed's tracker is not technically a forecast but instead a running tally that is updated as economic data is released.",
      "Typically, a recession occurs when some short of shock hits the economy, such as the pandemic in 2020, or the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007. It's not yet clear that tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock the economy into reverse.",
      "But economists at Wells Fargo, in a note on Friday, calculated that the average U.S. tariff would jump tenfold to about 23% when all the duties are in place, the highest since 1908.",
      "Such a shift \u201cpractically overnight will throw sand in the gears of global supply chains in ways that we have not seen since the pandemic and perhaps since World War II,\u201d Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, wrote.",
      "On Sunday, Trump told reporters that \u201csometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\" Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said \u201cthere doesn't have to be a recession\u201d and that the administration is focused on \u201cbuilding the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.\u201d",
      "The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The government's weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist for Apollo, an asset management firm, is watching a range of real-time data and sees some signs the economy is weakening. The number of people filing for bankruptcy has risen, while visits to Las Vegas have declined a bit. Weekly visits to movie theaters this year are below their levels in recent years, he said.",
      "The Trump administration is plowing ahead with widespread job cuts in federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, and says it will cut government spending. Both could weigh on the economy, at least in the short run.",
      "And even if some of the tariffs imposed April 2 are pulled back or reduced, the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies are likely to discourage spending by businesses or consumers. It's unclear, for example, whether companies will build more factories in the U.S. \u2014 as the tariffs are intended to encourage \u2014 if they don't know how long the tariffs will last.",
      "Another factor could be overseas boycotts of U.S. goods and travel. Slok has noted that airline bookings data point to a 70% drop in trips from Canada to the U.S. in the next six months. While the effect on the overall economy is likely to be minor, Goldman Sachs estimates such changes could shave 0.2 percentage points off growth this year.",
      "Many economists now expect the Fed will cut their key interest rate at their meeting in June and implement at least three reductions this year.",
      "But the Fed is in a difficult position: With inflation seemingly stuck above its target of 2%, even before the tariffs take effect, the central bank would typically want to keep borrowing costs high to slow spending and cool inflation.",
      "Yet if tariffs weaken the economy and lead to job losses, the Fed would normally slash its key rate to stimulate borrowing and spending. Since tariffs could worsen inflation, however, it is unlikely to do so until there are clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t really be proactive here because they do have inflation to worry about,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is a Fed that is going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place.\"",
      "On Friday, Chair Jerome Powell said the tariffs could worsen inflation and added that the Fed's main obligation was to keep prices in check. His comments suggested the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines at its next meeting in May.",
      "Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d",
      "The committee considers trends in hiring. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It assigns heavy weight to a measure of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security.",
      "Yet the organization typically doesn\u2019t declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year afterward.",

      "JACKSON, Miss. -- A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant that claimed a local news outlet defamed him in public comments about its Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on the misspending of $77 million in federal welfare funds.",
      "The one-page ruling Friday by Madison County Circuit Court Judge Bradley Mills sided with lawyers for Mississippi Today, who had argued that the news outlet engaged in constitutionally protected speech.",
      "\u201cFor the past 22 months, we\u2019ve vigorously defended our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting and our characterizations of Bryant\u2019s role in the Mississippi welfare scandal,\u201d Mississippi Today said in a statement on its website. \u201cWe are grateful today that the court, after careful deliberation, dismissed the case.\u201d",
      "Bryant filed suit in 2023, weeks after Mississippi Today and one of its reporters, Anna Wolfe, won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of how welfare funds intended for poor Mississippians \u2014 some of the most impoverished people in the U.S. \u2014 were diverted to the rich and powerful.",
      "Bryant's lawsuit didn't challenge the accuracy of Wolfe\u2019s series, \u201cThe Backchannel,\u201d that shed light on the welfare scandal. Instead, Bryant's lawyers argued that the news outlet, its CEO and other employees made slanderous comments about Bryant when discussing the series in public settings, including a radio interview and a speech at a journalism conference.",
      "Attorneys for Mississippi Today argued that the comments Bryant claimed had harmed his reputation were \u201centirely or substantially true,\u201d and that Bryant failed to show any of the statements were made with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2014 meaning they were knowingly or recklessly false. Because of that, the lawyers said, Bryant didn't meet the legal standard for politicians and other public figures to prove defamation as set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964.",
      "Bryant's attorney, William Quin II, said Monday he will appeal the judge's dismissal to the Mississippi Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis matter is far from over,\u201d Quin said in an emailed statement. \"Governor Bryant remains confident in the legal basis of this case, and the righteousness of this cause.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists praised the judge's decision to throw out the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cSuing news organizations just because you don\u2019t like their reporting is a crude intimidation tactic that can drain resources and discourage critical coverage,\u201d Katherine Jacobsen, the committee's U.S. program coordinator, said in a statement posted on X. \"We hope that this case serves as a deterrent to those who would seek to sue outlets into silence.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have said the state\u2019s human services agency gave money to nonprofit organizations that spent it on projects such as a $5 million volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi \u2014 a project for which retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre agreed to raise money.",
      "Mississippi Auditor Shad White announced in February 2020 that criminal charges were brought against six people, including John Davis, a former Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director who had been chosen by Bryant. The announcement came weeks after Bryant, a Republican, finished his second and final term as governor. Davis and others have pleaded guilty.",
      "No criminal charges have been filed against Bryant, and he has said he told the auditor in 2019 about possible misspending of money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families antipoverty program.",
      "Favre also has not been charged with a crime. The Pro Football Hall of Famer is among more than three dozen defendants in a civil lawsuit the state filed in 2022. The suit demands repayment of money that was misspent through TANF.",
      "White, the Republican state auditor, said in 2020 that Favre had improperly received $1.1 million in speaking fees from a nonprofit organization that spent welfare money with approval from the state Department of Human Services. White said Favre did not show up for the speeches. Although Favre repaid the $1.1 million, White said last year that he still owes nearly $730,000 in interest.",

      "In a statement released on Sunday, the Frankfort, Kentucky-based distillery said it would remain closed through April 10 but warned that date could change.",

      "A spokesperson for Buffalo Trace declined to comment further.",

Notably, the distillery has markers of several high-water marks from previous floods inside its Frankfort buildings, with the most recent being the 1978 flood.",

      "A former top vaccine official says he was forced out of government after trying to block Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Shortly before he was forced to resign, the nation\u2019s top vaccine regulator says he refused to grant Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a tightly held vaccine safety database, fearing that the information might be manipulated or even deleted.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks discussed his efforts to \u201cmake nice\u201d with Kennedy and address his longstanding concerns about vaccine safety, including by developing a \u201cvaccine transparency action plan.\u201d",
      "Marks agreed to give Kennedy's associates the ability to read thousands of reports of potential vaccine-related issues sent to the government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. But he would not allow them to directly edit the data.",
      "\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we? Because frankly we don\u2019t trust (them),\u201d he said, using a profanity. \u201cThey\u2019d write over it or erase the whole database.\u201d",
      "Marks spoke to the AP on Sunday, after officials in Texas confirmed the nation's second measles-related death this year in an unvaccinated child. Marks attributed the death to the tepid response from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which again encouraged the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine on Sunday but has also promoted claims about vitamin A supplements.",
      "During his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy told lawmakers he is not \u201cantivaccine.\" But since taking office, he\u2019s promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d children\u2019s shots, and agencies under his watch have terminated vaccine-related research, canceled meetings of vaccine advisers and are poised to reinvestigate ties between vaccines and autism \u2014 a link debunked long ago.",
      "Since being sworn in, \u201cMr. Kennedy has increased the pace by which he intends to minimize the use of vaccines in this country,\u201d Marks said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said Kennedy has advocated for vaccination multiple times since becoming health secretary and pointed to a social media post Sunday in which he called the vaccine \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson added that it would make \u201cperfect sense\u201d for staffers working for Kennedy to seek access to the VAERS database to do their own analysis.",
      "Marks is highly regarded by former FDA leaders and biotech industry executives, but his time at the agency has not been without controversy. During the COVID-19 pandemic he was alternately criticized for being too slow \u2014 under Trump\u2014 and too fast \u2014 under Biden\u2014 to authorize new vaccines and boosters.",
      "Marks says he \u201ctried everything\u201d to work with Kennedy. At the center of that effort was a plan to increase publicly available information about vaccine ingredients, safety and side effects.",
      "Marks and his team had hoped to kick off the monthslong initiative with a two-day public \u201clistening session,\u201d followed by an expert report written by an independent organization, such as the National Academies of Sciences.",
      "The centerpiece of the effort would be a vast overhaul of the VAERS system, maintained by the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FDA and CDC scientists monitor the database for \u201cpossible signals\u201d of emerging problems with vaccines. But analyzing the data requires both medical and statistical expertise, because anyone can submit unverified reports of side effects, injuries and death. The public-facing website warns that the data is unverified and may be incomplete or inaccurate. Misinterpretations of VAERS have long been central to anti-vaccine groups and messaging.",
      "Marks notes that government scientists spend hours adjudicating each report of serious injury or death, often by tracking down death certificates and interviewing health providers. It\u2019s not unusual for investigators to find reports of deaths that were caused by something totally unrelated to a vaccine, like a car crash, or that a death occurred months after vaccination in someone with a serious illness.",
      "Much of that detail is redacted for legal reasons. But Marks said his office was committed to making much more information available.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate thing that I actually was willing to compromise on,\u201d Marks said \u201cWe need to make VAERS more transparent so that people can understand that we actually do the work on the backend.\u201d",
      "Details of Marks' plan were confirmed by a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly about internal agency matters.",
      "The proposal was sent to FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Trump appointee Dr. Sara Brenner, in mid-February, but Marks and his team did not hear back.",
      "By mid-March, Marks' office was fielding multiple requests from Trump administration staffers seeking full access to the VAERS database. In responding to the requests, Marks and his staff emphasized the sensitive nature of the data, which includes confidential personal, medical and corporate information.",
      "Marks said he never spoke directly with Kennedy, whom he described as \u201cwalled off\u201d from FDA officials.",
      "On the day he was forced out of his post, Marks said he was summoned to a meeting at HHS headquarters.",
      "Two senior HHS officials greeted him and recalled Marks' work during the COVID-19 pandemic; he coined the name and developed the concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d which rapidly accelerated the development of vaccines and therapies to treat the virus.",
      "After an awkward silence, Marks said, one of the officials told him: \u201cLook, he wants you gone.\u201d According to Marks, it was an obvious reference to Kennedy.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty clear that either I was going to resign, or they were going to fire me,\u201d Marks said.",
      "He submitted his resignation later that day, citing Kennedy\u2019s support for \u201cmisinformation and lies\" about vaccines.",

      "Government lawyers have argued that Trump can remove both board members. In Wilcox\u2019s case, they said reinstatement \"works a grave harm to the separation of powers and undermines the President\u2019s ability to exercise his authority under the Constitution.\u201d",
      "They also argued that MSPB members like Harris are removable \u201cat will\u201d by the president.",

      "Alabama Republicans cheered President Donald Trump and his agenda at a GOP party the day he imposed tariffs and sent stock markets tumbling worldwide",
      "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- On a day when stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl led a celebration of the president whose global tariffs sparked the sell-off.",
      "With no mention of the Wall Street roller coaster and global economic uncertainty, Wahl declared his state GOP\u2019s \u201cTrump Victory Dinner\u201d \u2014 and the broader national moment \u2014 a triumph. And for anyone who rejects President Donald Trump, his agenda and the \u201cAmerica First\u201d army that backs it all, Wahl had an offer: \u201cThe Alabama Republican Party will buy them a plane ticket to any country in the world they want to go to.\u201d",
      "Wahl's audience \u2014 an assembly of lobbyists and donors, state lawmakers, local party officials and grassroots activists \u2014 laughed, applauded and sometimes roared throughout last week's gala in downtown Birmingham, the rare Democratic stronghold in one of the nation\u2019s most Republican states. The president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. elicited perhaps the most enthusiasm with an unapologetically partisan pitch, even repeating the lie that his father won the 2020 election over Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Yet beyond the cheerleading, there were signs of a more cautious optimism and some worried whispers over Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, the particulars of his deportation policy and the aggressive slashing by his Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Trump or Republicans are in danger of losing their grip in Alabama, where the GOP holds all statewide offices, dominates the Legislature and has won every presidential electoral vote since 1980. But it\u2019s a notable wrinkle in a place where there's long been tension between relying on the federal government for funding and jobs, and an embrace of the kind of anti-Washington, anti-establishment populism that has twice propelled Trump to the Oval Office. And any cracks for Trump in Alabama \u2014 where he got 65% of the vote in 2024 \u2014 could portend trouble elsewhere, as the effects of a seismic shift in U.S. policy reach across the economy and society.",
      "\u201cThere are some concerns, some conversations,\u201d said John Merrill, a former secretary of state, over just what Trump\u2019s agenda will mean on the ground. Alabama, he acknowledged, has \u201cbeen a net recipient\u201d of the very federal government and economic model Trump is upending, meaning it receives more money back from Washington than its taxpayers send the federal government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big risk,\u201d said Merrill, who sported a Trump 45-47 pin on his lapel, a nod to the president's two terms.",
      "Blocks to the south of the complex where Republicans convened sits the multibillion-dollar University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, a regional gem where research depends on grants from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Republican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, listed as a \u201cSilver Sponsor\u201d of the gala, didn't join the Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration to stop the cancellation of certain research funding streams Congress already has approved.",
      "Most of the medical services provided at UAB and many other hospitals throughout the state are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, two of the largest federal outlays. Alabama, because its per-capita income ranks among the lower tier among states, has one of the most generous federal match rates for Medicaid funding.",
      "A short drive west toward Tuscaloosa sits a gargantuan Mercedes-Benz complex, one of the earliest examples of foreign auto manufacturers coming to the American South, where state laws are hostile to organized labor. The plants have provided jobs at wages higher than the local norms but in some cases lower than in union shops of the Great Lakes region around Detroit. Many suppliers have followed in the South, but not so many that the assembly plants don\u2019t still import many parts that now will be subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Terry Martin, a county GOP committeeman in Tallapoosa County, said he supports the tariffs as leverage. Trump has \u201csomething to bargain with,\u201d Martin said. But, \u201cthe parts that are coming from overseas \u2026 it\u2019s going to pop it up\u201d in price, he said, at least in the short term.",
      "Agriculture, meanwhile, is still a dominant Alabama industry. Meat processing plants in the North and row crop farms in the South depend on migrant labor that Merrill, the former secretary of state, said involves workers who are in the U.S. both legally and illegally. Alabama, he recalled, passed its own strict immigration bill during Barack Obama's presidency only to roll it back after industry leaders complained of a depleted workforce.",
      "Wahl, in an interview after the gala, took a more nuanced approach than he did at the podium.",
      "\u201cIt is possible to secure our border and still take into account migrants who deserve to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be a two-pronged approach.\u201d",
      "Back in Birmingham, Interstate 65 splits the city. The aging, increasingly congested artery is a local priority for widening. The proposal has support from Alabama's two Republican senators, Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt. U.S. interstate projects, though, are typically a 90-10 split, meaning 90% of the money comes from Washington, 10% from the state.",
      "That funding \u2014 along with money for schools, Medicaid and other areas \u2014 could be at risk with Trump adviser Elon Musk and DOGE carrying Trump\u2019s blessing to slash spending. GOP lawmakers who control Congress have supported Trump's agenda, which also includes dismantling the Education Department.",
      "Tallapoosa County GOP Chair Denise Bates said \u201cabsolutely\u201d there's a possibility DOGE could go too far. \u201cI hope there are guardrails,\u201d she said, noting she was once a local school board member.",
      "\u201cAm I 100% for getting rid of the Department of Education? I can\u2019t say that I am,\u201d she said, adding a phrase similar to Merrill\u2019s description of the state as a whole. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re a net receiver.\u201d",
      "Yet for all the caveats offered in one-on-one conversations, the GOP crowd cheered when Tuberville, the former football coach turned Trump acolyte on Capitol Hill, offered a plainspoken defense of Musk and his pop-up agency, telling the crowd, \u201cWe're dead broke.\u201d And they roared as he addressed tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt's past time we level the playing field and tell the rest of the world to get off their ass and start paying their fair share,\u201d Tuberville said.",
      "Bates argued that Alabama's embrace of Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d push is not simply loyalty to the president. She said it reflects generations of voters watching the steel industry decline in Birmingham and, after the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994, the textile industry leaving for Mexico and, eventually, Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cWe just want jobs,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, state Sen. Jabo Waggoner, the longest-serving member of the Alabama Legislature, made clear Trump's visceral appeal, declaring him \u201cthe most popular president here since Ronald Reagan, hands down.\u201d",
      "Wahl recalled Trump\u2019s first massive outdoor rally as a presidential candidate: 30,000 people at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, in August 2015.",
      "Wahl, who owns a butterfly farm outside Huntsville, said perhaps the best way to understand Trump and Alabama and this moment of uncertainty is to see a president who, at least to his supporters in the state, has earned the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to let everybody know he\u2019s serious,\u201d the chairman said. Trump is \u201cgoing to bring people to the bargaining table. We\u2019re actually going to see the negotiator conduct business.\u201d",

      "An appellate court in Russia\u2019s far eastern city of Vladivostok has reduced the prison sentence of an American soldier convicted of stealing and making threats of murder",
      "MOSCOW -- An appellate court in Russia\u2019s far east on Monday reduced the prison sentence for an American soldier convicted of stealing and making threats of murder, Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti reported.",
      "Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, 34, flew to the Pacific port city of Vladivostok to see his girlfriend and was arrested in May 2024 after she accused him of stealing from her, according to U.S. officials and Russian authorities. A month later, a court in Vladivostok convicted him and sentenced him to three years and nine months in prison. Black was also ordered to pay 10,000 rubles ($115 at the time) in damages.",
      "Black lost one appeal in a regional court that upheld his sentence, but the judge in the 9th Court of Cassation on Monday agreed to reduce his sentence to three years and two months in prison. Black's defense had asked the court to acquit him of making threats of murder and reduce the punishment for theft, a request the judge partially sustained, according to the RIA report.",
      "Russia has jailed a number of Americans in recent years as tensions between Moscow and the West grew. Some, like corporate security executive Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and teacher Marc Fogel, were designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained and released in prisoner swaps.",
      "A few others remain jailed in Russia on drug or assault convictions. They include Robert Gilman, 72, who was handed a 3 1/2-year sentence after being found guilty of assaulting a police officer following a drunken disturbance on a train, and Travis Leake, a musician who was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 13 years in prison in July 2024.",
      "Black was on leave and in the process of returning to his home base at Fort Cavazos, Texas, from South Korea, where he had been stationed at Camp Humphreys with the Eighth Army.",
      "The U.S. Army said Black signed out for his move back home and, \u201cinstead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew from Incheon, Republic of Korea, through China to Vladivostok, Russia, for personal reasons.\u201d",
      "Under Pentagon policy, service members must get clearance for any international travel from a security manager or commander.",
      "The U.S. Army said last month that Black hadn\u2019t sought such travel clearance and it wasn\u2019t authorized by the Defense Department. Given the hostilities in Ukraine and threats to the U.S. and its military, it is extremely unlikely he would have been granted approval.",
      "Black\u2019s girlfriend, Alexandra Vashchuk, told reporters last year that \u201cit was a simple domestic dispute,\u201d during which Black \u201cbecame aggressive and attacked\u201d her, stealing money from her wallet. She described Black as \u201cviolent and unable to control himself.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said that Black, who is married, met Vashchuk in South Korea.",
      "According to U.S. officials, she had lived in South Korea, and last fall she and Black got into some type of domestic dispute or altercation. After that, she left South Korea. It isn\u2019t clear if she was forced to leave or what, if any, role South Korean authorities had in the matter.",

      "The settlement of a $2.8 billion federal class-action antitrust lawsuit filed by athletes against the NCAA and the largest conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) was approved by the defendants and plaintiffs in May 2024 and not long afterwa...",
      "The settlement of a $2.8 billion federal class-action antitrust lawsuit filed by athletes against the NCAA and the largest conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) was approved by the defendants and plaintiffs in May 2024 and not long afterward by U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken, who must give final approval before terms can go into effect as early as July 1. Some questions and answers about this monumental change for college athletics:",
      "Q: What is the House settlement and why does it matter?",
      "A: Grant House is an Arizona State swimmer who sued the defendants. His lawsuit and two others were combined and over several years the dispute wound up with the proposed settlement that will create a new substructure for college sports. What's groundbreaking is that it ends a decades-old prohibition on schools cutting checks directly to athletes. Now, each schools will be able to make so-called NIL payments to athletes, compensating them for use of their name, image and likeness.",
      "Q: How much will the schools pay the athletes and where will the money come from?",
      "A: In Year 1, each school can share up to about $20.5 million with their athletes, a number that represents 22% of their revenue from things like media rights, ticket sales and sponsorships. Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne famously told Congress \"those are resources and revenues that don\u2019t exist.\u201d Some of it will be raised through ever-growing TV rights packages, especially for the newly expanded College Football Playoff. But some schools are increasing costs to fans through \u201ctalent fees,\u201d concession price hikes and \u201cathletic fees\u201d added to tuition costs.",
      "Q: What about scholarships? Wasn't that like paying the athletes?",
      "A: Scholarships and \u201ccost of attendance\u201d have always been part of the deal for Division I athletes, and there's certainly value to that, especially if athletes get their degree. But they have long argued that it was hardly enough to compensate them for the millions in revenue they helped produce for the schools, which went to a lot of places, including multimillion-dollar coaches' salaries.",
      "Q: Haven't players been getting paid for a while now, though?",
      "A: Yes, since 2021. Facing losses in court and a growing number of state laws targeting its amateurism policies, the NCAA cleared the way for athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, including so-called donor-based collectives that support various schools. Under House, the school can pay that money directly to athletes and the collectives are still in the game.",
      "Q: What about players who played before NIL was allowed?",
      "A: A key component of the settlement is the $2.78 billion in backpay going to athletes who competed between 2016-24 and were either fully or partially shut out from those payments. It will come from the NCAA and conferences (but really from the schools, who will receive lower-than-normal payouts from things like March Madness).",
      "Q: Who will get most of the money?",
      "A: Since football and men's basketball are the primary revenue drivers at most schools, and that money helps fund all the other sports, it stands to reason that the football and basketball players will get most of the money. But that is one of the most difficult calculations for the schools to make.",
      "Q: Couldn't unequal divvying of the money open up issues of fairness, equity and Title IX?",
      "A: Yes, there could potentially be Title IX issues if schools deliver more resources to men than women. But the most recent guidance from the Trump administration suggests schools won't have to consider NIL payments in their Title IX calculations. Attorneys on both sides in the House case have argued that the settlement is not the arena to resolve Title IX issues.",
      "Q: Is this a done deal?",
      "A: That's an open question. Wilken could do it as soon as Monday or wait to craft a decision after weighing objections. She could scuttle the entire thing, though she granted preliminary approval in October. Currently, the terms of the deal are set to start July 1.",
      "Q: So, once this is finished, all of college sports' problems are solved, right?",
      "A: Not by a long shot. Some of the more pressing issues include establishing an enforcement entity to make sure schools are staying within the spending guidelines and what to do if they're not \u2014 an area that seems ripe for litigation. There are also the issues of collective bargaining and whether athletes should flat-out be considered employees, a notion the NCAA and schools are not interested in. NCAA President Charlie Baker has been pushing Congress for a limited antitrust exemption that would protect college sports from another series of lawsuits.",

      "Hours before college basketball crowns its next champion, the future of college sports will be hanging in the balance in a California courtroom.",
      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken's scheduled hearing Monday in a courtroom in Oakland is expected to be the last one before the changes will truly begin under an industry-changing, $2.8 billion settlement of a five-year-old lawsuit against the NCAA and the nation's largest conferences. Among other things, it will clear the way for schools to pay up to $20.5 million each with their athletes.",
      "Wilken has already granted preliminary approval for the settlement. It was unknown whether she will give final approval at Monday's hearing, which is expected to include testimony from some of those objecting to details of the sprawling plan. LSU gymnast and influencer Olivia Dunne is among the 18 people scheduled to testify, though she is expected to appear via Zoom.",
      "The new structure outlined by the settlement, which represents a shift in billions of dollars from the schools into the pockets of athletes, is supposed to go into effect on July 1.",
      "Universities across the country have been busy making plans, under the assumption Wilken will put the terms into effect.",
      "\u201cWe're going to have a plan going into July 1, then we're probably going to spend the next year figuring out how good that plan is and how we need to modify it going forward,\u201d said Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin, whose department is among the biggest in the country and includes a Gators men's basketball team playing for the national title late Monday against Houston.",
      "The so-called House settlement, named after Arizona State swimmer Grant House, actually decides three similar lawsuits that were bundled into one. The defendants are the NCAA and the Southeastern, Big Ten, Atlantic Coast, Big 12 and Pac-12 conferences, all of whom have been touting the settlement as the best path forward for their industry.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge step forward for college sports, especially at the highest level,\" said NCAA President Charlie Baker, whose organization continues to seek antitrust protections from Congress. \u201cMy biggest problem with the way the whole thing works right now is the schools have been removed from the primary relationship with the student-athletes.\u201d",
      "The most ground-shifting part of the settlement calls on schools from the biggest conferences to pay some 22% of their revenue from media rights, ticket sales and sponsorships \u2014 which equals about $20.5 million in the first year \u2014 directly to athletes for use of their name, images and likeness (NIL).",
      "Still allowed would be NIL payments to athletes from outside sources, which is what triggered the seismic shift college sports has endured over the last four years. For instance, Cooper Flagg of Duke reportedly makes $4.8 million in NIL deals from groups affiliated with the school and others.",
      "The settlement calls for a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d to make sure any NIL deal worth more than $600 is pegged at \u201cfair market value.\" It's an attempt to prevent straight \u201cpay for play\u201d deals, though many critics believe the entire new structure is simply NIL masquerading as that.",
      "Another key element is the $2.8 billion in back damages to athletes who played sports between 2016 and 2024 and were not entitled to the full benefits of NIL at the time they attended schools. Those payments are being calculated by a formula that will favor football and basketball players and will be doled out by the NCAA and the conferences.",
      "The settlement also calls for replacing scholarship limits with roster limits. The effect would be to allow every athlete to be eligible for a scholarship while cutting the number of spots available.",
      "There will be winners and losers under such a formula, though some fear it could signal the end of the \u201cwalk-on\u201d athlete in college sports and also imperil smaller sports programs that train and populate the U.S. Olympic team.",

      "A mother with doomsday religious beliefs who was convicted of killing her two youngest children and conspiring to kill a romantic rival in Idaho is on trial again",
      "PHOENIX -- Lori Vallow Daybell, the Idaho mother with doomsday religious beliefs who was convicted of killing her two youngest children and conspiring to murder a romantic rival, is on trial again. This time, she's accused in Arizona of conspiring to murder her estranged husband.",
      "The case has drawn public attention in part because Vallow Daybell, 51, has doomsday-focused religious beliefs. She isn't a lawyer but has chosen to represent herself in the six-week trial. Opening statements are scheduled Monday in a Phoenix courtroom.",
      "Prosecutors say she conspired with her brother to kill Charles Vallow, so she could collect money from his life insurance policy and marry her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell, an Idaho author who wrote several religious novels about prophecies and the end of the world.",
      "Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty and has not spoken publicly about the details of Vallow's death. Here's what to know about the case.",
      "Vallow was fatally shot in July 2019. Vallow Daybell then moved to Idaho with her children, Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow and Tylee Ryan. She married Daybell just two weeks after the death of his wife, Tammy Daybell. The children went missing for several months before their bodies were found buried in rural Idaho on Chad Daybell\u2019s property. JJ was 7 and Tylee was 16.",
      "Vallow Daybell is already serving three life sentences in Idaho for the children's deaths and for conspiring to kill Tammy Daybell. Chad Daybell was sentenced to death in the three killings.",
      "Four months before he died, Charles Vallow filed for divorce from Vallow Daybell, saying she had become infatuated with near-death experiences and had claimed to have lived numerous lives on other planets.",
      "He alleged she threatened to ruin him financially and kill him. He sought a voluntary mental health evaluation of his wife.",
      "Police say Vallow was fatally shot by Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, when Vallow went to pick up his son at Vallow Daybell\u2019s home in Chandler, a Phoenix suburb. Vallow Daybell\u2019s daughter, Tylee, told police that she confronted Vallow with a baseball bat after she was awakened by yelling in the house.",
      "Tylee said she was trying to defend her mother, but Vallow took away the bat, according to police records. Cox told police that he fired after Vallow refused to drop the bat and came after him.",
      "Cox told investigators that Vallow Daybell and the children left the house shortly before the shooting. Investigators say she went to get fast food for her son and bought flip-flops at a pharmacy before returning home.",
      "Cox, who claimed he acted in self-defense and wasn\u2019t arrested in Vallow\u2019s death, died five months later from what medical examiners said was a blood clot in his lungs. Cox's account was later called into question.",
      "Vallow Daybell was a beautician by trade, a mother of three and a wife \u2014 five times over.",
      "Her first marriage, to a high school sweetheart when she was 19, ended quickly. She married again in her early 20s and had a son. Then, in 2001, she married Joseph Ryan, and they had Tylee. They divorced a few years later, and Ryan died in 2018 at his home of a suspected heart attack.",
      "Charles Vallow entered the picture several months later. Vallow and Vallow Daybell married in 2006 and later adopted JJ, but by 2019 their marriage had soured. The two were estranged but still married when Cox fatally shot Vallow.",
      "Public interest from around the world only grew as the investigation into the missing children took several unexpected turns, each new revelation seemingly stranger than the last.",
      "Daybell, who was once a contestant on \u201cWheel of Fortune,\u201d has been the subject of a Netflix documentary and Lifetime movie.",
      "While representing herself, Vallow Daybell has complained about news coverage of her criminal cases, invoked her right to a speedy trial, questioned whether a government witness was truly an expert and engaged in disputes over the pre-trial exchange of evidence.",
      "At a hearing last week, she lost a bid to strike three people from the prosecution\u2019s witness list, including the grandmother of her adopted son. Another witness says Vallow Daybell spoke about Vallow as being \u201cpossessed\u201d in the months before his death. When the judge asked her to argue her point, Vallow Daybell lowered her head, sighed and paused a few seconds. \u201cTheir information is not firsthand,\" Vallow Daybell said. \"These witnesses are all coming together. They are watching everything that goes on on TV regarding this.\u201d",
      "If convicted in Arizona of conspiring to kill Vallow, she would face a life sentence.",
      "Vallow Daybell will wear civilian clothing during her trial and will not be handcuffed or shackled when jurors are in the courtroom. She, however, is expected to be wearing a belt-like device under her clothes that will let a jail officer deliver an electric shock by remote control if there's a disturbance.",
      "The Idaho investigation began at the end of 2019 when Vallow Daybell's adopted son's grandmother, worried about his welfare, reached out to police. Vallow Daybell had been evasive when asked about her two youngest children.",
      "Chad Daybell called 911 in October 2019 to report that his wife Tammy Daybell was battling an illness and died in her sleep. Her body was later exhumed, and an autopsy determined she died of asphyxiation.",
      "Idaho police did a welfare check on the kids in November 2019 and discovered they were missing and hadn't been seen since early September. Vallow Daybell and Chad Daybell left town a short time later, eventually turning up in Hawaii without the kids. She was arrested in Hawaii in February 2020 on a warrant out of Idaho.",
      "Defense attorneys told jurors that she was a \u201ckind and loving mother\u201d who happened to be interested in religion and biblical prophesies.",
      "A witness at the Idaho trial said Vallow Daybell believes evil spirits have taken over people in her life and turned them into \u201czombies.\u201d",

      "She's scheduled to go on trial again in late May on a charge of conspiring to murder Brandon Boudreaux, the ex-husband of Vallow Daybell's niece, Melani Pawlowski.",
      "Someone in a Jeep fired a gunshot at Boudreaux in 2019 outside his home in a Phoenix suburb, missing him but striking his car. The Jeep matched the description of one registered to Charles Vallow, who was killed nearly three months prior to the shooting outside Boudreaux\u2019s home.",

      "Lori Vallow Daybell is already serving life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two youngest children and conspiring to kill her lover's wife",
      "PHOENIX -- It's a complex case that led investigators from Arizona to Idaho and Hawaii, to unravel a twisted plot built on bizarre claims that the victims were possessed by evil spirits and that the defendant \u2014 Lori Vallow Daybell \u2014 was after money from a life insurance policy and chasing a marriage with a new lover.",
      "Vallow Daybell is already serving three life sentences in Idaho for murdering her two youngest children and conspiring to kill her lover's wife. Now, she's on trial in Arizona \u2014 on charges she conspired to kill her estranged husband in 2019. Prosecutors contend she had help from her brother and that doomsday prophecies peddled by her boyfriend and soon-to-be husband Chad Daybell played a role in the death of Charles Vallow.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at some of the people connected to the case.",
      "Vallow Daybell, 51, was a beautician by trade, a mother of three and has been married five times.",
      "She married her high school sweetheart when she was 19. It ended quickly, but she married again in her early 20s and had a son. With her third husband, Joseph Ryan, she had a daughter. That ended after a few years, and Ryan later died in his home of a suspected heart attack.",
      "In the summer of 2019, her fourth husband \u2014 Charles \u2014 was shot to death by her brother. That's when she moved with her daughter Tylee Ryan and youngest son Joshua \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow to southeastern Idaho, where she could be closer to Chad. That September, the children disappeared, and prosecutors said Chad and his wife at the time, Tammy Daybell, applied to increase Tammy\u2019s life insurance benefit.",
      "Tammy died the next month, and Chad Daybell and Vallow Daybell got married two weeks later. Authorities grew suspicious about Tammy's death and had her body exhumed for an autopsy, which determined she died of asphyxiation. The children\u2019s bodies were found in 2020, buried in Chad Daybell\u2019s yard.",
      "During her sentencing, Vallow Daybell said \u201caccidental deaths happen.\u201d She claimed the spirits of the three victims visited her regularly and were all happy in the \u201cspirit world.\u201d",
      "Charles Vallow, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, entered the picture several months after Vallow Daybell and Joseph Ryan divorced. Vallow Daybell joined the faith \u2014 commonly known as the Mormon church \u2014 and the two married in 2006. They later adopted \u201cJJ\u201d Vallow.",
      "The marriage soured by 2019. Charles filed for divorce, contending in court papers that Vallow Daybell believed herself to be a deity tasked with helping usher in the biblical apocalypse.",
      "The two were estranged but still married when Vallow Daybell\u2019s brother, Alex Cox, shot and killed Charles outside his suburban Phoenix home. Cox told police the shooting was in self-defense and was never charged in the case. He died months later of a blood clot in his lungs.",
      "Chad Daybell, 56, married Tammy Daybell in 1990. They had five kids and a home in rural southeastern Idaho. He also was a member of the Mormon church and loosely crafted his works of fiction on its teachings.",
      "Prosecutors have said that Chad Daybell met Vallow Daybell at a conference in Utah in 2018. Chad insisted they had been married in several previous lives and that she was a \u201csexual goddess\u201d who would help him save the world. The couple led a group of friends in trying to cast out evil spirits by praying and doing what they called \u201cenergy work,\" prosecutors said.",
      "They believed a person could become a zombie in some cases, and the only way to banish a zombie was to kill the person, friends said. One friend told police she heard Vallow Daybell call the children zombies before they disappeared.",
      "Idaho jurors convicted Chad in 2024 in the triple-murder plot. They deliberated just over a day before sentencing him to death.",
      "Friends of Cox and Vallow Daybell testified in 2023 that the siblings were very close, and that Cox believed he was put on the Earth to serve as her protector.",
      "During Vallow Daybell\u2019s trial in Idaho, prosecutors presented witnesses and evidence that appeared to tie Cox to the deaths, including GPS data on his phone that was traced to where the children\u2019s bodies were found.",
      "Cox's wife, Zulema Pastenes, testified that her husband also believed people could be possessed and become zombies. She said Cox called himself the \u201cfall guy\u201d after learning that Tammy's body was being exhumed, but he didn't elaborate.",
      "Kay Woodcock is Vallow's sister and JJ\u2019s grandmother. She's on the prosecution\u2019s witness list.",
      "In 2019, she persuaded police in Idaho to check on JJ after her regular phone calls and visits with the boy stopped. A search for JJ and Tylee ensued, with police asking for the public's help and the Woodcock family creating a website where people could leave tips. A reward also was offered.",
      "Charles Vallow adopted JJ as a baby because the boy's biological parents were unable to care for him.",
      "In the Idaho proceedings, Woodcock told jurors that JJ was born with some disabilities and was diagnosed with autism. After Charles died, Woodcock feared Vallow Daybell no longer wanted the boy. She also worried that JJ may had witnessed his father\u2019s death.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukraine will send a team to Washington next week to begin negotiations on a new draft of a deal that would give the U.S. access to Ukraine\u2019s valuable mineral resources, Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe new draft agreement from the U.S. shows that the intention to create a fund or jointly invest remains,\u201d Svyrydenko said Saturday, during a trip to northern Ukraine.",
      "The delegation from Kyiv will include representatives from the Ministries of Economy, Foreign Affairs, Justice and Finance.",
      "The long-running negotiations over a mineral deal have already strained relations between Kyiv and Washington. The two sides had been preparing in February to sign a framework agreement but the plan was derailed following a contentious meeting in the Oval Office between U.S. President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "After some Ukrainian lawmakers leaked the new draft, critics slammed it as little more than an attempt to strip Kyiv of control over its own natural resources and infrastructure. According to the leaked document, the new draft includes not only rare-earth minerals but gas and oil.",
      "Ukraine holds significant deposits of more than 20 minerals deemed strategically critical by the U.S., including titanium, which is used to make aircraft wings, lithium, key to several battery technologies, and uranium, used in nuclear power.",
      "Despite the disruption following the Oval Office meeting, Ukrainian officials showed interest in signing the framework deal at any time, seeing it as an important step to win the favor of President Donald Trump and shore up U.S. backing in the war against Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion.",
      "After weeks of silence on the status of the deal, the U.S. sent a new draft to Kyiv, which goes further than the original framework.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why the U.S. chose to bypass the signing of the framework deal and instead moved forward with a more comprehensive draft agreement, which would likely require ratification by Ukraine\u2019s parliament.",
      "However, Ukrainian officials have been cautious about commenting on the contents of the draft, stressing that it currently reflects only one side\u2019s position.",
      "\u201cWhat we have now is a document that reflects the position of the U.S. Treasury legal team,\u201d said Svyrydenko. \u201cThis is not a final version, it\u2019s not a joint position.\u201d",
      "She said that Ukraine\u2019s task now is to assemble a technical team for negotiations, define its red lines and core principles, and send a delegation to Washington for technical talks as early as next week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the full parameters of this agreement can\u2019t be discussed online,\u201d Svyrydenko said. \u201cWe need to sit down with the teams and continue the conversation in person.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis marks a new stage in relations with the United States \u2014 one that requires expertise across multiple areas,\u201d she said. \u201cUltimately, everything will be decided through the course of negotiations.\u201d",
      "Svyrydenko declined to elaborate publicly on Ukraine\u2019s official evaluation of the new draft, but noted that there is now a more detailed document outlining the fund\u2019s creation. And while the initial draft focused primarily on the intention to establish the fund, Svyrydenko said the latest version lays out how American advisers envision its structure and operation.",
      "It remains unclear what role Ukraine would play in managing the fund under the newly proposed U.S. draft. However, analysts who reviewed the leaked document said Kyiv\u2019s involvement would likely be minimal \u2014 a point Ukraine hopes to challenge in upcoming negotiations, using the previously agreed framework as its reference.",
      "A previous version of the framework agreement, obtained by The Associated Press, outlined plans for a jointly owned and managed investment fund between the United States and Ukraine, intended to support the reconstruction of Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy.",
      "Under the terms, Ukraine would allocate 50% of future revenues generated from key national assets \u2014 including minerals, hydrocarbons, oil, natural gas, and other extractable resources \u2014 to the fund.",
      "The framework agreement, which was never signed, stated that revenues from its natural resources would go into the fund and be used for the reconstruction of the country, not that ownership or control of those resources would be transferred to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very focused on ensuring that the final draft of the agreement, after negotiations, fully aligns with our strategic interests,\u201d Svyrydenko said. \u201cI believe the work on the previous memorandum showed that both teams are capable of reaching these goals and agreeing on terms acceptable to both sides.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of flights have been canceled and more than 6,400 flights delayed, according to FlightAware.com, which reported 74 cancellations and 478 delays of U.S. flights early Sunday. The flooding also led to road closures in Kentucky and southern Illinois, among other places.",

      "A recent immigration enforcement action that resulted in the arrests of employees and owners at a Texas bakery has shocked residents of the town of Los Fresnos",
      "LOS FRESNOS, Texas -- Leonardo Baez and Nora Avila-Guel's bakery in the Texas community of Los Fresnos is a daily stop for many residents to share gossip over coffee and pick up cakes and pastries for birthdays, office parties or themselves.",
      "When Homeland Security Investigations agents showed up at Abby\u2019s Bakery in February and arrested the owners and eight employees, residents of Los Fresnos were shocked. Abby's Bakery doesn't employ violent criminals and Baez and Avila-Guel are not the people who border czar Tom Homan calls the \u201cworst of the worst\u201d and says are the priority for mass deportations.",
      "\u201cI was surprised because I know that they\u2019re not taking advantage of the people,\u201d Esteban Rodriguez, 43, said after pulling into the bakery\u2019s parking lot to discover it was closed. \u201cIt was more like helping out people. They didn\u2019t have nowhere to go, instead of them being on the streets.\u201d",
      "The reaction in the town of 8,500 residents may show the limits of support for President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown in a majority Hispanic region dotted with fields of cotton, sugarcane and red grapefruit where Republicans made gains in last year's elections. Cameron County voted for a GOP president for the first time since 2004. For neighboring Starr County, it was the first time since 1896.",
      "Now, Baez and Avila-Guel, a Mexican couple who are legal U.S. permanent residents, could lose everything after being accused of concealing and harboring immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally. It's a rare case in which business owners face criminal charges rather than just a fine.",
      "Los Fresnos, which is 90% Latino and counts the school district as its largest employer, is about a half-hour drive from the U.S.-Mexico border. Hundreds of school bus drivers, painters, retirees and parishioners from the nearby Catholic church come into Abby\u2019s Bakery each day. Customers with silver trays and tongs select pastries from glass-door cabinets.",
      "Six of Abby's eight employees were in the U.S. on visitor visas but none had work permits when Homeland Security Investigations agents came to the business Feb. 12. The owners acknowledged they knew that, according to a federal complaint.",
      "Employees lived in a room with six beds and shared two bathrooms in the same building as the bakery, according to an agent's affidavit.",
      "Baez, 55, and Avila-Guel, 46, have pleaded not guilty. They referred questions to their attorneys, who noted the workers were not held against their will and there was no attempt to hide their presence, as a smuggler would.",
      "As green card holders, the couple could be deported if they are convicted. They have five children who are U.S. citizens.",
      "The bakery closed for several days after their arrest, drawing about 20 people to protest on an uncharacteristically chilly evening.",
      "Monsignor Pedro Brisen\u0303o of St. Cecilia Church often visited before early morning Mass for the campechana, a flaky, crunchy pastry dough layered with caramelized sugar. His routine was interrupted when plainclothes immigration agents arrived in unmarked vehicles.",
      "\u201cA woman came here crying. She said, \u2018Father, Father, they\u2019re taking my brother,\u2019\u201d Brisen\u0303o said. The priest walked over and saw agents use zip ties to bind employees' hands.",
      "There is overwhelming bipartisan support to deport people who are in the U.S. illegally and have been convicted of a violent crime, with 82% in favor, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll in January. Support softens considerably for deportations of all people in the country illegally, with 43% in favor and 37% opposed.",
      "Trump and top aides repeatedly emphasize they are deporting criminals. But, as Homan often says, others in the country illegally who are there when officers arrest criminals also will be deported, a departure from the Biden administration's practices.",
      "So far, Trump has avoided the large-scale factory and office raids that characterized his first term and that of Republican President George W. Bush. Scattered reports of smaller operations included the recent arrests of 37 people at a roofing business in northern Washington state.",
      "ICE says it made 32,809 arrests in Trump's first 50 days in office, or a daily average of 656, which compared with a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period ending Sept. 30. ICE said nearly half (14,111) were convicted criminals and nearly one-third (9,980) had pending criminal charges but did not specify the charges.",
      "People with deep ties in their communities and no criminal records tend to generate more sympathy.",
      "Abby's reopened after the owners were released on bond.",
      "Chela and Alicia Vega, two sisters in their 60s who retired from the school district and have known the bakery owners for years, were among the customers filling trays with pastries. Chela Vega said the couple once took a week off from work to drive them to San Luis Potosi in Mexico after their sister died. When a hurricane struck, Leonardo Baez cut down their damaged trees without charge.",
      "For Terri Sponsler, 61, shopping at Abby\u2019s is now a political statement. \u201cWith everything going on right now in our country, we need to find ways to protest,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark W. Milum, the Los Fresnos city manager, said Abby\u2019s is an important business that contributes property and sales tax revenue to the $13 million annual municipal budget.",
      "Some customers just love the products.",
      "\u201cOther bakeries, they pop up, right?\" said Ruth Zamora, 65. \"But when you go there, it\u2019s not the same.\"",

      "Sending children back to school in new sneakers, jeans and T-shirts is likely to cost U.S. families significantly more this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- Sending children back to school in new sneakers, jeans and T-shirts is likely to cost U.S. families significantly more this fall if the bespoke tariffs President Donald Trump put on leading exporters take effect as planned, American industry groups warn.",
      "About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, the American Apparel & Footwear Association said, citing its most recent data. Walmart, Gap Inc., Lululemon and Nike are a few of the companies that have a majority of their clothing made in Asian countries.",
      "Those same garment-making hubs took a big hit under the president's plan to punish individual countries for trade imbalances. For all Chinese goods, that meant tariffs of at least 54%. He set the import tax rates for Vietnam and neighboring Cambodia at 46% and 49%, and products from Bangladesh and Indonesia at 37% and 32%.",
      "Working with foreign factories has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies in the fashion trade, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb new costs that high. India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka also got slapped with high tariffs so aren't immediate sourcing alternatives.",
      "\u201cIf these tariffs are allowed to persist, ultimately it\u2019s going to make its way to the consumer,\u201d said Steve Lamar, president and CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association.",
      "Another trade group, Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, provided estimates of the price increases that could be in store for shoes, noting 99% of the pairs sold in the U.S. are imports. Work boots made in China that now retail for $77 would go up to $115, while customers would pay $220 for running shoes made in Vietnam currently priced at $155, the group said.",
      "FDRA President Matt Priest predicted lower-income families and the places they shop would feel the impact most. He said a pair of Chinese-made children\u2019s shoes that cost $26 today will likely carry a $41 price tag by the back-to-school shopping season, according to his group\u2019s calculations.",
      "The tariffs on the top producers of not only finished fashion but many of the materials used to make footwear and apparel shocked U.S. retailers and brands. Before Trump's first term, U.S. companies had started to diversify away from China in response to trade tensions as well as human rights and environmental concerns.",
      "They accelerated the pace when he ordered tariffs on Chinese goods in 2018, shifting more production to other countries in Asia. Lululemon said in its latest annual filing that 40% of its sportswear last year was manufactured in Vietnam, 17% in Cambodia, 11% in Sri Lanka, 11% in Indonesia and 7% in Bangladesh.",
      "Nike, Levi-Strauss, Ralph Lauren, Gap. Inc., Abercrombie & Fitch and VF Corporation, which owns Vans, The North Face and Timberland, also reported a greatly reduced reliance on garment-makers and suppliers in China.",
      "Shoe brand Steve Madden said in November it would reduce imports from China by as much as 45% this year due to Trump's campaign pledge to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese products. The brand said it already had spent several years developing a factory network in Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil.",
      "Industry experts say reviving the American garment industry would be hugely expensive and take years if it were feasible. The number of people working in apparel manufacturing in January 2015 stood at 139,000 and had dwindled to 85,000 by January of this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lanka employs four times as many despite having a population less than one-seventh the size of the U.S.",
      "Along with lacking a skilled and willing workforce, the U.S. does not have domestic sources for the more than 70 materials that go into making a typical shoe, the Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America said in written comments to Trump's trade representative.",
      "Shoe companies would need to find or set up factories to make cotton laces, eyelets, textile uppers and other components to make finished footwear in the U.S. on a large scale, the group wrote.",
      "\u201cThese materials simply do not exist here, and many of these materials have never existed in the U.S,\u201d the organization said.",
      "The expected barrage of apparel price increases would follow three decades of stability. Clothes cost U.S. consumers essentially the same in 2024 as they did in 1994, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data.",
      "Economists and industry analysts have attributed the trend to free trade agreements, offshoring to foreign countries where workers are paid much less and heated competition for shoppers among discount retailers and fast-fashion brands like H&M, Zara and Forever 21.",
      "But customers unaccustomed to inflation in the apparel sector and coming off several years of steep rise in the costs of groceries and housing may be extra sensitive to any big jumps in clothing prices. Priest, of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said he has observed shoppers pulling back on buying shoes since Trump's return to the White House.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re nervous,\u201d he said. \"They\u2019ve obviously been playing the long game as it relates to inflation for a number of years now. And they just don\u2019t have the endurance to absorb higher prices, particularly as they\u2019re inflicted by the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "According to a report by British bank Barclays published Friday, the winners in the tariff wars are retailers that have at least one of these attributes: big negotiating power with their suppliers, a strong brand name and limited sourcing in Asia.",
      "In clothing and footwear, that includes off-price retailers Burlington, Ross Stores Inc. and TJX Companies, which operates T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, as well as Ralph Lauren and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, according to the report.",
      "The companies in for a tougher time are those with limited negotiating power, limited pricing power and high product exposure in Asia, a list including Gap Inc., Urban Outfitters and American Eagle Outfitters, according to the report.",
      "Secondhand clothing resale site ThredUp cheered a related action Trump took with his latest round of tariffs: eliminating a widely used tax exemption that has allowed millions of low-cost goods \u2014 most of them originating in China \u2014 to enter the U.S. every day duty-free.",
      "\u201cThis policy change will increase the cost of cheaply produced, disposable clothing imported from China, directly impacting the business model that fuels overproduction and environmental degradation,\u201d ThredUp said.",
      "Several industry analysts and economists said they think tariffs will end up being a consumer sales tax that widens the yawning gap between America's wealthiest residents and those in the middle and lower end of the income spectrum.",
      "\u201cSo where will the U.S. be buying its apparel now that the tariff rates on Bangladesh, Vietnam and China are astronomical?\u201d Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of the schedule set to take effect Wednesday. \u201cWill the new \u2018Golden Age\u2019 involve knitting our own knickers as well as snapping together our cellphones?\u201d",

      "About 45 years have passed since a state last eliminated its income tax on wages and salaries",
      "About 45 years have passed since a U.S. state last eliminated its income tax on wages and salaries. But with recent actions in Mississippi and Kentucky, two states now are on a path to do so, if their economies keep growing.",
      "The push to zero out the income tax is perhaps the most aggressive example of a tax-cutting trend that swept across states as they rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic with surging revenues and historic surpluses.",
      "But it comes during a time of greater uncertainty for states, as they wait to see whether President Donald Trump's cost cutting and tariffs lead to a reduction in federal funding for states and a downturn in the overall economy.",
      "Some fiscal analysts also warn the repeal of income taxes could leave states reliant on other levies, such as sales taxes, that disproportionately affect the poor.",
      "The 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to levy income taxes. It was ratified by states in 1913. Since then, most states have adopted their own income taxes.",
      "Eight states currently charge no personal income tax: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming. A ninth state, Washington, charges no personal income tax on wages and salaries but does tax certain capital gains income over $270,000.",
      "When Alaska repealed its personal income tax in 1980, it did so because state coffers were overflowing with billions of dollars in oil money.",
      "Though income tax eliminations have been proposed elsewhere, they have not been successful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to go without an individual income tax if you\u2019ve never levied one,\" said Katherine Loughead, a senior analyst and research manager at the nonprofit Tax Foundation. \"But once you become dependent on that revenue, it is a lot more difficult to phase out or eliminate that tax.\u201d",
      "Republican Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed a law gradually reducing the state's income tax rate from 4% to 3% by 2030 and setting state revenue growth benchmarks that could trigger additional incremental cuts until the tax is eliminated. The law also reduces the sales tax on groceries and raises the gasoline tax.",
      "If cash reserves are fully funded and revenue triggers are met each year, Mississippi's income tax could be gone by 2040.",
      "Supporters of an income tax repeal hope it will attract both businesses and residents, elevating the state\u2019s economy to the likes of Florida, Tennessee and Texas. Their theory is that when people pay less in income taxes, they will have more money to spend, thus boosting sales tax collections.",
      "The tax repeal \u201cputs us in a rare class of elite, competitive states,\u201d Reeves said in a statement. He added, \u201cMississippi has the potential to be a magnet for opportunity, for investment, for talent \u2013- and for families looking to build a better life.\u201d",
      "Mississippi is among the most impoverished states and relies heavily on federal funding. Democratic lawmakers warned the state could face a financial crises if cuts in federal funding come at the same time as state income tax reductions.",
      "The income tax provides \u201ca huge percentage of what the state brings in to fund things like schools and health care and services that everybody relies on,\u201d said Neva Butkus, senior analyst at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A 2022 Kentucky law reduced the state's income tax rate and set a series of revenue-based triggers that could gradually lower the tax to zero. But unlike in Mississippi, the triggers aren't automatic. Rather, the Kentucky General Assembly must approve each additional decrease in the tax rate.",
      "That has led to a series of tax-cutting measures, including two new laws this year. One implements the next tax rate reduction from 4% to 3.5% starting in 2026. The second makes it easier to continue cutting the tax rate in the future by allowing smaller incremental reductions if revenue growth isn't sufficient to trigger a 0.5 percentage point reduction.",
      "Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear signed the legislation for next year's tax cut but let the other measure passed by the Republican-led legislature become law without his signature. Beshear called it a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d bill, contending lawmakers had assured the guardrails for income tax reductions would remain in place while pushing for the 2026 tax cut, then later in the session altered the triggers for future years.",
      "New Hampshire and Tennessee already did not tax income from wages and salaries, but both states had taxed certain types of income.",
      "In 2021, Tennessee ended an income tax on interest from bonds and stock dividends that had been levied since 1929.",
      "New Hampshire halted its tax on interest and dividends at the start of this year.",
      "Some other states also are pushing to repeal income taxes The Oklahoma House passed legislation in March that would gradually cut the personal income tax rate to zero if revenue growth benchmarks are met. That bill now is in the Senate.",
      "New Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, also wants to phase out the income tax. The House and Senate have advanced legislation that would take an incremental step by exempting capital gains income from taxes.",

      "Both the agent and a lawyer recommended by the firm told them they did not need a mortgage offer until the \u00a3230,000 flat was near completion, the couple say.",

      "\"It was earth-shaking when we found out we should have got a mortgage offer then.\"",
      "After more than a year of building delays, the couple approached lenders and were shocked to find mortgage applications refused.",
      "Surveyors cited a range of reasons for devaluing the property, including the location and too many buy-to-let investments.",
      "Torsion Group, the developer, says it can't comment on the independently owned agent, but it \"expects them to operate at the highest professional standards\".",
      "\"The property was built to the finish specified and all the expected structural, safety and quality standards were delivered within the contractual period,\" a spokesperson says.",
      "\"We had really good credit scores, we had enough income to cover the payments, so it was very surprising to us when the mortgage was denied,\" Mr Marini says.",
      "\"I can't express how sad, stressful, demeaning even, it feels,\" says Mrs Marini, originally from Italy.",
      "When \"off-plan\" properties are sold it is \"common practice to wait until nearer the completion date before making a mortgage application\", says Mundy's Specialist Property Lawyers, one of the agent's recommended solicitors.",
      "\"The reason is that any mortgage offer issued prior to exchange of contracts would inevitably expire before the completion date and would have to be renewed.\"",
      "Patience Chinogureyi paid \u00a351,000 in fees, deposits and furniture packs on two Phoenix flats as buy-to-let investments.",
      "When exchanging contracts, she says she was told a mortgage offer was not needed at that stage, as long as she could finance the properties.",
      "Lenders later refused her applications, citing the same property valuation issues.",
      "\"I've not been able to sleep because it's all I ever think about,\" she says.",

      "Carolyn Barraclough successfully bought one of the flats, near the A61, for her son using money from an inheritance, but he never moved in due to building delays.",
      "\"The agent said she would hold the property for me for an hour, so I got a taxi down to the office,\" she recalls.",
      "\"I was told I would need to place a reservation fee immediately because somebody else had already been on the phone - if I left the building it was going to go to them and it was the last one.\"",
      "Ms Barraclough says she was never advised to have the flat valued and is worried she might not be able to sell.",
      "\"It was obvious that I was new to this type of thing, I've never purchased a property before for an investment other than the house I live in,\" she says.",
      "\"I didn't know any of the pitfalls.\"",
      "Offering advice on best practice, Sarah Cookson, director of Switalskis solicitors, says buyers should always gain a mortgage offer before exchanging contracts and paying a deposit - even when buying off-plan.",
      "\"It is very unusual not to advise a client to do this,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".",
      "Experts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.",
      "Read their answers below.",
      "How does a stock market index work?",
      "Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were.",
      "The stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.",
      "It works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon.",
      "The stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.",
      "Generally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.",
      "How does a market downturn affect pensions and daily life?",
      "Jack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same.",
      "Some people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.",
      "The other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you.",
      "There are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.",
      "Pensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game.",
      "The warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.",
      "A lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.",
      "How popular are tariffs in the US?",
      "There is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.",
      "According to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats.",
      "However, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment.",
      "One of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.",
      "Yet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax.",
      "There could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.",
      "How much of this is about China?",
      "Some think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.",
      "But Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods.",
      "The UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways.",
      "And while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.",
      "It is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.",
      "China is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain.",
      "There is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.",
      "Will the markets recover?",
      "That is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility.",
      "We got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam.",
      "The country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.",
      "Broadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed.",
      "We do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operation, sometime in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",
      "It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.",
      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",
      "\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

      "Amid market turmoil, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said the president should take three months to allow countries to renegotiate their trading relationships with the US.",
      "On Monday, Mr Ackman's warning was echoed by other prominent Wall Street figures, with JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon saying that Trump's tariffs risked pushing up prices for Americans.",

      "The rumour on Monday morning that Trump was considering a 90-day pause briefly lifted a swiftly sinking stock market after it was reported on financial network CNBC.",
      "The White House almost immediately shot down the report, showing Trump's commitment to his new import taxes. Stock prices largely stabilised afterward.",
      "The \"baseline\" tariffs of 10% on most countries' goods that Trump announced last week have already gone into effect, while the higher \"reciprocal\" rates he wants to impose on the \"worst offenders\" are expected later this week. Some countries are seeking to negotiate lower rates with the White House.",
      "The new tariffs, added to steep levies Trump has already put on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as all automobile imports, are worrying business and economic leaders that they will push up prices for American consumers and spark a global trade war.",
      "The head of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said on Monday that the tariffs will raise prices and possibly inflation, and contribute to an economic downturn, according to media reports.",
      "\"Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,\" Larry Fink, the firm's CEO, told a meeting of the Economic Club of New York.",
      "Goldman Sachs on Sunday said there is a 45% probability of the US entering a recession within the year, after estimating a 35% probability a week ago, before Trump unveiled his tariff plans at an event called \"Liberation Day\".",
      "Trump says the import taxes will boost his country with new jobs and investment.",
      "He defended them on Sunday, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".",
      "In his post on X on Sunday, Mr Ackman acknowledged the Trump argument that the global trade system had \"disadvantaged\" the US.",
      "But, he wrote, tariffs that Trump had imposed were \"massive and disproportionate\", and did not distinguish between American friends and enemies.",
      "Mr Ackman, the billionaire founder of Pershing Square hedge fund management company, became a high-profile supporter of Trump, a Republican, in July 2024.",
      "He had previously backed the rival Democratic Party, and his intervention was seen as an important electoral endorsement from the world of business.",

      "Numerous countries have vowed to respond, and China has already retaliated with new tariffs of its own on goods imported from the US. Trump on Monday threatened to  put an additional 50% tariff on goods from the country, which would bring the total taxes he intends to charge to more than 100%.",
      "Trump had launched an \"economic war against the whole world at once\" that risked shattering investor confidence in the US, Mr Ackman commented.",
      "Mr Ackman said the American leader now had \"an opportunity to call a 90-day time out, negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country\".",
      "His post on Sunday indicated that he felt the ball was back in Trump's court - after an earlier message on X which urged leaders of other countries to \"pick up the phone\" to make a deal with Trump.",

      "'I don't invest' - actually, you probably do",
      "Many people's initial reaction to \"the markets\" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money.",
      "Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments.",
      "Pension savers mostly let experts choose where to invest this money to help it grow. Widespread falls in share prices are likely to be bad news for pension savers.",
      "Hundreds of billions of pounds are held in defined contribution pensions at the moment.",
      "So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet.",
      "Experts say that investors have always had to ride economic shocks. Investments, by definition, require a long-term outlook and strategy. So, they are urging people not to panic in such circumstances or make knee-jerk decisions.",
      "Is my specific pension affected?",
      "Some people have a pension which promises a specific value, depending on their salary. Others have no pension at all.",
      "Millions of people have been automatically enrolled into a pension and may have not really noticed.",
      "This scheme sees employers divert wages into a pension and contribute some money themselves. The government adds a little in tax relief.",

      "As you approach retirement age, pension pots tend to be moved to less risky investments, such as government bonds. When stock markets fall, these bonds can do better.",
      "Anyone who has a pension pot invested and is taking an income from it will again see their investment go up and down with the stock markets.",

      "This is speculative and subject to change but these shifts in markets could bring lower rates for fixed-rate mortgage deals.",

      "At the moment, we just don't know.",
      "When we see big shifts in the stock markets there can also be fluctuations in the value of currencies and exchange rates.",
      "As a result, prices could go up, but could also go down.",
      "The value of the pound against the dollar dictates the cost to UK businesses importing goods and raw materials from abroad. If import costs go up or down this could be passed on in prices to consumers.",
      "Of course all of this depends on what happens with tariffs themselves. For more on how this could affect you, read here.",
      "Are stock market falls always bad?",
      "In purely investment terms, lower share prices can offer an opportunity to buy, in the hope that over the long term, they recover and rise. Many people will do this initially through a stocks and shares Individual Savings Account (Isa).",
      "Experts and regulators are at pains to point out that investments can go down as well as up, and urge people not to put everything into one investment, but to diversify.",
      "Some people invest money in what are known as tracker funds. These go up and down in line with the performance of a certain index, such as the FTSE 100.",
      "So if the index falls, so does the value of their investments and vice versa. One advantage of these funds is that they often cost relatively little to sign up to."

    "story": [
      "Lloyds Bank business customers and whistleblowers have accused it of failing small firms as it tried to reduce lending after the financial crash of 2008.",
      "Business owners who borrowed from Lloyds around that time have told the BBC their firms collapsed after the bank introduced them to its Business Support Unit (BSU), intended for clients it considered were struggling.",
      "A whistleblower told Panorama there was a \"pattern\" of \"pigeonholing\" small businesses as \"distressed\" when they were \"salvageable\".",
      "Lloyds said it \"categorically denied\" the allegations and its BSU \"supported many thousands of customers\".",
      "During the banking crisis of 2008, the government bailed out banks to save them from collapse, including Lloyds which got \u00a320bn of taxpayers' cash.",
      "Then Prime Minister Gordon Brown said as a condition of the bailout banks must protect lending to small and medium sized businesses.",
      "But over 15 years, the BBC has heard allegations that Lloyds' BSU failed small firms.",
      "James Ducker, who sold financial products to businesses for Lloyds in 2009, said \"the approach to lending became do not lend. Beyond that, get as much money back that we've lent as possible.\"",
      "He said customers in the BSU were \"easy pickings\".",
      "A whistleblower who worked for a consultancy firm brought in by Lloyds to advise small businesses in the BSU told BBC Panorama that in their experience the companies described by the bank as distressed \"probably weren't distressed, they were salvageable. I believe there was a pattern. There's no other way to put it.\"",
      "Wishing to remain anonymous, the whistleblower accused the bank of \"planning the administration of these entities in advance of reports that were produced. The business plan was completely ignored. They weren't interested in saving the company.\"",
      "Lloyds said: \"These historic allegations have been thoroughly investigated by the group and found to be unsubstantiated. They are categorically denied.\"",
      "'I'm going to bloody fight and fight'",
      "In 2009, Martin Woolls, a ferry boat captain from Weston-Super-Mare, had a residential mortgage with HSBC and unsecured loans with Lloyds.",
      "He had recently bought a new boat to expand his business, which he'd been running since 1981, and agreed to combine all his lending into a commercial mortgage and overdraft with Lloyds \u2013 both secured against his home.",
      "The overdraft was authorised at an initial rate of 2.75%. However, in the wake of the crash, the rates on Martin's overdraft surged to 16%. They peaked at 26.4% when he exceeded his overdraft limit. Bank of England base rates at the time remained static at 0.5%.",
      "\"Who the hell in the world can cope with those interest rates? Nobody. No business anywhere can cope with that. It's hideous,\" he said.",
      "Lloyds said Martin's rate rises were \"in accordance with the terms\" of his agreements and it doesn't accept they \"ultimately distressed\" his business \"or \"led to its collapse.\"",
      "By 2016, and with base rates still below 1%, Lloyds called in Martin's debts.",
      "His business went under, and the bank is still seeking repossession of his home, something Martin is fighting in court. He said the impact of securing the borrowing against his home wasn't properly explained to him.",
      "Lloyds said \"repossession is always a last resort\" but it is \"required in the interests of depositors and shareholders to protect its security when loans are defaulted upon\".",
      "It said numerous inquiries into Martin's case have found \"no evidence of wrongdoing\".",
      "Unwanted sale",
      "Keith Elliott borrowed \u00a38.6m from Lloyds in 2006 for his Yorkshire-based car auction business.",
      "An internal Lloyds email from July 2008 described Keith's business as \"profitable\" but struggling short term with cashflow issues as he redeveloped a new site.",
      "The bank suggested Keith take on a non-executive director from business consultants PwC. Keith agreed but the consultant though not appointed as a non-exec still advised him to re-organise the finances and apply for a further \u00a32m overdraft. And within a week, introduced Keith to the BSU.",
      "However, unbeknown to Keith, PwC was advising Lloyds to sell the business, even though it still belonged to Keith.",
      "In August 2008, a partner at PwC emailed Lloyds saying: \"looks like an accelerated sale with a big success fee/warrant for the bank to reflect the equity risk you are taking\".",
      "Keith told the BBC: \"The fact of the matter here - was their plan to steal my business behind my back. Yes or no? That's it. That's all we need to know.\"",
      "Keith didn't want to sell the business or let Lloyds take a stake, but by December the bank called in its loans and Keith's business collapsed, with PwC paid to oversee the breakup.",
      "His Leeds business was sold for around \u00a34m, despite being valued at \u00a313m just months earlier, with Lloyds taking a 15% stake.",
      "Lloyds said there was \"nothing deceitful or untoward in the introduction\" of PwC and that the consultants it worked with had a \"proven track record of saving and developing businesses.\"",
      "It said the BSU was not \"designed to generate profit\" and in some circumstances an equity stake may be taken with the agreement of customers \"to reflect the level of risk taken\".",
      "It added the insolvency caused it to lose \u00a35.5m and that Keith's personal spending was draining the company of money.",
      "PwC said: \"Mr Elliott's unsubstantiated allegations have been considered or investigated by multiple authorities, no finding of wrongdoing has been made against PwC or its personnel.\"",

      "Kashif suspects the BSU had never really been there to support him, describing it as \"an abattoir\".",
      "He turned to Avon and Somerset Police believing he was the victim of a financial crime. Police told him that a review found no evidence of criminality. However, he later discovered that Lloyds had been told he was going to meet with the police and that his case was going to be closed before the meeting had taken place. This was despite police telling him at that meeting that there would be a further review of his case.",

    "summary": "What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Apr 2025 07:15:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Workers are right to fear for their pensions, but the greater worry is the here and now - the economy they live in.",
    "story": [
      "The sharp fall in stock markets across the world shows no sign of letting up after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs and many are asking does this qualify as a stock market \"crash\" and what that could mean for them?",
      "The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.",
      "On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls.",
      "That was most definitely a crash.",
      "In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.",
      "By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.",
      "The UK FTSE index has fallen sharply though not by as much.",
      "This is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.",
      "A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.",
      "How does it affect you?",
      "While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.",
      "That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold.",
      "That is exactly what has happened here.",
      "Government bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.",
      "The closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.",
      "There have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment \u2013 and pension savings is a long term game.",
      "How might tariffs change the price of Nike's iconic trainers?",
      "Trump's agenda grapples with political and economic reality",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "So, does it matter?",
      "It does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.",
      "The markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.",
      "So the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.",
      "Falls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.",

      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the era of globalisation has \"ended\" following Donald Trump's new tariffs.",
      "It comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggested in a Sunday Telegraph article he was about to announce state intervention to protect UK firms from the US president's move.",
      "The UK was among nations hit with a 10% \"baseline\" import duty, and negotiations on a trade deal to reduce tariffs are continuing.",

      "The prime minister has said the government \"will do everything necessary to protect Britain's national interest\" and is \"ready to use industrial policy\" to help shelter businesses, because \"the world as we know it has gone\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Jones was asked whether globalisation - which has resulted in a boom in imports of cheap fashion, electrical goods and other products - was over.",
      "\"Yeah it's ended, the prime minister said that himself this morning,\" he said.",
      "\"Globalisation as we've known it for the last couple of decades has come to an end.\"",
      "The change meant the UK had to \"build out\" relationships with allies around the world but also invest in the UK's own economy, Jones said, denying ministers were \"scrabbling\" for solutions.",
      "He insisted the government was \"trying to get ahead of these challenges\", and that was why the government is \"investing in the NHS and skills as well as industrial policy\".",
      "Amid reports that elements of the spending review and the industrial strategy could be brought forward from their expected June publication date, Jones said Labour had been working on the industrial strategy since it was in opposition.",
      "Pressed on whether measures would be brought forward, Jones deferred to Sir Keir's announcement expected in the coming days and laughed when Kuenssberg said \"that sounds almost like a yes, but you're not allowed to say it to us this morning\".",
      "The UK government has continued its policy of not responding to US tariffs with counter-tariffs, as other countries have done - preferring, ministers have said, a \"calm\" approach focused on a UK-US trade deal.",
      "\"We're hoping to do a deal,\" Jones said, adding that \"we have a better outcome than other comparable countries as a consequence of our diplomacy\" on tariffs.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for MPs to be allowed to vote on any deal struck with Trump due to concerns about the possibility of changes to regulations around farming, online content and the digital services tax on US social media giants.",
      "The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it would be \"deeply undemocratic\" to sideline Parliament on these \"critical\" issues.",
      "She said: \"Both Conservative and Labour MPs should commit now to voting down any Trump deal that sells out British farmers and their high food standards or waters down our online safety rules.\"",
      "Asked to rule out watering down the Online Safety Act, Labour's Jones said protections for children are \"non-negotiable\" and committed to ensuring that social media platforms are \"designed in a way that protects children from harm\".",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said \"we won't undercut British farmers on welfare or environmental standards\" in order to secure a US trade deal.",
      "However, earlier this month, Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested the UK could change its taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal to overturn US tariffs, despite the digital services tax bringing in about \u00a3800m per year since its introduction in 2020.",
      "Speaking on the Kuenssberg programme, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that retaliatory tariffs were not a solution because they would only harm UK consumers.",
      "However, she said she did not agree that globalisation was over, insisting what was happening was only \"fragmentation\", adding \"we still have a great trading relationship with many other countries\".",
      "Badenoch added the Labour government should pick up the deal former Prime Minister Boris Johnson had tried to negotiate with Trump during his previous presidency, which ended in 2020.",
      "Johnson and his successor Liz Truss tried to push Trump's predecessor Joe Biden to open trade talks but negotiations petered out without a deal being struck.",
      "Rishi Sunak managed to agree the Atlantic Declaration with Biden, including commitments on easing trade barriers, closer defence industry ties, a data protection deal and more co-operation on AI.",
      "Asked whether a UK-US trade deal was indeed \"oven-ready\", as Badenoch has previously claimed several times, the Tory leader suggested the government should \"pick up where we left off\".",
      "She continued: \"We had six rounds of negotiations where there were some decisions that were concluded and they can pick that up and take it.",
      "\"The most important thing is removing tariffs -  the tariffs are going to be disruptive for our businesses... That is going to make a whole mess of the tax take that [Chancellor] Rachel Reeves thought she was going to be getting in her budget.",
      "\"We are in a worse place now because of the decisions that Labour has made and people out there are suffering.\"",

    "story": [
      "The UK exported nearly \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, making it one of the most important markets for thousands of British businesses.",
      "After President Donald Trump announced a 10% tariff on nearly all UK products, we spoke to businesses from some of Britain's biggest exporters to find out what it could mean for them.",
      "Food and drink: 'We've got fewer orders than normal'",
      "The UK food and drink industry exports a couple of billion pounds worth of goods to the US every year, satisfying Americans's taste for specialist products like smoked salmon, Scotch whisky and artisan cheeses.",
      "Adam Sopher, co-founder and chief executive at Joe & Seph's, the London-based luxury popcorn-maker, says the mere spectre of tariffs had already been affecting the business.",
      "US retailers usually place their orders for Christmas early in the year, but it's had far fewer orders than normal as retailers wait to see what happens.",
      "Joe & Seph's made \u00a38m in sales last year of which 2%-3% came from the US. \"So it is not huge,\" says Mr Sopher. \"But the US is the biggest popcorn market in the world so we had planned that a lot of our growth would come from there.\"",
      "As a consequence, he says, it's now planning to focus on growing its exports to the Middle East and Asia.",
      "However, the 10% tariff was not as bad as he was expecting and US importers aready have to pay a 5.8% tariff on Joe & Seph's goods when they reach American ports.",
      "\"So essentially what's happened is we're going to go from 5.8% to 10% as opposed to zero to 10%,\" says Mr Sopher. It is also lower than the new US tariffs levied on other countries, such as the 20% tax on the European Union.",
      "\"Ironically it could be a good thing,\" he says. \"These retailers who would have sourced from Europe might now say 'actually we'll buy more from the UK.\"",
      "Chemicals: 'We're hoping there is an opportunity'",
      "For something not visible to the naked eye, organic chemicals are a huge US export for the UK, totalling close to \u00a33bn last year.",
      "They are used across a massive range of industries from food to make-up to engines and into agriculture.",
      "Rather than feeling fearful about the US tariff, Robinsons Brothers reckons it may help the West Bromwich-based organic chemicals firm wrestle back American customers from cheaper overseas rivals.",
      "Chief executive Adrian Hanrahan says: \"We supplied a lot more to the US but China and India knocked us out of that because of very low pricing.\"",
      "Under Trump's new regime, China's imports face a 34% tariff while India's products will be taxed at 27%. Robinsons Brothers chemicals are already taxed at 6% when they reach the US",
      "Mr Hanrahan says he is still trying to nail down whether the new 10% US tariff on UK goods means Robinsons Brothers' American customers will be paying an additional 4% or a total 16%.",
      "\"Either way, it is a lot less than China or India will see going into the US,\" he says. \"So I am really hoping and seeing an opportunity for us here in one area.\"",
      "He says that since January, the company has been receiving more enquiries from the US, including two customers Robinsons Brothers lost five years ago \"at great expense\".",
      "At the moment, Robinsons Brothers derives between 1.5% and 2% of total sales - which reached \u00a324m last year - from America.",
      "This \"doesn't seem a lot\" says Mr Hanrahan but they are high margin products.",
      "There are, of course, concerns that rival countries may have to dump products once destined for the US on other markets, such as the UK which, in turn, could drive down domestic prices.",
      "Mr Hanrahan says: \"I am hoping that the UK government is preparing for that and putting something in place to mitigate any form of product dumping in the UK and in the EU.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump has granted TikTok a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires the hugely popular video app to either sell its US operation or face a ban in the country.",
      "\"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark',\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\" The platform is currently owned by Chinese company ByteDance.",
      "Trump's first extension was granted after he took office in January and was set to expire on Saturday.",
      "The social media platform, which says it has more than 170 million users in the US, must close in the US under a law passed by Congress - unless a buyer is found.",
      "In a statement on Friday, ByteDance said it had been in discussion with the Trump administration, but \"an agreement has not been executed\".",
      "\"There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Former US President Joe Biden's administration had argued that TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.",

      "Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.",

      "The unnamed source said the plan had been for Trump to sign an order initiating a 120-day period for closing the deal, allowing time to finish paperwork and secure financing.",
      "The agreement had won approval from existing investors, new investors, ByteDance, and the US government, but China backed out once Trump imposed the global import taxes, CBS reports.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington DC said in a statement that it \"opposed practices that violate the basic principles of the market economy\".",

      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",

      "This is a toughening of the government's stance as ministers seek to finalise a trade deal with the US.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds says he is consulting UK firms about the likely impact of the 10% tariffs being imposed on nearly all UK exports to the US and which products should be on the list.",

      "Explainer: What are tariffs, and why is Trump using them?",
      "Chris Mason: UK relief but not delight at Trump tariffs",
      "Trump told the BBC he believed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer \"was very happy on how we treated\" the UK on tariffs.",
      "He told reporters he was open to negotiations on the tariffs if countries offered \"something that is so phenomenal\".",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump claimed \"every country has called us\" since his announcement on Wednesday.",
      "\"That is the beauty of what we do, we put ourselves in the driver's seat.\"",
      "Earlier on Thursday, the UK government published a sample list of US goods that could face future tariffs.",
      "Being on the 417-page list does not necessarily mean a product will face tariffs, the government said.",
      "The list covers 27% of imports from the US - chosen because they would have a \"more limited impact\" on the UK economy, the Department for Business and Trade said.",
      "The products range from pure bred horses and children's clothes to crude oil, firearms and bourbon whiskey.",
      "Reynolds says talks are ongoing with the US government to secure an economic deal aimed at avoiding or reducing tariffs.",
      "But he warned that the UK \"reserves the right to take any action we deem necessary if a deal is not secured\".",
      "In the event of reaching a deal with the US, the consultation with businesses would be paused, he added.",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons, he said the fact the US had put lower tariffs on the UK compared to other countries \"vindicated the pragmatic approach the government has taken\".",
      "However, he said he was \"disappointed\" by the increase.",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith argued \"the government got no special favours\" - noting the UK was facing the same tariffs as the Congo and the Christmas Islands.",
      "The EU was being hit by 20% tariffs and the UK's lower rate of 10% was actually a vindication of those who \"were pilloried and abused\" for backing Brexit, Griffith argued.",

      "The UK exported almost \u00a360bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals.",
      "In addition to the 10% tariffs, a 25% tariff has been put on UK car exports, as well as steel and aluminium products.",

      "Insiders on the UK side say a deal is practically done. But no one knows if, or when, Trump will sign off on it.",
      "Any deal would be broader than just lower tariffs the BBC understands, focusing on technology, but also covering elements of trade in goods and services as well as agriculture - a controversial area in previous unsuccessful US-UK trade talks.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has suggested the UK could change its taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal to overturn US tariffs.",
      "The digital services tax, introduced in 2020, imposes a 2% levy on tech firms, including big US firms such as Amazon, bringing in about \u00a3800m in tax per year.",
      "Buy British to beat Trump tariffs, urge Lib Dems",
      "Scottish exporters 'disappointed' over Trump tariffs",
      "Both the government and business groups have largely backed a strategy of not provoking the Trump White House.",
      "But a big question remains whether President Trump's headline 10% universal tariff is even up for negotiation. Speaking to MPs Reynolds suggested it is, but White House officials have told the BBC the tariff is tied to a broader emergency measure that could take time to unwind.",
      "For the first time the government has announced a loose deadline for the negotiations - the business consultation on a response must wrap up on 1 May.",
      "If no deal is signed by then pressure will mount on the prime minister to strike back with retaliatory tariffs."

    "summary": "The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes.",
    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",
      "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",

      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",

      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",

      "When she sent her daughter to nursery, she \"never in a million years thought that anything like this would happen\", says Ms Wheeler.",
      "The couple have described as \"horrifying\", figures obtained by the BBC that show there were almost 20,000 reports of serious childcare incidents in England's nurseries in the past five years.",
      "That is an average of about 75 \"significant events\" reported to Ofsted each week - including incidents of serious injury or significant harm. There have even been rare cases involving deaths.",
      "The latest figures for serious incidents in the year 2023-24 are 40% higher than five years previously.",
      "Ofsted - which inspects England's education providers - says the rise may, in part, be due to its increased efforts to ensure nurseries report such events.",
      "Industry body, the Early Years Alliance, says most providers prioritise safety and that safeguarding breaches are extremely rare.",
      "Ms Wheeler and Mr Meehan are now calling for more frequent Ofsted inspections and for CCTV footage to be checked by inspectors.",
      "Genevieve had been at the now-closed Tiny Toes nursery in Stockport, Greater Manchester, for a week when she died.",
      "CCTV footage showed her struggling and coughing, but nursery worker Kate Roughley did not check on her properly until she was \"unresponsive and blue\", her trial heard. Roughley received a 14-year prison sentence for manslaughter in May last year.",
      "\"I couldn't understand how a baby of this age could go to sleep for a nap in the afternoon and then not wake up,\" Ms Wheeler told us.",
      "\"I completely lost who I was, that night in hospital, holding her.\"",
      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",
      "Ofsted's broad criteria for reporting can mean nursery workers \"err on the side of caution\", the Early Years Alliance says - meaning investigations often find no safeguarding breach has, in fact, occurred.",
      "But a childcare expert says the rise in the number of reports highlights a \"dire situation\".",
      "\"Standards [of care] are so low that the government surely has an obligation to improve them,\" says Helen Penn, professor of early childhood from the University of East London.",
      "Parents often rely on Ofsted's inspections and subsequent ratings to help them choose the best childcare setting.",
      "Full inspections usually happen every six years, but the regulator can inspect more often if a nursery is graded as inadequate or requiring improvement - or if concerns are raised.",
      "Schools rated good or outstanding are usually inspected every four years - and more frequently if graded lower.",
      "More than 1,500 nursery inspections had been brought forward after receiving reports of serious childcare incidents - Ofsted told us.",
      "But a former Ofsted inspector told us the regulator is not conducting enough inspections to identify poor practice and protect children.",

      "Details of organisations offering support with child bereavement are available at BBC Action Line",
      "The BBC has spoken to more than 20 former and current nursery workers, all from different premises across England, who said they had witnessed poor care.",
      "Many said frequent short-staffing was a factor in children being put at risk - and that Ofsted inspectors were not always able to spot this.",
      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",
      "The ex-Ofsted inspector says she witnessed workers man-handling children during inspections. \"If you can do that in front of someone, what are you planning on doing if nobody is watching?\" she adds.",
      "Misleading inspections is an \"appalling practice\", says Yvette Stanley, Ofsted's Head of Early Years and Social Care - adding that inspectors have to rely on the \"integrity of providers\".",

      "Rebecca Gregory was jailed for three years last September after being convicted of the wilful neglect and ill-treatment of children, including threatening and pushing babies younger than one.",
      "Ofsted inspectors do not routinely check CCTV footage - and the regulator says it cannot mandate CCTV use in nurseries.",

      "Ofsted says it is giving \"conspicuous care and monitoring\" to reports of harm to children.",
      "More frequent inspections may be a solution, says Ofsted's Yvette Stanley, but she says the regulator does not currently have the resources available to do this.",

      "VAT is now being added to private school fees after new rules came into force on 1 January.",
      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "But a legal challenge to the policy has been taken to the High Court, with some families and schools claiming it is discriminatory and in breach of human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",
      "About half of England's private schools are also charities, so receive an 80% reduction on business rates (taxes on properties used for commercial purposes).",
      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by three groups: the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argued that the policy goes against the legal right to an education.",
      "They also claim the policy is discriminatory, as those families attending low-paying faith schools, or with children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) who do not have an education, health and care plan (EHCP), say their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\".",
      "But the government said the main objective of the VAT policy is to raise additional tax revenue so they can raise standards for the 94% of children who attend state schools.",
      "Their lawyers argued that those who wish to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" are free to choose any private education for their child that they can afford, or to educate their child at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider whether it would amend the policy, but it would be under no obligation to do so.",
      "How will the extra money be spent?",
      "The removal of the VAT exemption is UK-wide, but each nation will decide how to spend the additional money received.",
      "The government estimates that the policy will raise an extra \u00a3460m in 2024/25, rising to \u00a31.7bn by 2029/30.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"every single penny\" will go to state schools.",
      "Labour has repeatedly pledged to use the money to recruit 6,500 new teachers for state schools in England.",
      "Schools have been struggling to attract and retain qualified teachers for years, especially in subject areas like maths and science.",
      "In October's Budget, the government allocated different sources of funding to address other issues in schools, like crumbling buildings and a stretched system for pupils with special educational needs.",
      "How much do private schools cost?",
      "Private schools - sometimes called independent schools - charge fees for most students.",
      "While some famous schools, like Eton and Harrow, charge about \u00a350,000 a year, the average is about \u00a315,000.",
      "There are about 2,500 private schools in the UK, educating about 7% of all pupils, including about 570,000 in England.",
      "Private schools have more freedom than government-funded state schools, and do not have to follow the national curriculum.",

      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Do 'many' private schools cost the same as a family holiday?",
      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",

      "The government says a grant to help cover boarding school fees for children of military families has also been increased to take account of rising charges.",
      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",

      "Named one of the greatest drummers of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, his energetic fills and melodic flourishes elevated UK number one hits like Call Me, The Tide Is High, Atomic and Heart Of Glass - with Burke deftly switching between punk, reggae, disco and hip-hop grooves.",
      "In a long and varied career, he also played with Iggy Pop, Bob Dylan, The Ramones, Eurythmics and Take That's Mark Owen.",
      "\"Clem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,\" his bandmates said in a tribute posted on Facebook.",
      "\"His talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable,\" wrote singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein.",
      "\"Beyond his musicianship, Clem was a source of inspiration both on and off the stage. His vibrant spirit, infectious enthusiasm and rock solid work ethic touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.\"",
      "Burke was born and raised in New Jersey, and said his earliest memory was \"playing my father's kit along to the Four Seasons\".",
      "He gained experience in marching bands and cover groups, before being recruited for Blondie in 1974.",
      "From the start, he envisioned his role as something more than a mere time-keeper.",
      "\"I always appreciated drummers like Hal Blaine (Phil Spector's go-to session drummer) and Earl Palmer (Little Richard, Fats Domino) who were consummate studio musicians, and had the kind of musicality and versatility that I aspired to,\" he told Mixdown magazine last year.",
      "\"I wanted to be able to contribute to the song rather than detract.\"",
      "The band made their name in New York punk clubs such as CBGB, alongside contemporaries such as Talking Heads, Television, and Patti Smith and released their self-titled debut album in 1976.",
      "However, it was 1978's Parallel Lines that made them household names, powered by new wave hits like One Way Or Another and the disco grooves of Heart of Glass.",
      "Recording the drum track for Heart Of Glass was a torturous experience, however.",
      "Producer Mike Chapman wanted to synchronise Burke's playing to a Roland drum machine - an experimental procedure that led to the drummer playing each of his drums individually, then piecing together the rhythm track over the period of a week.",
      "By the end of the session, \"he was ready to kill me,\" Chapman later told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "When Stein became critically ill in 1982, Blondie disbanded.",
      "Burke spent the intervening years playing with US rock band The Romantics, and worked with everyone from Pete Townshend and Joan Jett, to Sex Pistol Steve Jones and The Ramones - for whom he adopted the stage name Elvis Ramone.",
      "However, he returned to Blondie when they reformed in 1999, and scored his sixth UK number one single with the anthemic Maria.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in 2021, Harry said that having Burke back in the band meant their legacy wouldn't be diluted.",
      "\"I think a lot of times when bands get back together, they don't have enough of the original musicians,\" she said.",
      "\"With Chris and Clem and myself, we had that core, and it really weighed heavily, you know?\"",
      "The band have continued to perform and record ever since, and played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2023.",
      "Burke also became involved with a years-long study of the physical and psychological effects of drumming.",
      "That led to the establishment of the Clem Burke Drumming Project in 2008, whose detailed studies showed that drummers can reach the same physical exertion as professional athletes.",
      "As a result, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Gloucestershire in 2011.",
      "Burke made his last appearance with Blondie at Northern Ireland's Belsonic festival last summer, still wearing his CBGB t-shirt.",
      "\"His influence and contributions have spanned decades and genres, leaving an indelible mark on every project he was a part of,\" wrote Harry and Stein on Facebook.",
      "\"We extend our deepest condolences to Clem's family, friends, and fans around the world. His legacy will live on through the tremendous amount of music he created and the countless lives he touched.",

      "So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.",
      "Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.",
      "Inconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.",
      "It's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date.",
      "\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.",
      "\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\"",
      "He believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".",
      "\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.",
      "\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"",

      "Graham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.",
      "This City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.",
      "'Superb crime thriller'",
      "The Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".",
      "In a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".",

      "The show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".",
      "\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.",
      "Another reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"",

      "Beautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).",
      "\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.",
      "\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"",
      "He says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.",

      "Ms Hanna, who was charged with five counts of fraud, appeared before a district court on Saturday via video link. She was seen lying on a hospital bed, accompanied by an investigating officer, Singapore's Channel NewsAsia reported.",
      "She is accused of deceiving three men in Singapore and France into transferring money to her accounts, claiming the funds were needed as legal fees and for the opening of new bank accounts.",
      "Ms Hanna sought their sympathy by saying she was terminally ill and vouched to reimburse them through inheritance, claiming that she is part of the Brunei royal family. Her son questions these claims in the documentary.",
      "In exchange for their money, she also made promises to donate millions of dollars to a mosque and a Muslim non-profit organisation in Singapore, the court heard.",
      "It is unclear how much money her alleged victims lost, but Singapore police said preliminary investigations show she is involved in at least five cases of cheating with losses amounting to more than S$200,000 ($149,000; \u00a3115,400).",
      "If convicted, Ms Hanna faces up to 20 years in jail and a fine.",
      "Con Mum, which was released on Netflix on 25 March, follows Mr Hornigold's reunion with Ms Hanna in the UK during the pandemic.",
      "She presented herself as a wealthy, illegitimate daughter of the sultan of Brunei, initially showering Mr Hornigold, his then-partner Heather Kaniuk and his friends with lavish gifts, from cars to homes.",
      "Though initially sceptical, Mr Hornigold, who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants and founded Longboys Doughnuts, quickly developed a close relationship with his mother.",
      "Over time however, Ms Hanna began to leave Mr Hornigold and his friends to foot her escalating bills - Mr Hornigold said in the film that he lost \u00a3300,000 - while she disappeared.",
      "The film suggests that Ms Hanna had previously been convicted in the UK for shoplifting and fraud."

    "story": [
      "Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?",
      "Listen to Daniela read this article",
      "\"The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam.\" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.",
      "As an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.",
      "When I first spoke to her about this - long before \"Megxit\" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. \"Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?\" she told me.",
      "Seven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. \"As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.\"",
      "Only not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)",
      "Her recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either.",
      "Despite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).",
      "This was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, \u00a311 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of \u00a321.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters \u2014 with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.",
      "Now, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: \"I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities.\" But the question now is how will this be received.",
      "And, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative?",
      "Or could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?",
      "Five years on: Megxit's lingering impact",
      "It has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.",
      "As the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.",
      "The printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.",
      "It was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.",
      "Someone who attended the service that day described it to me as \"deeply uncomfortable\".",
      "The friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.",
      "According to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: \"Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.\"",
      "Mark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through \"the royal lens\". \"Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?\"",
      "There have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.",
      "One source who has worked with them described this as \"brave and idiotic\".",
      "With that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: \"She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.\"",
      "Much of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, \"is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family\", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. \"That connection shapes how everything she does is received.\"",
      "'An unerring instinct for getting it wrong'",
      "Early indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.",
      "Some critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an \"unerring instinct for getting it wrong\".",
      "On the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: \"Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.\"",
      "Other criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.",
      "\"High on gloss, low on human connection,\" said British Vogue. \"Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,\" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an \"exercise in narcissism\".",
      "Royal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. \"What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,\" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran.",
      "\"It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?\"",
      "And yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.",
      "And there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. \"Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,\" points out Mr Crawford.",
      "\"Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.\"",
      "The benefits of the Marmite effect",
      "With Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair.",
      "\"I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,\" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. \"A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.\"",
      "What's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to.",
      "Existing Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing.",
      "\"In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,\" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.",
      "The wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: \"You guys I'm scared for Meghan,\" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note.",
      "\"Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,\" the note reads. \"Don't be. This is the fun part \u2014 let's enjoy it.\"",
      "Likewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.",
      "In an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: \"I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever.\" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: \"Do you understand this?\" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.",
      "It was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.",
      "At home with the Sussexes",
      "Away from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.",
      "Meghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.",
      "When the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. \"Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,\" says Mr Vij.",
      "\"They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,\" he adds. \"They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.\"",
      "Yet for every positive story comes a negative one \u2013 with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.",
      "\"The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,\" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.",
      "More recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission.",
      "Insiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.",
      "But though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.",
      "'A spare to his wife'?",
      "The question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. \"They keep trying new things,\" argues Ms Peele. \"Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.\"",
      "Mr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.",
      "\"They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,\" he says. \"But you can only ride that train for so long\u2026 She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.\"",
      "However their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. \"Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?\"",
      "With a pause she adds: \"He's now a spare to his wife.\"",
      "And yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. \"It's never too late to turn things around,\" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals.",
      "\"But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.\"",
      "What that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)",
      "\"She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,\" argues Ms Peele. \"She has evolved.\" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.",
      "But Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals.",
      "\"While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.",
      "\"That's where they really have impact and stand out.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgvpp8n9ro",
    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:11:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The singer has won thousands of new fans on the Sabrina Carpenter tour, seven years into her career.",
    "story": [
      "When Rachel Chinouriri played London's O2 Arena last month, she cried.",
      "The new wave indie songwriter was there as the support act for Sabrina Carpenter, just a week after her first Brit Awards, where she was nominated for artist of the year.",
      "Seven years after her debut single, those milestones felt like a validation.",
      "No wonder she shed a tear.",
      "\"A lot of it was stress relief,\" says the 26-year-old, \"but I also felt strangely at home.",
      "\"I was just like, 'Wow, is this my life'.\"",
      "Chinouriri was booked for the tour after Carpenter fell in love with her song All I Ever Asked and started playing it as her walk-on music in the US.",
      "We speak on the 14th date, as she prepares to play Assago, Italy. By this point, she's having a blast \u2013 bounding across the catwalk every night, and dropping to her knees between songs to talk to the audience at eye level.",
      "But she admits the first couple of shows were \"slightly rough\".",
      "\"I filmed Graham Norton for the first time on Friday, then it was the Brit Awards on Saturday. The tour started in Dublin on Monday, and I had to film a music video on my day off.\"",
      "\"I was having a lot of first time experiences and trying to figure out what I was comfortable with on the road,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd say from show five, I was starting to enjoy myself.\"",
      "If there were nerves, they didn't show.",
      "The singer's infectious energy and knotty pop-rock songs have been picking up new fans in every city. One reviewer called her set \"the perfect sweet treat before the main feast\". At the end of March, she surpassed 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time. Adele sent her a bouquet of roses.",
      "Rachel Chinouriri is officially having a moment - but it hasn't come quickly.",
      "A former Brit School student, she released her first single, So My Darling, in 2018, and spent the next few years honing her sound.",
      "The 2019 EP Mama's Boy was a mellow blend of soulful pop, while 2021's Four\u00b0 In Winter was full of atmospheric electronic soundscapes.",
      "Underneath it all, though, Chinouriri was an indie kid. Raised in Croydon by strict Zimbabwean parents, she'd only been allowed to listen to Christian music at home. When they went out, the singer and her siblings would blast out hits by Coldplay, MIA, Lily Allen and Daughter.",
      "Once she incorporated those sounds to her music, Chinouriri's career took off. All I Ever Asked \u2013 a chirpy rock anthem that disguises a desperately sad story about being undervalued \u2013 won her support slots with Lewis Capaldi and Louis Tomlinson.",
      "Florence Pugh declared herself a fan, and ended up starring in the video for Never Need Me, a killer kiss-off to a boyfriend who left her dangling.",
      "For a musician who'd suffered crippling anxiety as a teenager (\"I was pulling my hair out, and having panic attacks\") the success was entirely unexpected.",
      "\"British culture is quite self-deprecating,\" she says, \"so when I was younger, I just didn't believe I could do these things.",
      "\"Even the fact I can say I'm a two-time Brit nominee is still quite surreal. Then I'm like, Why is it surreal?",
      "\"I do deserve it because I've been making music since I was 16, and I haven't stopped'.\"",
      "Chinouriri's debut album, the noughties-flavoured What A Devastating Turn Of Events, was finally released last May.",
      "Initially charting at number 17, it has continued to sell steadily, thanks to the continued popularity of All I Ever Asked on TiKTok, as well as Chinouriri's scene-stealing festival performances.",
      "Reflecting on her rise, she says there is a \"privilege to having a slow-paced career\".",
      "\"I've seen what happens when you skyrocket or go viral. If I'd a massive hit song when I was 21, I wouldn't have been ready in any way, shape or form \u2013 mentally or professionally. I'd be panicking.",
      "\"So now that things are skyrocketing, I just need to remember that what I'm good at is writing how I feel and turning those feelings into music.",
      "\"And even though there's more opinions about what I'm doing now, I need to trust my gut.\"",
      "Unexpected love affair",
      "What A Devastating Turn Of Events was a huge emotional purge. Among the topics she discussed: Racism, school bullying, self-harm, alcoholism, alienation and toxic relationships.",
      "A recurring theme was men who take more from a relationship than they put back in.",
      "\"I'm quite a caregiver by nature, and that attracts boys who need a lot of help, or are very insecure,\" the singer reflects.",
      "\"I tend to be the person's 'mother', which isn't fun, because I have to be the strong one and there's no room for my emotions.\"",
      "But the days of heartbreak are over. Last year, the singer unexpectedly found herself in a new kind of relationship, one where her needs are as important as her partner's.",
      "It's written all over her new EP, Little House. \"Kissing me under the indigo / I begged for the morning sun not to rise / Oh, what a beautiful starry night,\" she sings, totally besotted, on the ballad Indigo.",
      "The lead single, Can We Talk About Isaac, even uses her new partner's real name. His photo is on the artwork.",
      "\"It's quite a brave move,\" she laughs, \"but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I don't want to lose being able to document my life in song.",
      "\"It's a risk that whoever wants to date me was going to have to take!\"",
      "The title track documents their chance meeting at a pub: \"With two pints in his hands, he came over and said, 'Nice to meet you'.\"",
      "\"He's very sweet, he's got a very simple friendship group, he likes going to the pub \u2013 but he does so much for me. It's the first experience I've ever had of being taken care of.",
      "\"He's changed my life, no matter what happens between us. We're both just really in love with each other and having a having a blast.\"",
      "At the moment, though, the couple have been forced apart. The Sabrina Carpenter tour lasts five weeks, after which Chinouriri sets off for her first headline tour of North America.",
      "It comes six months after the singer had to pull out of a US support slot with alt-pop star Remi Wolf.",
      "She says the dates would have left her penniless, even with financial support from her record label.",
      "\"As much as I would have loved that tour, I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent, which was very, very scary,\" she says.",
      "\"My fans were like, 'Let's help out. Let's do a GoFundMe for 10 grand', but it was far beyond 10 grand.",
      "\"It was like, who's going to pay for visas, where's your band going to sleep, what are people going to eat?",
      "\"It was a big wake up call. It made me reassess; do I need to be styled all the time? Do I need to travel this way all the time?",
      "\"So now, I'm able to go back now in full force and upgrade my venues and sell out almost the entire tour, which is mental.\"",
      "The cancellation taught her to slow down instead of grabbing every opportunity she's offered.",
      "It's a sign that Chinouriri is finally shedding the self-doubt that clouded her early career.",
      "The success of the Sabrina Carpenter tour is a prime example.",
      "\"There's always a risk as an opener, that people might be completely uninterested, but this has been the complete opposite,\" she says.",
      "\"Having the entire arena sing songs with you is such a blessed feeling to have.\"",
      "It won't be long before she's selling out those arenas on her own."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy73nx46y3o",
    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:18:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Two homeowners had very different experiences when the elusive artist chose their walls for his work.",
    "story": [
      "Sam was lying in bed one morning when her tenant in a house she owned in Margate sent her a photo of a piece of graffiti that had appeared on the wall outside.",
      "Astonishingly, it looked like a Banksy. It would turn out to be perhaps the graffiti artist's most interesting new artwork of recent years,\u202fValentine's Day Mascara (pictured above), which was revealed in Margate on Valentine's Day, 2023.",
      "Bamboozled, Sam googled: what do you do when you wake up with a Banksy on your wall?",
      "\"What did Google say about that?\" I asked her.",
      "\"Nothing! And I was like, I need to contact the council, I need to find an art gallery who can advise me.\"",
      "Sam called Julian Usher at Red Eight Gallery. Julian's team, conscious that new Banksys are under immediate threat from street cleaners, the weather, rival graffiti artists and other art dealers, promised he'd be in Margate within the hour: \"We knew we had to get the piece covered,\" say Julian.",
      "And there was another reason Julian got to Margate double-quick: if Banksy chooses your wall for one of his drawings, you could be seriously in the money.",
      "For the second season of my BBC Radio 4 podcast The Banksy Story, which is called When Banksy Comes To Town, I've been following the very different fates of two sets of homeowners who wake up one day to find a Banksy on their wall. The season shows just how important his graffiti becomes for a local community \u2013 and why people disagree so vehemently about what should happen after it's discovered.",
      "Sam became the custodian of\u202fValentine's Day Mascara, which speaks to the theme of domestic violence, incidents of which usually spike each Valentine's Day. It's a complicated bit of work. A peppy 50s housewife with a black eye has bludgeoned her partner. A real pan with flecks of red is at her feet, and his painted legs are upended into the real fridge-freezer that Banksy left by the wall. A broken plastic chair testifies to the fight they have had.",
      "Later on the day it appeared, refuse collectors arrived to spirit away the fridge-freezer. This precipitated a free-for-all, with the public helping themselves to the remnants. It was mayhem.",
      "A media scrum, a wrong-footed local council, millions of global onlookers. Exactly, one suspects, what Banksy wanted.",
      "And this time, just for laughs, he left behind oil painter Peter Brown, commissioned to capture the scenes he would miss. I spoke to Pete \"The Street\" Brown for my series. \"The whole reason I was employed was because Banksy was questioning what was the art about,\" Pete explained. \"Is it about the graffiti? Or is it about the reaction afterwards, and what happens to it?\"",
      "As luck would have it, Pete was captured on video just as Banksy's team were putting the finishing touches to Valentine's Day Mascara \u2013 a video that The Banksy Story managed to obtain. In it we can see that one of Banksy's team let a local kid play with their drone.",
      "\"They're in the process of putting a large piece on a wall and yet they're taking the time to teach a kid how to fly a drone,\" says Steph Warren, who used to work with Banksy and who appeared in my first series - about the artist's rise and rise. \"Very sweet!\"",
      "Alongside Sam, I've been following the story of Gert and Gary. They, like Sam, did not want me to use their last name. A 30ft-high seagull appeared one morning on the wall of their buy-to-let in Lowestoft in Suffolk. The bird needed to be massive for Banksy's ambitious visual gag to work. The artist had shoved large yellow insulation strips into a skip that now looked like a fast-food container that the seagull divebombed to steal chips.",
      "Banksy had chosen his wall well. Visitors arriving by train were treated to this witty meditation on the scourge of Britain's seaside towns, equal parts warning and celebration. The\u202fLowestoft Seagull\u202fwas part of Banksy's\u202fGreat British Staycation, his post-Covid lockdown campaign to cheer us all up at the prospect of a summer holiday spent in the UK.",
      "But Gert was not cheered-up at all. \"It's not a seagull, it's an albatross!\" she quipped when I went to interview her.",
      "\"How did you know it was a Banksy?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was scaffolding erected on the side of the house. I tried to find out if it was a particular scaffolding firm, but there was no phone number,\" Gert replied. \"On the Monday morning the letting agency informed me that I could possibly have a Banksy. By then the scaffolding had gone and this seagull appeared.\"",
      "This fits with what we know of Banksy's modus operandi. He claims hiding in plain sight is the best way to remain invisible. \"If questioned about your legitimacy,\" he wrote in his book Wall & Piece, \"simply complain about the hourly rate.\"",
      "What do we know about Banksy?",
      "Nine days of Banksy, but what do the works mean?",
      "It's a good gag. But how fun is it for the folk on the other end of his spray can?",
      "I found that with good hustling skills a Banksied homeowner might see their bank balance expanded, but it's not an easy process.",
      "As Gert explains, exasperated, \"Lowestoft people commented that it belongs to Lowestoft\u2026 But nobody's turned up to say, 'we'll help you protect it'. It doesn't belong to the person filming it, or the person taking pictures with their children. The problem is mine!\"",
      "Gert had to contend with people putting their children into the skip for photo opportunities, the council trying to charge her for Perspex screens, and the threat of a Preservation Order which might have cost her \u00a340,000 a year.",
      "And the two stories I've been following have ended up having entirely different outcomes.",
      "Both artworks have been taken off the houses they were painted on \u2013 a complex, expensive operation that uses specialist equipment \u2013 so they can be sold. But while the Banksy in Margate is now on the verge of selling for well over \u00a31m, with a sizeable chunk set to go to a domestic violence charity, and with the piece remaining in the town for the foreseeable future, the Banksy up the coast in Lowestoft languishes in a climate-controlled warehouse, costing its owners \u00a33,000 per month.",
      "It has cost Gert and her partner Gary around \u00a3450,000 so far to preserve the piece and although there are buyers sniffing around, nobody has bought it yet. Speaking about the situation, Gary told me: \"I'm so angry at what's going on.\"",
      "Not everyone approves of people trying to sell Banksy's street art.",
      "Steph Warren \u2013 who starred in the first series of The Banksy Story\u202fas the only person ever to work for Banksy without signing his non-disclosure agreement \u2013 suggests that worried homeowners should simply \"get busy with five litres of white emulsion and paint it out\".",
      "Owner of street-art gallery Stelladore in St Leonards, Warren is a purist, who feels that art made for the street should remain there, no matter its value. \"With Banksy, where he puts the art is fundamental,\" she says. \"Remove the work from the precise place on the streets that he put it, and the work instantly loses its power. Context is everything.\"",
      "But Banksy has elevated graffiti into a new art form, now monetised \u2013 street art. Banksy's signed prints can sell for six-figure sums. Graffiti, or street art, has not just come of age, it is now an asset class. Given this, how can any homeowner feel okay about scrubbing away a Banksy without feeling as if they have smashed a Ming vase?",
      "One thing I know for sure: if you wake up with a Banksy on your wall, you'll have to make a series of clever decisions to come out of it unscathed. As Sam says, after two years of dealing with the Banksy circus, \"going back to normal life now is going to be terribly boring\".",

    "summary": "Sir Sam Mendes' forthcoming Beatles biopics have cast four modern-day heartthrobs - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The Fab Four came together on stage this week for an all-star Beatles announcement that left some of the internet swooning.",
      "No, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr aren't reuniting through AI for a joint album with Taylor Swift.",
      "Instead, the 60s rock 'n' roll icons will be played by four leading heartthrobs of the moment: Paul Mescal (McCartney), Harris Dickinson (Lennon), Joseph Quinn (Harrison) and Barry Keoghan (Starr), in a big-screen quadrilogy directed by Sir Sam Mendes - all set for release in 2028.",
      "Each actor fits the mould of \"the internet's boyfriends\" - a term defined by Glamour magazine as \"a famous or semi-famous male person whom your entire Twitter feed has a crush on at the same time\".",
      "When Sir Sam walked out on stage with his \"band\" at Las Vegas' CinemaCon on Tuesday, the message was clear.",
      "If 1960s Beatlemania was defined by teenage girls fainting and screaming, the plan now is arguably to get Gen Z - in internet parlance  - \"screaming, crying, throwing up\" from behind their phone screens in excitement.",
      "\"Each star brings their own brand of modern-day hysteria,\" says The Standard's celebrity correspondent Lisa McLoughlin, \"the kind fuelled by social media virality and fan video edits\".",
      "This is particularly true of Mescal, whose \"popularity mirrors a smidge the frenzy the Beatles once sparked\".",
      "After shooting to fame in 2020's BBC adaptation of Normal People, the Irishman scored an Oscar nomination as a tormented father in Aftersun, before finding blockbuster status in Gladiator II - rising from indie heartbreaker to Hollywood heartthrob.",
      "Similar is true of fellow Irishman Keoghan. Also Oscar-nominated for Banshees of Inisherin, he embraced rugged sex symbol status in last year's cult hit Saltburn.",
      "Dickinson and Quinn are earlier in their trajectory, but still burning bright - the former recently starring alongside Nicole Kidman in erotic thriller Babygirl and the latter turning heads in Netflix's Stranger Things.",
      "McLoughlin describes the casting as \"logical and predictable\" - a strategic move as the band look to secure their legacy with a new generation, while studios grapple with the ambition of luring streaming era, post-Covid, audiences back to the cinema not once, but four times in close proximity.",
      "A day in the life?",
      "The timing and scope of the project sums up the Beatles' unique heritage as the best-selling band of all-time - the catalyst for shifting youth culture and the boundaries of pop.",
      "It's been 56 years since all four members last recorded together. Lennon was shot dead just over a decade later at 40, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001, aged 58. The two surviving Beatles, Sir Paul and Sir Ringo, are now into their 80s.",
      "And yet, as the band's only official biographer Hunter Davies told Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: \"The strange thing about the Beatles is that the longer we get from them, the bigger they become\".",
      "Recent years have seen Sir Paul seemingly work to bookend the Beatles' music - becoming Glastonbury's oldest ever headliner at 80, before driving the 2023 release of Now and Then, a \"final\" Beatles track rebuilt from Lennon's demo vocals. It became the band's 18th UK number one single, over five decades from their last, and won a Grammy.",
      "The forthcoming biopics appear to be a way of continuing this on the big screen.",
      "Four years on from Peter Jackson's sprawling Get Back docuseries, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.",
      "The casting reflects the distinct identities and histories of the members, each offering something different to lovelorn girls and copycat boys so intoxicated by Beatlemania.",
      "McLoughlin feels the choices \"make commercial sense\" as the perfect foil for an audience now two generations removed from the original Beatlemania.",
      "\"They all have dedicated younger fan bases (many of whom may not be regular cinema-goers or deeply connected to the Beatles), acting credibility and experience leading or co-leading major productions\".",
      "Each film will focus on an individual member of the band. \"They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not,\" Sir Sam explained.",
      "\"They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.\"",
      "'Binge cinema'",
      "The Barbenheimer phenomenon of summer 2023 highlighted the increasing influence online audience reactions hold on cultural currency.",
      "It also turbocharged Hollywood's acceptance of \"event cinema\" as a way to lure younger audiences. A generation that Warner Bros Discovery's executive director Vera Chien previously told Forbes, already see the streaming-social media relationship as the norm.",
      "Sir Sam's four-film schedule plays into this. It's aimed at creating what Sony executive Tom Rothman described as \"the first bingeable theatrical experience\".",
      "\"Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house,\" Sir Sam said.",
      "Films can now develop distinct digital identities through audience projection, as seen by the viral success of Saltburn.",
      "The makers of the Beatles biopics are arguably betting on its cast of \"internet boyfriends\" pulling younger audiences - without the same nostalgic attachment to the Beatles - engaged on social media and, executives hope, looking up from phone screen to big screen.",
      "The extent to which musical performances will feature is unknown.",
      "But the Beatle biopics could capitalise on the booming money-spinning genre that's found awards success over the past decade. .",
      "It's also proven fertile heartthrob ground, with the Beatles cast following Jacob Elordi and Austin Butler's turns as Elvis, alongside Timothee Chalamet's Oscar-nominated take as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.",
      "Still, there are risks, says Dade Hayes, business writer at Deadline and co-author of Binge Times.",
      "He says that whilst he commends Rothman's \"clever handle\" and the cinephile in him values the biopics' \"bold statement about the value of cinemas and communal viewing,\" market realities present cautionary signs.",
      "First, the UK box office is yet to fully bounce back from the pandemic, whilst US takings are more than 20% below pre-Covid levels. \"If people aren't dying to return at regular intervals to cinemas,\" says Hayes, \"then you are holding an expensive set of assets that are hard to monetise\".",
      "And a multi-release strategy relies on the \"fuse being lit with the first instalment\", Hayes says.",
      "He points to Kevin Costner's Horizon films, originally envisioned as a multi-part theatrical franchise, only to flounder once the first instalment tanked, as an example of the dangers.",
      "For McLoughlin, the three-year gap between the casting announcement and 2028 release date adds further risk, especially in the fast-moving online space where fanbases can shift.",
      "Liverpool walking alone",
      "But beyond industry dynamics there's also a cast talking point much closer to home.",
      "The Beatles biopics, celebrating four Scouse lads who conquered the world and put Liverpool on the map, will not feature any local talent in the lead roles.",
      "As one Liverpudlian put it in a TikTok video liked over 200,000 times: \"I love Mescal as much as the next gal but [the lack of representation] is breaking my heart\".",
      "McLoughlin agrees, pointing out that James Corden last week urged the TV industry to be \"bolder\" and back ideas that \"might scare you a little.\" She feels film studios should do the same.",
      "\"The Beatles themselves were unknown until they weren't,\" she says. \"This could have been a chance for a newcomer to have their own Beatles moment - rising from obscurity in real-time\".",
      "And perhaps the biggest missed opportunity of all McLoughlin adds, is the failure to put Liverpudlian actors front and centre in a Beatles biopic. \"The band is Liverpool's greatest cultural export, yet the city's deep talent pool was completely overlooked,\" she adds.",
      "Social media, meanwhile, is already awash with doubt over Keoghan's ability to deliver a consistent Scouse accent, questioning his attempts in Saltburn.",
      "Still, as Hunter Davies put it, the Beatles have long been more than just a local band. They keep growing.",
      "Way back in 1966, Lennon infamously described them as bigger than Jesus. Over five decades on, the studio behind the four films - and perhaps cinema in general - is no doubt banking on a Beatlemania revival."

    "story": [
      "Val Kilmer is joking around in his trailer on the set of Top Gun, pretending to bark demands into a packet of More cigarettes as if it's a phone and he's talking to the studio boss.",
      "\"He wants more! More sex! More drugs! More wine! More tobacco! More headaches! More ulcers! More herpes! More women! And less of Tom Cruise!\"",
      "Co-stars Rick Rossovich and Barry Tubb, also on a break from playing the film's elite fighter pilots, are in the trailer too, cracking up with laughter.",
      "Rossovich, aka Kilmer's on-screen partner Slider, is apparently the person who wants \"more\". Wearing shades but no shirt, he proceeds to pretend to throw a chair at Kilmer's head, before jumping out of the trailer into the sunshine and dancing off.",
      "Kilmer took his video camera everywhere to film behind the scenes, and picked these snapshots of the carefree tomfoolery on the Top Gun set in 1985 as the opening shots for a 2021 documentary about his life.",
      "\"He had the first video camera I'd ever seen,\" recalls Tubb, who played Wolfman. \"They got so tired of telling him to turn it off on the set of Top Gun that they finally just let it go.",
      "\"We had a fun time with it because we tried to catch everyone on the toilet with the video camera. That was our goofing around. So there's video somewhere of everyone with the door open on the toilet. We were goofballs.\"",
      "He adds: \"Cruise never hung out with us. It was all of us, except for Cruise. He was method acting as the loner, and we were all at this beach hotel, riding motorcycles down hallways and things.\"",
      "And Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, \"unlike some producers, threw parties every other night\", he says. \"And so it was definitely in the air.\"",
      "'Young and bulletproof'",
      "Tubb is one of many former co-stars who have been fondly remembering Kilmer's acting and his antics, following his death at the age of 65.",
      "\"He was the coolest cat I've ever met,\" Tubb tells BBC News. \"Not only did he have great acting chops, but he was funny as hell.\"",
      "Top Gun was a breakthrough for Kilmer, who played Iceman, the rival to Cruise's hotshot Maverick at the US Navy's academy for elite fighter pilots.",
      "On screen, saving the USA from Soviet MiG jets was serious business. Off screen, filming in California and Nevada, things were less serious.",
      "\"As Sean Penn once said, working in Hollywood is like being in high school with money,\" Tubb says.",
      "\"I was 22 years old, and I was the younger of the bunch.",
      "\"We had a deal that if one of us wanted to go to Mexico, all of us had to go. And Val had his van from high school, so we would all pile into Val's van and go over to Mexico for dinner.",
      "\"We were young and bulletproof.\"",

      "Look back at Val Kilmer's best-known roles",
      "Tubb whispered one of the film's famous lines when the class watched a video of aerial dogfights: \"This gives me a hard-on.\"",
      "That came about after he played a practical joke by switching the real tape in the academy's VHS player for a pornographic video.",
      "\"[Director] Tony Scott heard me say that and he said, 'Keep that in'. We were doing things like that. We were cutting up and having fun the whole time.\"",
      "'Play up the rivalry with Tom'",
      "Kilmer originally didn't want to appear in the film, saying he throught the script was silly and he disliked its warmongering.",
      "To the audition, he \"wore oversize gonky Australian shorts in nausea green\" in an attempt to put the producers off, he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "\"I read the lines indifferently. And yet, amazingly, I was told I had the part.\"",
      "The script contained \"very little\" substance to Iceman's character, he said in his documentary.",
      "\"So I attempted to make him real. I manifested a backstory for him, where he had a father who ignored him, and as a result, was driven by the need to be perfect in every way. This obsession with perfection is what made him so arrogant.\"",
      "He added that he would \"purposely play up the rivalry between Tom's character and mine off screen\" as well as on.",
      "\"What ended up happening is the actors, in true method fashion, split into two distinct camps.",
      "\"You had Maverick and Goose on one side, and Slider, Hollywood, Wolfman and me, Iceman, on the other.",
      "\"It was fun to play up the conflict between our characters, but in reality I've always thought of Tom as a friend, and we've always supported each other.\"",
      "By the time a sequel was finally shot in 2018 and 2019, Kilmer had suffered from throat cancer. He had a tracheotomy operation, affecting his voice and making it difficult to speak.",
      "But Cruise was the one who insisted Iceman should return. The pair shared a highly emotional scene as Kilmer's character, now an admiral, typed out part of his side of the conversation on a screen, before sharing a hug.",
      "\"Cruise couldn't have been cooler,\" Kilmer said. \"Tom and I took up where we left off. The reunion felt great.\"",
      "Many of the cast had remained friends after the original film, Tubb says, and Rossovich's home in the Hollywood Hills became the \"Top Gun club house\".",
      "\"I remember going to Rick's house and they were painting Rick's kitchen, and Val got up on top of the refrigerator and did 20 minutes of Hamlet. Never missed a word.\"",
      "Kilmer was \"an actors' actor\", who raised the bar for the rest of the cast, Tubb says.",
      "\"He had a level of artistry that transcended the Hollywood norm.",
      "\"Val was a cool cat. Also, he could back it up. I remember seeing The Doors movie and I just saw Jim Morrison.",
      "\"His ability to disappear into characters was incredible. Same with Iceman.\"",
      "He adds: \"Val, among his peers, was well loved. He came fully loaded.\"",
      "The love for Kilmer has shone through in the tributes from his fellow actors.",
      "Kelly McGillis, who played Cruise's love interest Charlie and starred with Kilmer in 1999's At First Sight, told the BBC in a statement: \"I need some time to process what Val has meant in my walk here on Earth.",
      "\"He was an enigmatic presence sprinkled here & there throughout my journey. A force with depth & weight which will take some time to sort out.",
      "\"There are just so many feelings at the moment.",
      "\"Gratitude being the first.\"",
      "Cheeseburgers on set",
      "English actor and dancer Will Kemp, who appeared alongside Kilmer in the 2004 slasher film Mindhunters, said the news of his death came as a \"real shock\".",
      "He recalls how the star had set him at ease and made him laugh with his \"wicked sense of humour\" when he was a nervous young actor on his first production.",
      "\"I entered into it with sort of trepidation really because I had heard all sorts of rumours about possible bad behaviour on set, and also he's this acting legend that I'd grown up with.",
      "\"But Val was really sweet, fun, generous, but really, really unpredictable!\"",
      "His memories of his first ever big scene will forever be tied up with Kilmer.",
      "\"I have a very clear memory of the first scene that I shot that was in a helicopter, and we're flying around with [director] Renny Harlin shouting, 'why are we not shooting?'",
      "\"We're halfway through take one, and Val - totally unscripted - somehow pulls out a cheeseburger and was just casually munching on it.",
      "\"He turns over to me and goes, 'hey, is everybody having fun?'",
      "\"It just blew my mind.\"",
      "Kemp, also known for his portrayal of the Swan in Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake, admitted Kilmer's acting methods on set sometimes appeared to be \"crazy\" while at other times there were \"moments of absolute genius\".",

    "story": [
      "After a pair of low-key, introspective albums, Ed Sheeran has returned to his roots with a shimmering new pop single, Azizam.",
      "The track sees the star incorporate Middle Eastern influences, inspired by producer Illya Salmanzadeh's Persian heritage.",
      "The title means \"my dear\" or \"my darling\" in Farsi, and the track incorporates instruments like the ghatam, a clay pot commonly used as percussion in Southern India, and the santur, a hammered dulcimer of Iranian origin.",
      "\"Now the song's finished, and it's out, I'm discovering more and more every single day that Persians are really, really proud of their culture, and it's great to celebrate it,\" Sheeran told BBC Radio 1.",
      "Azizam is released in a crowded week for new music, with comeback songs by Miley Cyrus, Wet Leg and Elton John all vying for streams.",
      "Sheeran's track doesn't stray too far from his usual pop template, but the Persian influences will undoubtedly bolster his figures in the Middle East - the world's fastest-growing music market.",
      "It's a trick the star has pulled before.",
      "A voracious music fan with an instinct for new commercial opportunities, he's collaborated with Afrobeats stars like Burna Boy and Fireboy DML, learned Spanish for a record with Colombian singer J Balvin, tipped his hat to Irish folk music on Galway Girl, and even sang in Punjabi during a recent concert in Mumbai.",
      "Talking about the creation of Azizam, the star said he'd had \"a hell of a lot of fun\" immersing himself in Persian music.",
      "\"I loved how a lot of rhythms, scales, melodies and instruments were different but similar to the Irish trad music I had grown up with.\"",
      "The inspiration came from Salmanzadeh, an Iranian-born Swedish songwriter, who has previously scored major hits with Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "\"One day he was just like, 'I would love to make something within the culture that I come from' and that's how it was sparked,\" Sheeran told Radio 1's Greg James.",
      "\"It's [become] the first single of an album that is super playful and celebratory.\"",
      "Sheeran debuted the song three weeks ago on the streets of New Orleans during a surprise performance in the city's French quarter, accompanied by the Soul Rebels brass band.",
      "The recorded version also includes background vocals from the Citizens of the World Choir, which is made up of refugees and allies.",
      "Early reviews have largely been positive, with a few caveats.",
      "Awarding it three stars, The Guardian said the Persian elements felt incidental to what was an overwhelmingly \"Anglo-Saxon\" pop song.",
      "\"Azizam does its job with the kind of ruthless efficiency you might expect from Sheeran in unabashed pop mode,\" wrote pop critic Alexis Petridis.",
      "\"It has a hook that fully digs into your brain the first time you hear it, and proves impossible to dislodge thereafter.",
      "The song is \"banal, featherweight musical Esperanto\", added the Telegraph's Neil McCormick.",
      "\"Lighter than candy floss and twice as sticky... It will be number one on every Spotify playlist by tomorrow, inescapable all spring and summer, and the next time you ask me, I'll probably declare it a bubblegum classic.\"",
      "Fans were more sympathetic. On Radio 2, one listener texted Sheeran to offer their praise.",
      "\"I'm from an Iranian family,  and there are so many Persian music influences in the song, which is amazing to hear,\" they said.",
      "The song is the first track from Sheeran's eighth studio album, which is due for release later this year.",
      "Speaking on the US chat show The Tonight Show, the 34-year-old confirmed the record would be titled Play, kicking off a new series of records that will be called Pause, Rewind, Fast-Forward and Stop.",
      "He also suggested that he was planning a posthumous release, containing songs written throughout the course of his life. Speaking to host Jimmy Fallon, he joked that album would be called Eject.",
      "His new material comes at a crucial crossroads in his career. One of the biggest-selling acts of the 2010s, the star's last two albums underperformed.",
      "Subtract, released in May 2023, presented a more understated, introspective side to the star's bubbly pop persona - with production from The National's Aaron Dessner.",
      "Although it received some of the best reviews of his career, it was his first album not to go platinum in the UK.",
      "A companion album, Autumn Variations, released later the same year, fared even worse.",
      "Despite debuting at number one, it left the Top 40 after two weeks, and has yet to be certified gold - meaning it has sold fewer than 100,000 copies.",
      "However, the star remains one of the world's most-streamed acts. On Spotify, 12 of his songs have topped 1 billion plays.",
      "The most popular, Shape Of You, is the second-most streamed song of all time, with  4.3 billion streams."

    "story": [
      "The director of a new film set in a sweltering London over 24 hours on A-Level results day says that the city he grew up in is now \"inaccessible\" to many Gen Z young adults.",
      "Last Swim, Sasha Nathwani's first feature film, is the story of an ambitious British Iranian teen, Ziba (played by Deba Hekmat), who, along with her group of friends savours a day of total freedom, as well as experiencing tough decisions and heartbreak, before the group go their separate ways after school.",
      "The director tells the BBC that \"the film was developed and made by Millennials, but it's a Gen Z coming of age story\".",
      "He says his interest in making the film was exploring the idea of lost youth and that the script, co-written by producer Helen Simmons, was written at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, although filmed after restrictions ended.",
      "\"It's not a pandemic film,\" he says, \"but it was developed during that time when young people from all over the world were having the seminal years of their lives taken away.",
      "\"When Helen and I were writing it, the world was opening up and closing down, then opening up and closing down again. There was this pressure, and I remember seeing young people in the park, and thinking how must it be for them?",
      "\"They all live with their parents, they've only got one day together, and tomorrow the world's going to close down again.",
      "\"So the question I was trying to pose with the film was, if you had one day to reclaim your youth, what would you do?\"",
      "Nathwani, who's previously directed music videos as well as short films, says that it's his belief things have worsened for the young after Covid-19.",
      "\"I felt that the world was fraught when we were making it, when we were writing it, and now it's going out into the world, there's an argument that things are even worse now,\" he says.",
      "\"When I was 17 or 18, growing up in London, the city didn't feel inaccessible. It felt accessible, and I didn't feel like doors were being closed in my face.",
      "\"Now I don't even know how a young person has a 24-hour period of freedom without breaking the bank.\"",
      "He added: \"We're in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Not only do things cost so much, but there just aren't opportunities. Education is challenging for lots of different reasons, and some people don't have access because of the exorbitant costs.",
      "\"You see that in the film, as Ziba and her friends are going their separate ways.\"",
      "Anxious about the future",
      "A 2023 study from Oxford University found that the mental health of young people had deteriorated during the UK's three Covid-19 lockdowns, compared with a similar study conducted before the pandemic.",
      "And the latest ONS (Office for National Statistics) figures found that around one in seven 16-24 year olds were not in work, education or training between October-December 2024.",
      "Figures from the King's Trust charity from February 2025 found that most of the 16-25 year olds it had surveyed felt anxious about the future on a daily basis.",
      "Most of the cast members of Last Swim are Gen Z, although Gangs of London actress Narges Rashidi also stars in the story, as Ziba's mother.",
      "Lead star Hekmat, a Kurdish British model and actor, was aged 21 when the film was made.",
      "\"As a generation, there have been things thrown at us, but also taken away,\" she says.",
      "\"That's true of me, but when I look at my brothers, that's when my heart really goes out to the young. My brothers just turned 18 and 20 years old, they were going through adolescence during Covid, there so many changes in their personal and school life anyway, and then for all of that to happen.",
      "\"We're all still regrouping and refiguring ourselves out.\"",
      "'Gen Z friendship'",
      "Filmed in the UK heatwave of 2022, Last Swim takes Ziba and her group of friends through well-known spots of London such as Portobello Road, Hampstead Heath and Primrose Hill by car, bike and train.",
      "Industry publication Screen Daily said the film was \"shot, one suspects, with a touch of guerrilla ingenuity... Last Swim also has a palpably improvised component in the friends' genially pitched running banter.\"",
      "The director agrees that the young cast had freedom to change the script \"to make it as authentic as possible\".",
      "\"I think whenever you tell a story about young characters, you need to give them a certain amount of flexibility,\" Nathwani says.",
      "\"If there was a more natural way of delivering a line in a language that they would more authentically use, we would then write that into the script.",
      "\"And they were very good at challenging me as well. They would challenge me about choices that I and Helen had made on the page if they didn't feel it rang true of their characters.\"",
      "\"This is Gen Z friendship on screen,\" adds Hekmat.",
      "\"Sasha says that his [Millennial] generation is the one of hard knocks and they didn't grow up with the idea that mental health needed to be considered in day to day lives,\" she says.",
      "\"I think a great way of seeing how connected this film is to Gen Z is just the friendship that me and the rest of the gang have together.",
      "\"They're not afraid to ask each other about their feelings and the boys aren't afraid to open up a bit more. I think it's really reflective of our friendships in the way that we are able to speak to each other.\"",
      "As independent cinema tries to seek a greater audience amongst the young post-Covid-19, Nathwani says he hopes his film captures the energy of youth, although tapping into some much harder emotions and decisions.",
      "\"That's the interesting thing about that strange time between school and further education, because the bond that you have with your friends from school will never be closer, tighter than it is during that summer,\" he explains.",
      "\"And the moment that summer ends, those bonds tend to break because people go in different directions. And just in the context of what's happening in the UK, but across the world too, I think that's really challenging for young people, more so than I think we envision.\"",

      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",

      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",

      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",

      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February. Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College London, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy and that she will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",
      "\"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\""

    "summary": "With public satisfaction in the NHS just 21%, one area has a plan to shake up its services that could reduce GP waiting lists, as well as unblock hospital beds - but can it really work nationwide?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the \"broken\" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low.",
      "Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every \u00a3100 spent on community care would otherwise cost \u00a3131 for hospital care.",
      "This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service.",
      "Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof.",
      "The three-story building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support.",
      "In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing.",
      "The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital.",
      "\"We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,\" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. \"The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own \u2013 it requires partnership working.\"",
      "Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a \"pioneering service\" and he is firm that the model could \"be the future of the NHS\".",
      "However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale.",
      "A model system to unblock beds?",
      "In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out.",
      "One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes.",
      "The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home.",
      "\"Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,\" says nurse Dani Fullerton. \"It's so different from anything I have done before.\"",
      "Tackling loneliness to save money",
      "One issue the neighbourhood teams are honing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers.",
      "Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than \u00a39,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity.",
      "So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too.",
      "\"We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,\" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled.",
      "\"The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks.\"",
      "Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding.",
      "At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand.",
      "Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour.",
      "\"Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually.\"",
      "Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months.",
      "\"It meant we had more time for other patients,\" says Dr Suleman. \"We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it.\"",
      "In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%.",
      "However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city.",
      "The knock-on effect for hospitals",
      "The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions.",
      "So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job.",
      "Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service.",
      "This, he says, worked far better for him. \"I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns.\"",
      "Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. \"Here we can see and test patients quickly \u2013 there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results.\"",
      "But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital.",
      "Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds.",
      "The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people.",
      "Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic.",
      "There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than \u00a3100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff.",
      "Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. \"We believe this is the right model,\" he insists.",
      "But there is a catch. As he puts it, \"It only works when the whole system buys into it.\"",
      "Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector",
      "Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder.",
      "\"People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,\" she says.",
      "But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources.",
      "The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, \"been a bit cynical\". \"The problem is that it takes time to get results \u2013 you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact.\"",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "'It's unforgivable': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures",
      "Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not.",
      "This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs.",
      "\"There just isn't enough of the right premises,\" he argues. \"In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped.",
      "\"We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?\"",
      "Political pressure and short-term thinking",
      "There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge.",
      "Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007.",
      "Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. \"We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale.\"",
      "And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first.",
      "Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets.",
      "\"It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,\" he observes.",
      "So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic.",
      "\"It can,\" he says. \"But it will take determination, effort \u2013 and money.\"",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

      "US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has faced a backlash over his handling of the outbreak, visited Texas on Sunday in the wake of the death, which is the third overall in recent weeks.",
      "The southern US state has reported more than 480 cases of measles so far this year as of Friday, a jump from 420 earlier in the week. The outbreak has extended to neighbouring states.",
      "Across the whole of the US, more than 600 cases of measles have been recorded so far this year, more than double the 285 cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded last year.",
      "In 2019, there were a total of 1,274 measles cases recorded across the US, but prior to that there had not been a larger outbreak than this year's since the early 1990s, according to the CDC.",
      "Many of this year's cases - nearly all in unvaccinated people - are related to the outbreak that began in western Texas.",
      "\"This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination,\" Mr Davis said in a statement. \"Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, particularly for those who are unvaccinated.\"",
      "The child - an eight-year-old girl - died early on Thursday.",
      "The BBC contacted the state health department and the US Department of Health and Human Services for comment. Neither agency listed the death in their case counts on Friday.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, Kennedy confirmed the girl's death.",
      "\"My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,\" he said in the statement.",
      "He also said he was engaging with officials there to \"support Texas health officials and to learn how our HHS agencies can better partner with them to control the measles outbreak\". Kennedy said he was deploying a team - as he did in March - to help distribute vaccines, medications and other supplies, among other support services.",
      "\"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote, referring to the measles, mumps and rubella jab.",
      "In February, an unvaccinated six-year-old girl in the local Mennonite community was the first child to die of measles in the US in a decade. In March, an unvaccinated man died in New Mexico after contracting the virus, though his cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that he believes the outbreak is largely contained.",
      "\"It's so far a fairly small number of people, relative to what we're talking about,\" he said. \"It's something that people have known about for many years. This is not something new.\"",
      "\"We'll see what happens. If it progresses, we'll have to take action. Very strong action,\" he said in response to a question from the BBC.",
      "The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.",
      "The US declared measles eliminated from the country in 2000. But outbreaks have grown since then with a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment.",
      "Two shots of the immunisation - proven safe - are 97% effective at preventing the virus and reduce severe infections. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, experts say.",
      "The recent outbreak originated in a religious community that strongly rejects vaccines. Local health officials in western Texas have told the BBC they have seen limited progress in attempts to improve vaccination rates.",
      "Kennedy's early response to the worsening outbreaks was muted, drawing criticism from health experts.",
      "Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, initially described the situation as \"not unusual\".",
      "He changed his approach after a child's died from measles in February - the first in the US in a decade - but stopped short of recommending that parents vaccinate their children. He instead encouraged them to talk to their doctors about the shot.",
      "On Sunday, Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican who represents Louisiana, called for stronger messaging. Cassidy is also a doctor and has previously criticised Kennedy for his sceptical attitude towards vaccination.",
      "\"Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\" Cassidy wrote on social media platform X. \"Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\"",

      "Outlining plans to reduce waiting lists to health leaders on Monday, Jeremy Miles said proposals included putting patients who miss outpatient hospitals at the back of the queue.",
      "Other potential changes include encouraging patients to get \"fit for surgery\", commissioning some private health care at a national level and reform among NHS leadership.",

      "\"On too many occasions, I have been met with the equivalent of a shrugging of shoulders when I've challenged people on why a budget has been blown or a target not met,\" said Miles.",
      "He said consequences are needed among patients who repeatedly miss outpatient appointments, or cancel at the last minute, though the vulnerable and children would be protected.",
      "Miles also proposed the commissioning of some private health care at a national level to enable a more strategic approach.",
      "Greater regional collaboration is needed to help drive down waiting times, according to the health secretary, while reform at the top level of leadership should be refocused to provide better support and allow the Welsh government to \"hold the service to account\".",

      "\"It's not just a simple statement, 'you need to be fitter before you can have the operation'.\"",
      "Miles said 700,000 hospital outpatient appointments were missed or cancelled last year. On average this equates to about 2,700 every working day.",
      "He said patients should do more to improve their own health \"to make the best possible use of scarce NHS resources\".",
      "But FTWW raised concerns that blanket processes risked inadvertently penalising those who experienced \"barriers not of their own making\" and called for engagement with \"diverse patient communities\".",
      "They said one of the biggest issues reported by members was an inability to get hold of someone to cancel or reschedule appointments.",
      "\"We know, for example, that women in particular are more likely to be primary care givers in Wales, so appointments which are made without first establishing other responsibilities and commitments can be problematic.\"",

      "He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.",

      "The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.",
      "It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.",

      "\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.",
      "\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"",

      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",
      "In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.",
      "April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.",
      "\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.",
      "\"It's not a way I want to live for another 10 or 20 or 30 years.\"",

    "story": [
      "It's 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead.",
      "The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella.",
      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",
      "This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.",
      "Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.",

      "Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang said they were on a trip to visit the occupied West Bank to \"witness, first-hand, the situation\" and were \"astounded\" after being stopped at the airport.",
      "Badenoch told the BBC that Israel had a right to \"control its borders\", adding it was \"very significant\" there were Labour MPs other countries did not want to let in.",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said her comments were \"disgraceful\", while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said she had shown \"unbelievably poor judgement\".",

      "MP says he was deported from Africa over China criticism",

      "Senior Tory MP Richard Fuller told Times Radio he thought MPs on official trips should be \"welcomed in any country\", adding \"we should all be very worried\" about democracy.",
      "Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, and Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, flew to Israel from London Luton Airport with two aides on Saturday afternoon.",
      "The Israeli immigration authority said Interior Minister Moshe Arbel denied entry to all four passengers after they were questioned. It accused them of travelling to \"document the security forces\".",
      "Badenoch first made her comments when asked on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show whether Israel was entitled to refuse entry to the MPs.",
      "\"Countries should be able to control their borders,\" she said. \"What I think is shocking is that we have MPs in Labour who other countries will not allow through, I think that's very significant.\"",
      "She continued: \"I believe that the people who represent us in Parliament should be people who should be able to go anywhere in the world and people not be worried about what they're going to do when they go into those countries.\"",
      "Badenoch said the reason given by the Israelis was that \"they don't believe that they're going to comply with their laws\" and \"there are many people that we don't allow into our country and I don't think we should be setting precedents in a different way\".",
      "Tagging a video of the Conservative leader's comments on X, Lammy posted: \"It's disgraceful you are cheerleading another country for detaining and deporting two British MPs.",
      "\"Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?",
      "\"This government will continue to stand up for the rights of our MPs to speak their mind, whatever their party.\"",
      "Reposting the criticism, Badenoch said: \"Unlike China, Israel is our ally and a democracy. A good Foreign Sec would be able to make that distinction.",
      "\"Perhaps Labour MPs could put UK national interest first and do their jobs instead of campaigning for airports in Kashmir or promoting Hamas propaganda in parliament.\"",
      "Further criticism came from Davey on X, who posted: \"Kemi Badenoch has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel.",
      "\"Yet another complete shocker.\"",
      "Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Dame Emily Thornberry told Sky News she was \"completely gobsmacked\" by Badenoch's comments.",
      "\"This is nonsense,\" the Labour MP said. \"You have to stand up for what's right, Kemi Badenoch, and you should stand in solidarity with other parliamentarians who were just going to Israel and the West Bank to find out what was going on.\"",
      "Badenoch was also contradicted by Tory MP Fuller, who told LBC that Conservative MPs had experienced similar issues in China and he wanted to support the right to travel to other countries.",
      "\"I want to support my colleagues,\" said Fuller. \"This isn't a partisan thing, as a parliamentarian, we live in a difficult world at the moment.",
      "\"Democracies are under threat, we should support them in those circumstances, whether China, Israel, or anywhere...",
      "\"On this, my personal view is, parliamentarians should be allowed free passage to other countries, to our allies. We should look at that in a poor light. We should be supporting them.\"",
      "Fuller spoke about his boss again on Times Radio, saying he thought MPs on official trips are \"going there to be better informed about the situation and then report back to their parliamentary colleagues about what they have found\".",

    "summary": "The UK government sought to keep details of its row with Apple over requested access to its encrypted cloud storage tool private.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",
      "Apple declined to comment.",
      "In a previous statement it told the BBC:  \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.",
      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",
      "They can request to view information stored with lower levels of protection - but companies such as Apple have no way of allowing them to view files secured with E2EE because they do not possess such a capability.",
      "Campaign group Privacy International said the right of individuals also needed to be protected - and welcomed today's ruling.",
      "\"Executive decisions affecting the privacy and security of billions of people globally should be open to legal challenge in the most transparent way possible\", it said.",

      "The Falkland Islands was surprised to be hit by one of the most punishing tariff rates on US President Donald Trump's \"worst offenders\" list, a member of the Falklands parliament has told the BBC.",
      "The British overseas territory is facing a 42% tax on the goods it exports to the US under Trump's shake-up of international trade.",
      "Teslyn Barkman, who oversees trade in the parliament, said the taxes would impact the economy, which is heavily dependent on the sale of fish to the EU and the US.",
      "But Barkman said the Falklands government would not respond with retaliatory tariffs and wanted a \"warm\" relationship with the US.",
      "Only eight other countries or territories dubbed the \"worst offenders\" for trade imbalances were given higher rates on Trump's list of tariffs, which are due to come into effect on Wednesday.",
      "\"It was a surprise,\" Barkman told the BBC. \"The fact a global superpower such as the US was paying attention to us at all caught us off guard.\"",

      "The territory has a government and sets its own trade policy, while the UK takes responsibility for its defence and foreign affairs.",
      "In 2023, the Falklands government reported a national income of \u00a3280m, with fishing accounting for 60% of gross domestic product (GDP).",
      "\"We're a village running a country,\" said Barkman, who holds responsibility for trade and economic development in the Legislative Assembly.",

      "\"The UK government has a responsibility to step up and defend British citizens everywhere \u2013 including in the Falklands.",
      "\"President Trump has arbitrarily decided to hit Falklanders with some of his highest tariffs in an outrageous act of aggression that cannot be allowed to stand.\"",
      "Barkman said the Falklands was still trying to figure out why Trump decided to levy a 42% tariff on its goods. The US imposed a 10% tariff on UK products.",
      "As analysis by BBC Verify showed, the tariffs are based on a calculation that factors in the difference in goods traded between the US and other countries.",
      "\"We're certainly not looking at any anything retaliatory at all,\" Barkman said.",
      "\"We need to understand how that figure was arrived at because certainly the Falkland Islands approach has been that we're here to support the UK and her Western allies.",
      "She added: \"We want a warm relationship with the US as well.\"",

      "\"Maybe that's an opportunity for us to build a closer relationship,\" Barkman said.",

    "story": [
      "Male fruit flies that drink alcohol become more attractive to females, according to a new study.",
      "Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.",
      "Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.",
      "Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.",
      "Previous research has studied different theories about this attraction, such as the flies were seeking a euphoric state or a substitute for the high of mating among males rejected by females.",
      "Study author Bill Hansson, head of the Department of Evolutionary Neuroethology at the Max Planck Institute, said such research has taken an anthropomorphic view of fly behaviour, whereas this latest study suggests drinking alcohol gives the flies a reproductive advantage.",
      "\"We don't think flies drink alcohol because they are depressed,\" he said.",
      "The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.",
      "In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.",
      "Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.",
      "Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.",
      "The new study also showed that the fly's response to smelling alcohol is controlled by three different neural circuits in its brain.",
      "While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.",
      "Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.",
      "\"This means that the flies have a control mechanism that allows them to get all the benefits of alcohol consumption without risking alcohol intoxication,\" lead author Ian Keesey, of the University of Nebraska, said.",
      "For their investigations, the researchers combined physiological studies - such as imaging techniques to visualise processes in the fly brain, chemical analyses of environmental odours, and behavioural studies.",
      "The paper is published in the journal Science Advances."

    "story": [
      "The Environment Agency (EA) has launched a comprehensive review into shipments of waste tyres from the UK to India.",
      "Last week, BBC File on 4 Investigates heard that millions of these tyres - sent for recycling - were actually being \"cooked\" in makeshift furnaces, causing serious health problems and environmental damage.",
      "The pressure group Fighting Dirty has threatened legal proceedings against the EA over what it called a \"lack of action\" over the issue of tyre exports.",
      "The EA has asked the group to wait until its own review is complete, and it has also asked File on 4 Investigates to share the evidence from its investigation.",
      "The UK generates about 50 million waste tyres (nearly 700,000 tonnes) every year. According to official figures, about half of these are exported to India, supposedly to be recycled.",
      "But BBC File on 4 Investigates and Source Material, a non-profit journalism group, revealed that some 70% of tyres exported to India from the UK and the rest of the world are being sent to makeshift industrial plants, where they are \"cooked\" in order to extract steel, small amounts of oil as well as carbon black - a powder or pellet that can be used in various industries.",
      "Conditions at these plants - many of which are in rural backwaters - can be toxic and harmful to public health, as well as potentially dangerous.",
      "In January, two women and two children were killed in an explosion at a plant in the western state of Maharashtra, where European-sourced tyres were being processed.",
      "A BBC team visited the site and saw soot, dying vegetation and polluted waterways around. Villagers complained of persistent coughs and eye problems.",
      "Following the broadcast, the Department for the Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) told BBC File on 4 Investigates that officials and lawyers within the EA were \"very keen\" to investigate the claims made in the programme, including any potential criminal activity.",
      "In a letter seen by the BBC, lawyers for the EA said that our investigation would be carefully considered as part of a review it has launched into its approach to waste tyre shipments.",
      "They added that the EA has been working to engage the relevant environmental authorities in India on this issue and is taking steps to arrange a delegation to meet with officials later this year.",
      "Fighting Dirty founder Georgia Elliott-Smith, who has been in correspondence with the EA over this issue since 2023, said it was a \"major victory\" for the group and that \"the government must stop turning a blind eye to the illegal and immoral activity\".",

    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",

      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",

      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",

      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",

      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",

      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",

      "Despite excitement over its upcoming launch in June, fan conversations have been dominated by one topic - the price of its games.",
      "The console itself is priced similarly to its rivals - Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X.",
      "But the games are a different story: Mario Kart World, which is being launched alongside the Switch 2, comes in at \u00a374.99.",
      "\"It makes it inaccessible, it's a lot to drop on one game,\" said Chloe Crossan, one of several gamers the BBC spoke to at a gaming store in Glasgow.",
      "I played the \u00a375 Mario Kart World on Switch 2 - was it worth it?",
      "She told the BBC she was excited about the console and its various games, but was concerned about the cost involved.",
      "\"I guess you could argue you're paying for a game that four people could play,\" she said.",
      "\"So there is that element - but it is \u00a375 for a game which is a lot.\"",
      "It's not expected that all of the Switch 2's titles will be so expensive - but charging so much for its best-known game still represents a big change in Nintendo's pricing strategy.",
      "It also risks confusing customers, as the same games can be purchased for different amounts depending on whether they are buying the physical game or the digital-only version.",
      "Experts don't think Mario Kart World will be a one off.",
      "Christopher Dring, editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Game Business, said he expected to see price rises elsewhere too - particularly for the most anticipated titles, such as the latest edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise.",
      "\"I think if you're going see a game that's going to be able to charge more, look out for when GTA 6 gets a release date later in the year,\" he said.",
      "He says there are lots of reasons prices might go up, part of which is that modern games are a lot of work.",
      "\"These games are taking longer to make, they require more people to make them,\" he said.",
      "But there's also the fact, he says, that video game prices have not kept up with inflation.",
      "\"I bought N64 games for \u00a350 in the turn of the century and that's \u00a380 today,\" he pointed out.",
      "For some time developers have got round that by monetising transactions in games and relying more on cheaper digital downloads.",
      "But that process, Mr Dring says, is running out of road.",
      "\"That growth has started to slow, so they're now relying on price increases.\"",
      "But it's clear those kinds of prices won't put everyone off.",
      "Another gamer the BBC spoke to, Kathryn Brown, said she and her family were excited about the Switch 2 - even if it was \"more expensive than usual\".",
      "\"If it gets good reviews, and I wait until people have bought it first, then we'll think about it,\" she said.",
      "And Lewis Tocher - who's had the original Switch since the day it launched - said he would get the console as soon as he could afford it, despite the cost of the games.",
      "But he said considering the cost of game development nowadays, he was \"surprised\" it hadn't gone up in price sooner.",
      "But what will retailers make of it?",
      "Mr Dring told the BBC this was the first time a console's physical and digital games were being priced differently.",
      "He said that could be a real blow for the people who sell the physical games.",
      "\"When a Nintendo Switch game releases, around 80% of its sales are in a box - if you compare that to Xbox, around 80% of new game sales are digital.",
      "\"By charging more for the physical copy it's going to encourage people to download more, which will be good for Nintendo's bottom line.\"",
      "But of course it will be worse for the retailers who miss out on sales of the physical game.",
      "The price of failure",
      "One thing Nintendo will be hoping to avoid replicating is the disastrous launch of its handheld 3DS in 2011.",
      "It came hot off the heels of the DS, the best-selling handheld in history, with fans seemingly desperate for an upgrade.",
      "But the price tag of over \u00a3200 - more than double that of the original handheld - sparked consternation amongst fans who weren't willing to shell out so much for it.",
      "Within six months, Nintendo had slashed the price by almost half, and over time it picked up traction.",
      "It is fair to say the 3DS faced other problems such as a lacklustre list of launch games, whereas the Switch 2 is launching with the first Mario Kart game in a decade.",
      "Nonetheless Nintendo has form with price decisions backfiring.",
      "The N64 launched at \u00a3250 back in 1997, and within a year it had tumbled down to \u00a399.",
      "And in 2002 the firm cut \u00a321 off it widely-expected \u00a3150 price for the GameCube just two weeks before its launch.",
      "By bringing back the likes of Mario and Donkey Kong for the Switch 2, Nintendo has consciously looked to the past with its new console.",

      "But it's not so much the price of the Switch 2 but its games that have been raising eyebrows, with the new Mario Kart World that is being released alongside it coming in at a whopping \u00a374.99 for a physical copy.",

      "What's it like to play?",
      "It's fair to say Mario Kart World makes a fantastic first impression, thanks to the console having more power under the hood.",
      "It looks spectacular compared to previous Switch titles, though we're still talking about cartoony graphics - make no mistake, the console is more powerful but it's no match for the higher spec PlayStation 5, let alone PS5 Pro.",
      "And in my three races the standout feature wasn't the swishy new graphics or the controller, it was a trick that is becoming Nintendo's hallmark: making the new feel familiar.",
      "Despite having never picked up a Switch 2, I stormed my way to consecutive first place finishes, much to the chagrin of those around me.",
      "But it doesn't come cheap.",
      "The digital version of the game costs \u00a366.99, it's another \u00a38 on top of that for a physical copy - or pay an an extra \u00a335 for a version of the Switch 2 with it built-in, something which pushes the console price to \u00a3429.99.",
      "According to industry expert Christopher Dring, these wallet-emptying prices are down to the costs involved in manufacturing - and President Donald Trump's tariff blitz.",
      "\u201cThese cartridges are exclusively made in Japan, which is a country that's just been hit with a 24% tariff from the US Government, and the threat of those tariffs may have impacted Nintendo's pricing decisions globally,\u201d he said.",

      "Mouse control and Donkey Kong destruction",
      "But there\u2019s more to the Switch 2 than Mario Kart.",
      "Fans will no doubt have been excited to see the hotly anticipated Metroid Prime 4,  the first game in the series in 18 years.",
      "But while they will be familiar with the typical way of playing - moving and aiming with joysticks and shooting with the \"A\" button - there\u2019s a significant new feature too.",
      "At any point in the game you can rotate the controller, put it on a surface and use it like a mouse. Fans of PC games will immediately feel at home with this, and it's a neat bit of engineering to be able to switch up on-the-fly without having to enter any menus.",
      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",
      "But in both cases, I do wonder how long you can play with the controller like this before the ergonomics become an issue. I have to admit I found myself wondering why I wasn't just playing on my PC with mouse controls and a comfortable resting position.",
      "Still, the fact that this is built in to the hardware means we may see the Switch 2 as the obvious home of future PC ports to home consoles.",
      "And there is another trick up Nintendo\u2019s sleeve - both controllers can be held like this and used as mice, opening up some interesting possibilities. In particular, futuristic wheelchair basketball game Drag x Drive, where both \"mice\" are pushed to mimic moving wheels.",
      "Elsewhere, Donkey Kong Bananza will be the first time the ape mascot has had a 3D platforming game of his own in 25 years, so there was some pressure on Nintendo to deliver a game which justified the wait.",
      "For lack of a better term it\u2019s a destruct-em-up - you can destroy much of the floor and scenery in each level.",
      "But there's that dreaded price news again. A digital copy will cost \u00a358.99, while a physical copy retails at \u00a366.99.",
      "It seems Nintendo has a lot to offer Switch fans - but it will be taking a fair bit from them too.",
      "Rivals and originals",
      "Some other titles I got to see in action were updated versions of Cyberpunk 2077 and Yakuza 0 - both of which big hitters on rival consoles which were deemed too complex to run on the original Switch.",
      "Like the other Switch 2 games, they looked good - and of course they will benefit as the new console, like the original, can play games on the go.",
      "The original Switch created the genre of the hybrid console - one which works on a TV and as a portable system.",
      "But since that launch in 2017, things have changed a bit.",
      "Now, it has a rival in the Steam Deck, a hybrid machine with the power to play most PC games.",
      "Nintendo would say something its rivals don\u2019t have is that long list of exclusive titles.",
      "But there is a bit of a theme here: Nintendo has consciously gone for continuity.",
      "The console is the Switch 2, rather than having a completely new name. Many of those exclusives Nintendo is so proud of are new games in established series, while others are remasters of modern classics.",
      "I had great experiences with these games in the 20 minutes I had with them.",
      "But for fans to get value for those high prices they will want something that holds up over weeks and months of gameplay.",
      "Will the Switch 2's slick nostalgia hit provide that? We'll start to find out in June."

      "The organisation released the full video found on the phone of one of its eight paramedics who died when troops fired at a convoy of ambulances on 23 March, which it said constituted a \"fully fledged war crime\".",
      "It called on those responsible to be held to account.",
      "Israel's military said on Monday that a preliminary inquiry indicated troops \"opened fire due to a perceived threat following a previous encounter in the area, and that six of the individuals killed in the incident were identified as Hamas terrorists\", without giving evidence.",
      "A Red Crescent paramedic who survived has denied his colleagues were linked with any armed groups.",
      "The Israeli military initially said its troops fired on \"suspicious vehicles\" driving with their lights off.",

      "A second ambulance then approaches from the other direction, and Radwan and Nassasra decide to travel with them in a convoy following a conversation with its driver.",

      "The emergency vehicles pull over and the sound of gunfire begins just as Radwan gets out. It continues for more than five minutes and Radwan is heard saying his last prayers, before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching.",
      "The Red Crescent said on Wednesday that the video showed \"this was neither a random incident nor an individual error, but rather a series of deliberate attacks\".",
      "\"The first was the shooting of an ambulance en route to evacuate casualties after a home was bombed in the al-Hashashin area.\"",
      "\"This was followed by a direct attack on the PRCS and Civil Defence ambulance convoy - despite the team following all safety protocols - and then by the targeting of a fourth ambulance that was heading to support the others,\" it added.",
      "The society insisted the area had not been classified by the Israeli military as a \"red zone\", which meant no prior co-ordination was required to access the site, and that the video showed that Israeli military vehicles had not been visible in the area.",
      "It also said preliminary forensic reports showed that the medics were killed by \"multiple gunshot wounds to the upper parts of the bodies\", which it described as \"further evidence of deliberate killing\".",
      "At a news conference in the occupied West Bank on Monday, the society's president Dr Younes al-Khatib called for an independent international investigation into the incident and for those responsible to be held accountable.",

      "\"And justice was not brought to them. We hope this time and through these 15 men, we can bring justice.\"",
      "Khatib dismissed the Israeli military's inquiry, saying the society did not \"trust\" it to provide all the answers about what happened due to \"previous experience\".",
      "He also rejected the military's accusation that Hamas operatives were among those killed, saying it had failed \"to prove even once in 50 years that the Red Crescent or its crew carry or use weapons\".",
      "Later, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that its Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, had been presented with the findings of the initial inquiry into the incident and instructed that it be \"pursued in greater depth and completed in the coming days by the general staff investigation mechanism\".",

      "Prince Laurent - the younger brother of King Philippe - received \u20ac388,000 (\u00a3295,850; $376,000) from state funds last year but said that his work entitles him and his family to social security.",

      "However, according to broadcaster VTM the judge acknowledged that the prince should actually be entitled to a pension - but said gaps in legislation made that impossible and called for the law to be amended.",
      "His lawyer, Olivier Rijckaert, told Belgian newspaper Le Soir that Laurent's request had not been based on a \"whim\" and insisted on its symbolism, saying that social security is \"granted by Belgian law to all residents, from the most deprived to the richest\".",

      "Laurent took legal action against the Belgian state after his application for social security was refused. A first hearing was held in November 2024.",
      "According to RTBF, the prince and his legal counsel have not yet decided whether to appeal the court's decision.",
      "Laurentm who is the 15th in the Belgian line of succession, is no stranger to controversy and is sometimes termed the prince maudit - the \"cursed prince\" - in Belgium.",
      "In 2018, the Belgian federal parliament voted to dock his monthly allowance for a year after he attended a Chinese embassy reception without government permission, in full naval uniform.",

      "Two shots of the immunisation - proven safe - are 97% effective at preventing the virus and reduce severe infections. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, experts say.",
      "The recent outbreak originated in a religious community that strongly rejects vaccines. Local health officials in western Texas have told the BBC they have seen limited progress in attempts to improve vaccination rates.",

    "story": [
      "A billionaire backer of Donald Trump has urged the US president to pause his recently announced trade tariffs, or risk \"a self-induced, economic nuclear winter\".",
      "Amid market turmoil, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said the president should take three months to allow countries to renegotiate their trading relationships with the US.",
      "On Monday, Mr Ackman's warning was echoed by other prominent Wall Street figures, with JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon saying that Trump's tariffs risked pushing up prices for Americans.",
      "Despite the shockwaves, the American president is moving ahead, with the White House rushing to label a rumour he might put new tariffs on pause as \"fake news\".",
      "The rumour on Monday morning that Trump was considering a 90-day pause briefly lifted a swiftly sinking stock market after it was reported on financial network CNBC.",
      "The White House almost immediately shot down the report, showing Trump's commitment to his new import taxes. Stock prices largely stabilised afterward.",
      "The \"baseline\" tariffs of 10% on most countries' goods that Trump announced last week have already gone into effect, while the higher \"reciprocal\" rates he wants to impose on the \"worst offenders\" are expected later this week. Some countries are seeking to negotiate lower rates with the White House.",
      "The new tariffs, added to steep levies Trump has already put on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as all automobile imports, are worrying business and economic leaders that they will push up prices for American consumers and spark a global trade war.",
      "The head of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said on Monday that the tariffs will raise prices and possibly inflation, and contribute to an economic downturn, according to media reports.",
      "\"Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,\" Larry Fink, the firm's CEO, told a meeting of the Economic Club of New York.",
      "Goldman Sachs on Sunday said there is a 45% probability of the US entering a recession within the year, after estimating a 35% probability a week ago, before Trump unveiled his tariff plans at an event called \"Liberation Day\".",
      "Trump says the import taxes will boost his country with new jobs and investment.",
      "He defended them on Sunday, telling reporters aboard Air Force One that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".",
      "In his post on X on Sunday, Mr Ackman acknowledged the Trump argument that the global trade system had \"disadvantaged\" the US.",
      "But, he wrote, tariffs that Trump had imposed were \"massive and disproportionate\", and did not distinguish between American friends and enemies.",
      "Mr Ackman, the billionaire founder of Pershing Square hedge fund management company, became a high-profile supporter of Trump, a Republican, in July 2024.",
      "He had previously backed the rival Democratic Party, and his intervention was seen as an important electoral endorsement from the world of business.",

      "Numerous countries have vowed to respond, and China has already retaliated with new tariffs of its own on goods imported from the US. Trump on Monday threatened to  put an additional 50% tariff on goods from the country, which would bring the total taxes he intends to charge to more than 100%.",
      "Trump had launched an \"economic war against the whole world at once\" that risked shattering investor confidence in the US, Mr Ackman commented.",
      "Mr Ackman said the American leader now had \"an opportunity to call a 90-day time out, negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country\".",
      "His post on Sunday indicated that he felt the ball was back in Trump's court - after an earlier message on X which urged leaders of other countries to \"pick up the phone\" to make a deal with Trump.",
      "As stock markets around the world continued their slump on Monday, the head of banking giant JPMorgan Chase offered his own take, warning of \"many uncertainties\" around the new tariffs policy.",
      "In a letter to shareholders, Mr Dimon said the tariffs will \"likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession\".",
      "\"The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,\" he wrote.",
      "Trump's officials have downplayed the recession risk. The baseline 10% tariff is already in effect, with the higher rates faced by some countries due to come into effect on Wednesday.",
      "Speaking aboard the presidential plane on a flight back to Washington DC on Sunday, Trump himself said European and Asian countries were \"dying to make a deal\"."

    "summary": "President says trip by Shahram Dabiri, the vice-president for parliamentary affairs, was \"indefensible\" while Iran's economy suffers.",
    "story": [
      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has fired one of his deputies for taking a \"lavish\" trip to Antarctica with his wife during Nowruz, the Persian new year.",
      "The president's office described Shahram Dabiri's trip as \"unjustifiable and unacceptable given the ongoing economic challenges\" in Iran.",
      "A picture of Dabiri and his wife posing in front of MV Plancius, which was bound for Antarctica, circulated widely on social media and caused outrage in Iran.",
      "In a statement on Saturday, Pezeshkian said Dabari had been removed as vice president of parliamentary affairs for \"indefensible\" actions, regardless of whether they were financed from his own pocket.",
      "\"In a government that seeks to follow the values of the first Shia Imam (Imam Ali), and amid significant economic pressures on our people, the lavish travels of government officials, even when personally financed, are indefensible,\" Pezeshkian said.",
      "Iran's economy is under significant strain, and subject to Western sanctions due in part to its support of groups including Hamas and Hezbollah, which have been proscribed terrorist organisations by the US, UK and the EU.",
      "Iran's unemployment rate as of October 2024 was 8.4%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), while its annual inflation rate was 29.5%.",
      "Pezeshkian said Dabiri's actions \"starkly contradict the principle of simplicity that is paramount for those in positions of authority\".",
      "The Antarctica expedition on the MV Plancius reportedly has a starting cost equivalent to $6,685 (\u00a35,187).",
      "Usually, visits to the coldest and least populated continent in the world are carried out by scientists and seasoned explorers.",
      "However, tourism voyages on cruises have surged in popularity in recent years. The Dutch vessel pictured in the picture of Dabiri, for example, was used by the Royal Netherlands Navy for military and civilian research between 1976 and 2004.",
      "It is not clear what expedition package Dabiri chose or what mode of transport he took from Iran to Antarctica.",
      "On one of the many package deals available online, explorers need to embark and disembark from Ushuaia, one of the southernmost points of Argentina.  The town is about 3,079km (1,913 miles) from Buenos Aires, the Argentinian capital.",
      "The Iranian president was elected last year with a promise to revive the economy and improve Iranians' daily lives. He replaced Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash.",
      "Iranian media reported that many of Pezeshkian's supporters urged him to remove Dabiri from post as the public grew disgruntled over the trip."

    "summary": "Thousands of protesters gathered for the most visible opposition movement of Trump's second term.",
    "story": [
      "Crowds of protesters gathered in cities across the US on Saturday to denounce President Trump, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January.",
      "The \"Hands Off\" protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities.",
      "Protesters cited grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues.",
      "Coming days after Trump's announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin.",
      "In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings.",
      "Law student Katie Smith told BBC News that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month.",
      "\"You can stand up today or you can be taken later,\" she said, adding: \"I'm not usually a protest girlie.\"",
      "In London, protesters held signs reading, \"WTAF America?\", \"Stop hurting people\" and \"He's an idiot\".",
      "They chanted \"hands off Canada\", \"hands off Greenland\" and \"hands off Ukraine\", referencing Trump's changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland. He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump's administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce.",
      "Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the \"billionaire takeover of our government\".",
      "\"When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,\" he shouted.",
      "The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points.",
      "In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration's policies and Elon Musk's influence.",
      "Some polls show approval ratings for President Trump to be slipping slightly.",
      "One Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week found that his approval rating had dropped to 43%, its lowest point since Trump began his second term in January. When he was inaugurated on 20 January, his approval rating was 47%.",
      "The same poll found that 37% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 30% approve of his strategy to address the cost of living in the US.",
      "Another recent poll, from Harvard Caps/Harris, found that 49% of registered voters approve of Trump's performance in office, down from 52% last month. The same poll, however, found that 54% of voters believe he is doing a better job than Joe Biden did as president.",
      "One protester in Washington named Theresa told the BBC that she was there because \"we're losing our democratic rights\".",
      "\"I'm very concerned about the cuts they're making to the federal government,\" she said, adding that she is also concerned about retirement and education benefits.",
      "Asked if she thought Trump was receiving the protesters' message, she said: \"Well, let's see. [Trump has] been golfing just about every day.\"",
      "Trump held no public events on Saturday, and spent the day golfing at a resort he owns in Florida. He was scheduled to play golf again on Sunday.",
      "The White House released a statement defending Trump's positions, saying he would continue to protect programs such as Medicare and pointing to Democrats as the threat.",
      "\"President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.\"",
      "One of Trump's top immigration advisors, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Saturday that protesters held a rally outside of his New York home, but that he was in Washington at the time.",
      "\"They can protest a vacant house all they want,\" Homan said, adding that their presence \"tied up\" law enforcement and prevented officials from seeing to more important tasks.",
      "\"Protests and rallies, they don't mean anything,\" Homan continued.",
      "\"So go ahead and exercise your first amendment [free speech] rights. It's not going to change the facts of the case.\""

    "story": [
      "Warning: This article contains distressing content",
      "Palestinian detainees released back to Gaza have told the BBC they were subjected to mistreatment and torture at the hands of Israeli military and prison staff, adding to reports of misconduct within Israel's barracks and jails.",
      "One man said he was attacked with chemicals and set alight. \"I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out [on my body],\" said Mohammad Abu Tawileh, a 36-year-old mechanic.",
      "We have conducted in-depth interviews with five released detainees, all of whom were arrested in Gaza in the months after Hamas and other groups killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage. The men were held under Israel's Unlawful Combatants Law, a measure by which people suspected of posing a security risk can be detained for an unspecified period without charge, as Israel set out to recover the hostages and dismantle the proscribed terror group.",
      "The men say they were accused of having links with Hamas and questioned over the location of hostages and tunnels, but were not found to be involved in the 7 October 2023 attacks - a condition Israel had set for anyone released under the recent ceasefire deal.",
      "Some of those freed under the deal were serving sentences for other serious crimes, including the killing of Israelis, but that was not the case for our interviewees. We also asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Prison Service (IPS) if there were any convictions or accusations against the men but they did not respond to that question.",
      "In the men's testimony:",
      "They each describe being stripped, blindfolded, cuffed and beatenSome also say they were given electric shocks, menaced by dogs, and denied access to medical careSome say they witnessed the deaths of other detaineesOne says he witnessed sexual abuseAnother says he had his head dunked in chemicals and his back set on fire",
      "They each describe being stripped, blindfolded, cuffed and beaten",
      "Some also say they were given electric shocks, menaced by dogs, and denied access to medical care",
      "Some say they witnessed the deaths of other detainees",
      "One says he witnessed sexual abuse",
      "Another says he had his head dunked in chemicals and his back set on fire",
      "We have seen reports by a lawyer who visited two of the men in prison, and have spoken to medical staff who treated some of them on their return.",
      "The BBC sent a lengthy right of reply letter to the IDF which laid out in detail the men's allegations and their identities.",
      "In its statement, the IDF did not respond to any of the specific allegations, but said it \"completely rejects accusations of systematic abuse of detainees\".",
      "It said some of the cases raised by the BBC would be \"examined by the relevant authorities\". It added that others \"were brought without sufficient detail, without any detail regarding the identity of the detainees, making them impossible to examine\".",
      "It continued: \"The IDF takes any\u2026 actions which contradict its values very seriously\u2026 Specific complaints about inappropriate behaviour by detention facility staff or insufficient conditions are forwarded for examination by the relevant authorities and are dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, disciplinary actions are taken against the staff members of the facility, and criminal investigations are opened.\"",
      "The IPS said it was not aware of any of the claims of abuse described in our investigation, in its prisons. \"[A]s far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" it added.",
      "Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said the treatment the men described was \"entirely inconsistent with both international law and Israeli law\", and in some cases would \"meet the threshold of torture\".",
      "\"Under international law, the law of armed conflict requires you to treat all detainees humanely,\" he said. \"The obligations relating to the basic needs of detainees are unaffected by any alleged wrongdoing.\"",
      "The five Palestinians interviewed in depth were returned earlier this year under the ceasefire deal with Hamas - the group that led the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.",
      "They were among about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees exchanged for 33 Israeli hostages, eight dead and 25 living, some of whom have described being abused, starved and threatened by their Hamas captors.",
      "Female hostages previously released have detailed physical and sexual assaults in captivity.",
      "Israel says forensic tests show some of the dead hostages returned in the ceasefire, including children, were killed by Hamas, though the group denies this.",
      "The five released Palestinian detainees all described the same pattern - being arrested in Gaza, taken into Israel to be detained first in military barracks before being moved on to prison, and finally released back to Gaza months later.",
      "They said they had been abused at every stage of the process.",
      "More than a dozen other released detainees, whom the BBC spoke to more briefly as they arrived home in Gaza, also gave accounts of beatings, hunger and disease.",
      "These, in turn, align with testimony given by others to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem and the United Nations, which in July detailed reports from returning detainees that they had been stripped naked, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burned with cigarettes, and had dogs set on them.",
      "A further report by UN experts last month documented cases of rape and sexual assault, and said using this as a threat was \"standard operating procedure\" for the IDF. Israel responded to say it \"categorically rejects the unfounded allegations\".",
      "As Israel does not currently allow international journalists free access to Gaza, our interviews were conducted by phone call and text message, and also in person by our contracted freelancers in the territory.",
      "All five men told us their abuse had begun at the moment of their arrest - when they said they had been stripped, blindfolded and beaten.",
      "Mechanic Mohammad Abu Tawileh told us he had been tortured for days.",
      "He was taken by soldiers to a building not far from the location of his arrest in March 2024, he said, and held in a room - the sole detainee there - for three days of interrogation by troops.",
      "Warning: Graphic image below",
      "Soldiers mixed chemicals used for cleaning into a pot, he told us, and dunked his head in them. The interrogators then punched him, he said, and he fell to the rubble-strewn floor, injuring his eye. He said they then covered his eye with a cloth, which he said \"worsened his injury\".",
      "They also set him alight, he told us.",
      "\"They used an air freshener with a lighter to set my back on fire. I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out. It spread from my neck down to my legs. Then, they repeatedly hit me with the bottoms of their rifles, and had sticks with them, which they used to hit and poke me on my sides,\" he said.",
      "They then \"continued pouring acid on me. I spent around a day and a half being washed with [it],\" he told us.",
      "\"They poured it on my head, and it dripped down my body while I was sitting on the chair.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, soldiers poured water on his body, and drove him into Israel where he received medical treatment in hospital, including skin grafts.",
      "Most of his treatment, he said, took place at a field hospital at Sde Teiman barracks, an IDF base near Beersheba in southern Israel. He said he was cuffed naked to a bed and given a nappy instead of access to a toilet. Israeli doctors at this hospital have previously told the BBC shackling patients and forcing them to wear nappies is routine.",
      "When the BBC interviewed Mr Abu Tawileh shortly after his release, his back was covered in red welts. The residual pain from his burns still woke him up, he said, and his vision had been affected.",
      "The BBC was not able to speak to anyone who witnessed an attack on Mr Abu Tawileh, but a specialist eye doctor who treated him on his return to Gaza confirmed that he had suffered a chemical burn to the eye, damaging the skin around it. He also said Mr Abu Tawileh's vision was weakening, due to either the chemicals or other trauma.",
      "We showed images of his injuries and gave details of his testimony to several UK doctors, who said they appeared consistent with his account, though they noted there were limitations to what they could assess by looking at photos.",
      "The BBC gave extensive details of this account to the IDF, giving it five days to investigate. It did not respond directly to Mr Abu Tawileh's allegations but said it took any actions \"which contradict its values very seriously\".",
      "It said it would \"examine\" some of the cases, but did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this included Mr Abu Tawileh.",
      "Others we interviewed also described abuse at the point of arrest.",
      "\"They cuffed us and hit us. No-one would give me a drop of water,\" said Abdul Karim Mushtaha, a 33-year-old poultry slaughterhouse worker, who told us he was arrested in November 2023 at an Israeli checkpoint while following evacuation orders with his family. A report filed by a lawyer who later visited Mr Mushtaha noted he had been \"subjected to severe beatings, humiliation, degradation and stripping during his arrest until he was transferred to prison\".",
      "Two said they had then been left outside in the cold for hours, and two said Israeli soldiers stole their belongings and money.",
      "The BBC gave details of the allegations of theft to the IDF, which described it as \"contrary to the law and IDF values\". It said it would \"thoroughly\" examine the cases if more details were provided.",
      "All our interviewees, including Mr Mushtaha, said they were transferred to the Israeli barracks of Sde Teiman, where Mr Abu Tawileh also said he received treatment in its field hospital.",
      "One interviewee told us he was mistreated on the way there. He asked for his name not to be published for fear of reprisals, so we are calling him \"Omar\".",
      "He said Israeli soldiers stood and spat on him, and others with him, calling them \"sons of pigs\" and \"sons of Sinwar\" - referring to the Hamas leader and architect of the 7 October attacks, killed by Israel five months ago.",
      "\"They made us listen to a voice recording that said: 'What you did to our children, we will do to your children',\" said the 33-year-old, who worked for an electrical cable company.",
      "Sde Teiman has been the focus of previous serious complaints in the wake of the October 2023 attacks. Several soldiers stationed there were charged in February after they were filmed assaulting a detainee, resulting in his hospitalisation for a torn rectum and a punctured lung. In a separate case, a soldier at the base was sentenced after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza.",
      "Three of the men we spoke to alleged that dogs were used to intimidate detainees at Sde Teiman and other facilities.",
      "\"We would get beaten up when they took us from the barracks to the medical clinic or the interrogation room - they'd set [muzzled] dogs on us, tighten our cuffs,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh who was held in general detention in the barracks, as well as being treated there.",
      "The BBC asked the IDF to respond to allegations it frequently used dogs to intimidate and attack detainees. It said: \"The use of dogs to harm detainees is prohibited.\"",
      "It also said there were \"experienced terrorists considered to be very dangerous among the detainees held in IDF detention facilities\" and that \"in exceptional cases there is extended shackling during their detention\".",
      "Several detainees said they had been forced to assume stress positions, including having their arms lifted above their heads for hours.",
      "\"We would be sitting on our knees from 5am until 10pm, when it was time to sleep,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh.",
      "Hamad al-Dahdouh, another interviewee, said beatings at the barracks \"targeted our heads and sensitive areas like the eyes [and] ears\".",
      "The 44-year-old, who worked as a farmer before the war, said he had suffered temporary back and ear damage as a result, and his rib cage had been fractured.",
      "The IDF did not respond to this allegation.",
      "Mr Dahdouh and some of the other released detainees said electric shocks were also used during interrogations or as punishment.",
      "\"The oppression units would bring dogs, sticks and stun guns, they would electrocute and beat us,\" he said.",
      "They would be subjected to beatings and intimidation every time they were moved, Mr Abu Tawileh added.",
      "During these interrogations they had been accused of links with Hamas, the men added.",
      "\"Anyone who was imprisoned\u2026 they said: 'You are a terrorist',\" said Mr Mushtaha. \"They always tried to tell us that we had taken part in 7 October. They all had a grudge.",
      "\"I told them: 'If I am Hamas or anyone else, would I be moving through the safe passage? Would I have listened to your calls to leave?'\"",
      "He said interrogations would go through the night.",
      "\"For three nights, I couldn't sleep because they were torturing me. Our hands were tied and put above our heads for hours, and we weren't wearing anything. Any time you would say 'I'm cold'\u2026 they would fill a bucket with cold water, pour it on you and switch on the fan.\"",
      "Mr Dahdouh said their interrogators told them that whoever is from Gaza \"is affiliated with terrorist groups\", and when detainees asked if they could challenge this in court they were told there was no time for that.",
      "He said he was not given access to a lawyer. The IDF told the BBC: \"Israeli law grants the right to judicial review in a civil district court, legal representation by an attorney, and the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.\"",
      "\"Omar\" said he was taken for three days of interrogation when he first arrived at Sde Teiman.",
      "He said the detainees were dressed in thin overalls and held in a freezing room, with loud speakers playing Israeli music.",
      "When the questioning was over, the men said they were led back to the barracks blindfolded.",
      "\"We didn't know if night had come or morning had come. You don't see the sun. You don't see anything,\" said Omar.",
      "The IDF said it had \"oversight mechanisms\", including closed-circuit cameras, \"to ensure that detention facilities are managed in accordance with IDF orders and the law\".",
      "Omar and Mr Mushtaha said they were then transferred to Ketziot prison, where they described a \"welcoming ceremony\" of beatings and other abuse.",
      "Omar said he witnessed sexual assault at Ketziot.",
      "\"They took the clothes off some of the guys and would do shameful acts\u2026 They forced guys to perform sex acts on each other. I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't penetrative sex. He would tell one guy to suck another guy. It was obligatory.\"",
      "The BBC did not receive any other reports of this nature, but the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which tracks conditions of Palestinians in Israeli jails, described sexual abuse of detainees held in Ketziot as a \"common occurrence\". This ranged from rape and sexual harassment to the beatings of genitals, it said.",
      "The group said that while it had not received testimony of forced sexual acts between detainees, it had been told some had been made to look at each other naked and had been thrown on top of each other naked.",
      "A report by B'Tselem has also gathered allegations of sexual violence, including from one prisoner who said guards attempted to rape him with a carrot.",
      "The BBC put the allegation that prisoners were forced to perform sexual acts on each other to the Israel Prison Service (IPS). It replied that it was \"not aware\" of the sexual abuse claim or any of the other claims made about treatment and conditions at Ketziot and other prisons that the BBC had gathered.",
      "It said: \"IPS is a law enforcement organisation that operates according to the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the state comptroller and many other official critiques.",
      "\"All prisoners are detained according to the law. All basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards. We are not aware of the claims you described and, as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.",
      "\"Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\"",
      "Omar said they were also hit with batons at Ketziot prison.",
      "\"After we got tortured, I was in pain all night - from my back to my legs. The guys would carry me from my mattress to the toilet. My body, my back, my legs - my whole body was blue from beatings. For nearly two months I couldn't move.\"",
      "Mr Mushtaha described having his head slammed into a door, and his genitals hit.",
      "\"They would strip us naked. They would Taser us. They would hit us in a sensitive place. They would tell us 'We will castrate you',\" he said.",
      "He said beatings were \"meant to break your bones\", and that detainees would sometimes be grouped together and have hot water poured over them.",
      "\"The amount of torture was enormous,\" he added.",
      "Both he and Omar also described incidents of what they said amounted to medical negligence.",
      "\"My hands were all blisters and swollen,\" said Mr Mushtaha.",
      "\"If people could have seen my legs they would have said they needed to be amputated from the inflammation\u2026 [Guards] would just tell me to wash my hands and legs with water and soap.",
      "\"But how was I meant to do this, when there was only water for one hour a day [between us], and as for soap, every week they would bring [only] a spoon of shampoo,\" he added.",
      "Mr Mushtaha said he was told by guards that: \"As long as you have a pulse you are in good shape. As long as you are standing, you're in good shape. When your pulse is gone, we will come to treat you.\"",
      "A report by a lawyer who visited both Mr Mushtaha and Omar in Ketziot last September said of Mr Mushtaha: \"The prisoner, like the rest of the prisoners, suffers from pain due to boils on his hands, feet and buttocks, and there is no cleanliness and he is not provided with any kind of treatment.\"",
      "Mr Mushtaha also provided the BBC with a report compiled by a doctor in Gaza, which confirmed he was still infected with scabies on the day of his release.",
      "Omar said detainees were beaten for requesting medical care.",
      "The lawyer noted that Omar needed attention for \"pimples spreading on the skin - in the groin and buttocks due to the harsh prison conditions\" including lack of toiletries and polluted water. \"The prisoner says that even when it is his turn to shower he tries to avoid it because the water\u2026 causes itching and inflammation.\"",
      "All the detainees added they had been given limited access to food and water while in detention at various facilities - several reported losing significant amounts of weight.",
      "Omar said he lost 30kg (4st 10lb). The lawyer said Omar told him food was \"almost non-existent\" in the first few months, though conditions later \"improved a little\".",
      "Mr Mushtaha described food there being left outside their caged compounds for cats and birds to eat from first.",
      "Another of our interviewees, Ahmed Abu Seif, said he was taken to a different prison - Megiddo, near the occupied West Bank, after being arrested on his 17th birthday.",
      "He said Israeli authorities would regularly storm their cells there and spray them with tear gas.",
      "\"We would feel suffocated and unable to breathe well for four days after each tear gas attack,\" according to Ahmed, who said he had been held in the prison's youth wing.",
      "\"There was no consideration of us being children, they treated us like the militants of 7 October.\"",
      "During interrogations he had his nails pulled out, he told us. When the BBC filmed him the day after his release, he showed us how several of his toenails were still affected, as well as scars on his hands he said had been caused by handcuffs and dog scratches.",
      "The IPS did not respond to this allegation.",
      "Two of the men said they had witnessed the deaths of fellow detainees in Sde Teiman and Ketziot - one through beatings, including the use of dogs, and one through medical negligence.",
      "The names and dates they gave of the incidents match media reports and accounts from human rights groups.",
      "At least 63 Palestinian prisoners - 40 of them from Gaza - have died in Israeli custody since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian Prisoners Society told the BBC.",
      "The IPS did not respond to questions about deaths of Palestinians in custody, while the IDF said it was \"aware of cases of detainee deaths, including those who were detained with pre-existing illness or injury resulting from combat\".",
      "\"According to procedures, an investigation is opened by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) into every detainee death,\" it added.",
      "The abuse continued right up to the moment they were freed in February, some of the men said.",
      "\"On the release day, they treated us brutally. They tightened the handcuffs and when they wanted to make us move they put our hands above our heads and pulled us,\" Mr Mushtaha said.",
      "\"They said: 'If you interact with Hamas or work with Hamas, you will be targeted.' They said: 'We will send a missile directly to you.'\"",
      "Ahmed, 17, also said conditions worsened after the ceasefire deal was signed in January. \"The soldiers intensified the aggression against us knowing we were getting released soon.\"",
      "It was only once the detainees were transferred to the Red Cross bus for transportation back to Gaza that they felt \"safe\", Omar said.",

      "The two neighbouring Caucasus countries have agreed the text of a historic peace deal to end decades long conflict over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, but Vardanyan and 15 other former ethnic Armenian leaders are not part of the agreement.",
      "They are on trial in a military court in Baku, accused of war crimes dating back decades.",
      "Vardanyan, a 56-year-old Russian-Armenian entrepreneur, is facing 42 charges including planning and waging war, mercenary activities and terrorism.",
      "A picture of him in court appeared to show bruises on his forehead and there have been allegations of torture, denied by Azerbaijan which insists his rights have been respected in custody.",
      "It marks a dramatic downfall for a man who made his fortune in Russia and once rubbed shoulders with celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney.",
      "He set up Russia's first investment bank back in the early 1990s, and as founder of the country's prestigious business management school \"Skolkovo\" he enjoyed the reputation of a progressive visionary, a Western-friendly voice in Russia's business community in the 2000's.",

    "story": [
      "Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.",
      "Contestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos - with very few choosing the natural look.",
      "In more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marl\u00e8ne-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022 - looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.",
      "Her victory was not only unusual in Ivory Coast but across the world, where Western beauty standards are often the desired look both for those entering contests and for the judges.",
      "Changes are slowly creeping in - last December Ang\u00e9lique Angarni-Filopon, from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, made headlines when she was crowned Miss France, mainly because of her age - she is 34 - and she also sported short Afro hair.",
      "But this year the organisers of the Ivorian competition are shaking things up right from the start.",
      "Wigs, weaves and hair extensions have been banned from the preliminary stages of the competition, which are held in 13 cities across the country (as well as two abroad for those in the diaspora).",
      "\"We want the candidates to be natural - whether with braids or straightened hair, it should be their own. Beauty must be raw,\" Victor Yapobi, president of the Miss Ivory Coast organising committee, told the BBC.",
      "Ivory Coast is the only African country enforcing the ban for a national competition.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look - for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.",
      "\"We decided this year to truly showcase the natural beauty of these young women,\" he said.",
      "Other changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete - the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and - crucially - lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (\u00a325) to $50.",
      "\"This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.\"",
      "When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.",
      "\"I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,\" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.",
      "\"This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.\"",
      "The move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.",
      "As a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called \"protective style\", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.",
      "This was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.",
      "\"I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,\" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.",
      "\"I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.\"",
      "The new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.",
      "\"Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,\" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.",
      "\"This year, I feel more confident being myself.\"",
      "Should the competition influence attitudes beyond the pageant world, it could have huge economic implications.",
      "Wigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.",
      "Ivory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.",
      "\"This rule is not good for us,\" Ange Sea, a 30-year-old hairdresser in Daloa, told the BBC.",
      "\"Many women love wigs. This will hurt our business and we make more money when working with wigs and weaves.\"",
      "At her salon, glue will be used to carefully attach wigs to make them look more natural and women will spend hours having weaves and extensions put in.",
      "It shows how deeply engrained wig culture is in West Africa, despite a natural hair movement that has been gaining momentum among black women around the world over the last decade.",
      "Natural hair products have become much more readily available and natural hair influencers proliferate on social media worldwide with advice on how to manage and style natural hair, which can be time-consuming.",
      "It used to be considered unprofessional to wear one's hair naturally and it would have been extraordinary to see black female TV stars on screen or CEOs in the boardroom with natural hair.",
      "According to Florence Edwige Nanga, a hair and scalp specialist in the main Ivorian city of Abidjan, this is often still the case in Ivory Coast.",
      "\"Turn on the TV [here], and you'll see almost every journalist wearing a wig,\" the trichologist told the BBC.",
      "\"These beauty enhancements are fashionable, but they can also cause problems - like alopecia or scalp infections,\" she warned.",
      "With the preliminary rounds under way, arguments over whether pageants should be setting beauty rules or women should decide such things for themselves continues.",
      "The outcome may be that there is more of an acceptance of both in Ivory Coast, allowing women to switch styles up - between natural hair and wigs and weaves.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the feedback he had received over the new rules was \"extraordinary\" and clearly showed it was having an impact.",
      "\"Everyone congratulates us. Everyone, even from abroad. I receive emails and WhatsApp messages from everywhere congratulating us for wanting to return to our roots.\"",
      "He said no decision had been taken about whether the wig ban would apply to the 15 contestants who make it to the final of Miss Ivory Coast 2025.",
      "This extravaganza will take place at a hotel in Abidjan at the end of June and will be broadcast on national TV.",
      "\"If it works, we'll continue and carry on this initiative in the years to come,\" Mr Yapobi said.",
      "For Doria Kor\u00e9, who went on to be named Miss Haut-Sassandra, her crown holds even more significance: \"Winning with natural hair shows the true beauty of African women.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 00:21:21 GMT",
    "summary": "Gangetic and Indus river dolphins are found in over two-dozen rivers in India.",
    "story": [
      "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.",
      "But these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.",
      "These are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.",
      "A new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.",
      "Both these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
      "Researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins.",
      "The origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists.",
      "When the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.",
      "Experts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.",
      "Conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.",
      "In 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.",
      "However, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.",
      "Dolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.",
      "Nachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble.",
      "Under Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines.",
      "River cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.",
      "\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.",
      "Mr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.",
      "River dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.",
      "Their poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.",
      "But Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says."

      "Donald Trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on US imports on Wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 April as America's \"liberation day\".",
      "After two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the president's second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality.",
      "US stocks have been in a tailspin since Trump unveiled his tariffs at Wednesday afternoon's White House Rose Garden event, with signs that America's trading partners - Canada, the European Union and China, most notably - are not backing away from a fight.",

      "Meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days.",
      "The White House on Thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. The four big posters showing America's \"reciprocal\" tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between.",
      "Out on Pennsylvania Avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the White House grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-Trump demonstration at the nearby Washington Monument on Saturday. The first lady announced that a White House garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day had been postponed because of security concerns.",
      "Even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the Marine One helicopter on the first leg of his journey to Florida.",
      "\"I said this would be exactly the way it is,\" he declared when asked about the day's stock market turmoil. The markets - and America as a whole - would soon boom, he said.",
      "The president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. He appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich American manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right.",

      "Evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to Jake Sullivan, who was President Joe Biden's national security adviser.",
      "In an interview with the BBC, he accused Trump of handing Russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change.",
      "\"So the current dynamic in these negotiations a) is not in fact producing Russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b) is actually stimulating a view in Moscow that if they just keep holding out, they're just going to keep getting concessions from the United States.

      "Other court challenges - to Trump's suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 Venezuelans - are currently working their way through the US legal system.",
      "At some point, the US Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes.",
      "This week also marked the biggest round of elections since Trump's November 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in Wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two Florida special elections for seats in the House of Representatives.",
      "While the Republican candidates in Florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15%, which is about half of what Trump posted in those congressional districts in November.",
      "In Wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the Democratic-backed candidate won. Democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned there in person.",
      "Taken as a whole the results suggest that Democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against Musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff.",
      "That could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this November and the midterm congressional elections next year.",
      "The stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within Republican ranks.",
      "Ted Cruz, an arch-conservative senator from Texas, said on his podcast on Friday that Trump's tariffs \"could hurt jobs and could hurt America\" - particularly if other nations retaliate, as China has already done.",
      "\"If we're in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive American tariffs, and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on Earth, that is a terrible outcome,\" he continued.",
      "On Wednesday night in the US Senate, four Republicans joined with Democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies Trump's earlier Canada tariffs.",
      "And on Thursday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa joined with Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington to back a measure that would require Congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days.",
      "Republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. They seem unwilling, or unable, to sway Trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vice-like grip on the party.",
      "But if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if Trump's standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years.",
      "And that would bring an unceremonious end to some of Trump's most ambitious efforts.",
      "Trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end."

    "summary": "The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes.",
    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",

      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

On home soil in Turkey, he has been beaten by the police several times while taking pictures, he says - including on World Peace Day \u2013 and has been detained \"so many times\".",
      "But being arrested at home was a first.",
      "\"A chill fell over the house,\" he tells us. \"In my work, at the protests, I have seen a lot of violence, and tear gas, but having the police in my home, I felt more afraid.\"",

      "The authorities had banned the protests but had been unable to stop them.",
      "Akgul is facing charges of \"taking part in illegal rallies and marches\". He says the aim is clear \u2013 to stop others taking pictures of the biggest unrest in Turkey in more than a decade.",

They are making other journalists afraid that if they go back into the field, they could face the same thing.\"  The fact that he works for an international news agency, AFP, makes that message even louder, he believes.",

    "summary": "What impact will the introduction of hefty tariffs on countries in Asia have on Nike's iconic US trainer?",
    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "How does it affect me if share prices fall?",
      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",
      "But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.",
      "\"Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs.\"",
      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",
      "That includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".",
      "Matt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it \"difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US\".",
      "Mr Powers added: \"This transition, if pursued, would take years and require significant investment.\"",

    "story": [
      "South Korea's president has been removed from office after the Constitutional Court voted unanimously to uphold his impeachment.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duty in December after being impeached by parliament, following his failed attempt to impose martial law.",
      "The ruling on Friday was met with tears of joy and sadness among Yoon's critics and supporters, who had gathered in various parts of Seoul to watch the verdict live.",
      "A snap election to vote for Yoon's replacement must be held by 3 June.",
      "What next for South Korea?",
      "After months of anxiously waiting, South Koreans have some badly needed closure. The country can now start to repair and move forward, the first step being to elect a new leader.",
      "But the crisis Yoon has unleashed is far from over. Although his military takeover only lasted six hours, the political fallout has only intensified with each month that has passed.",
      "The night of 3 December, when Yoon ordered troops to storm parliament, changed something in South Korea's psyche. It reawakened the ghosts of the country's violent, dictatorial past, showing people that martial law was not, as most had assumed, consigned to history.",
      "Many are still upset by what happened that night, and afraid that the threat of martial law could be brandished again by future zealous politicians.",
      "Today's verdict therefore came as a relief to most, who cheered on the streets of Seoul as the verdict was read out. It is a victory for South Korea's democracy, that for a while looked as if it was on dangerous ground.",
      "The Constitutional Court was damning in its criticism of Yoon's authoritarian power grab, as all eight judges voted to remove him from office.",
      "Moon Hyung-bae, acting president of the bench, said Yoon's short-lived military takeover was not justified, and that he had \"[gone] against the people he was supposed to protect\".",
      "He added that the implementation of martial law \"damaged people's basic political rights\" and \"violated the principles of the rule of law and democracy\".",
      "Already, there are serious calls to change South Korea's constitution \u2013 to strengthen its institutions and limit the powers of the president - to guard against this happening again. However, it will take a particularly patriotic future president to sign off on reducing their own authority.",
      "South Korea more polarised than ever",
      "As Yoon leaves office, he leaves behind not just a shaken country, but a divided one. In the aftermath of that shocking December night, South Koreans were mostly united in their disgust for the president and what he had attempted to do.",
      "But Yoon showed no remorse. He dug in, fought his trial at every step, and continued to dangle the same unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that he used to justify his military takeover.",
      "He claimed that the country and his political opposition had been infiltrated by North Korean and Chinese spies, and that these \"anti-state forces\" had rigged past elections.",
      "Gradually more and more people believed him. To them Yoon is now a political martyr \u2013 the victim of an establishment that had been overrun by \"communists\".",
      "His conspiracy theories have firmly taken root, and far-right extremism is flourishing. Thousands protest every week in the centre of Seoul. They were on the streets on Friday, and will be there again Saturday, claiming the country's politicians and judges are corrupt and elections are rigged.",
      "And these are not fringe views.",
      "More than a third of people now say they do not trust the Constitutional Court which delivered Yoon's verdict; more than a quarter do not trust the voting system.",
      "Within this climate of distrust, South Korea must head to the polls. Yoon's successor needs to be chosen in the next 60 days. These days are sure to be fraught and even more divisive. Many may not accept the result that comes.",
      "Yet South Korea urgently needs a new leader who can advocate for the country as a whole, having been without one for months.",
      "It quickly needs to figure out how to deal with President Trump, having started on the backfoot. His 25% tariffs on cars and steel have dealt Seoul, and its ailing economy, an early a blow, but many believe worse is coming; that it is only time until Trump turns his gaze to the Korean peninsula, and when he does he will try to force South Korea to pay more for its defence and cut a deal with Seoul's arch enemy, Kim Jong Un.",
      "Yoon's legal team has accused the court of politicising the ruling.",
      "\"The whole process of this trial itself was not lawful and unfair,\" said one of his lawyers, Yoon Gap-geun.",
      "\"I feel regrettable that this completely is a political decision,\" he said.",
      "But politicians are calling for unity, asking everyone to accept the verdict, so South Korea can start to move on.",
      "Yoon's political party, the PPP, has conceded, but Yoon himself has not. In a statement he apologised to his supporters for his \"shortcomings\" without mentioning the ruling.",
      "\"I am truly sorry and regretful that I could not live up to your expectations,\" he said.",
      "\"It has been a great honor to serve the Republic of Korea. I am deeply grateful to all of you who supported and encouraged me, despite my many shortcomings,\" he said.",
      "He cannot appeal, as the decision was made by South Korea's top court. But, having repeatedly vowed to fight to the end, he could still refuse to go quietly.",

      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's impeached president?",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In an unprecedented televised announcement on 3 December, Yoon said he was invoking martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea.",
      "At the time, the embattled leader was in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and several of his cabinet ministers were under investigation.",
      "Less than two hours after Yoon's declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon's party, voted to overturn it.",
      "Yoon was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on 14 December.",
      "He is also facing separate charges for insurrection - making him South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged with a crime - which he will be trialed for at a later date. He is now on bail.",
      "Yoon is not the only South Korean politician to have faced impeachment in recent months.",

And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.",
      "Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.",
      "For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.",
      "\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"",

      "It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.",

      "The Clinton-era law, which in the current climate is beginning to feel like a relic of a bygone time, was up for renewal later this year.",
      "Since 2000, certain African countries had duty-free access to the US market for a raft of goods including clothing and textiles, cocoa products and wine, as well as crude oil.",
      "The access was tied to a number of conditions including free market policies, labour and human rights and political pluralism. Thirty-two countries from sub-Saharan Africa were eligible as of last year.",

      "But, as witnessed with the aid cuts, arguing about the human impact or fairness will not fly in the current set-up, in the face of \"disruptive populism and post-fact, post-truth society\", Dr Kituyi argues.",
      "He thinks countries, like Kenya, that have the new tariffs set at 10% could still try to hold ground in the US market, with the exporters and their American importers negotiating how to absorb the new taxes without raising prices for the consumer too much.",
      "As Dr Kituyi was involved in trade negotiations, including Agoa, he has seen first-hand the effort that goes into \"fine-tuning these processes\" to create a \"shared benefit from stable, predictable rules-based trading\".",

      "\"It looks like a withdrawal, an ignoring of an entire huge region of the world,\" Ms Gavin says.",
      "Coming shortly after the Trump administration severely pared back the US Agency for International Development, leading to the cancelation of both humanitarian and life-saving health assistance, the analyst says America appears to be \"destroying its own instruments of influence with abandon now\".",

      "There has in the past been bipartisan support for it among American legislators, and Dr Kituyi sees this as \"a glimmer of hope\".",
      "A bill seeking a renewal of Agoa until 2041 was released by Democrat Senator Chris Coons over a year ago, but it may not make any progress in the current Congress.",
      "Ms Gavin does not believe that Agoa is now a priority given the global upheaval Trump's drastic and unpredictable policy shifts have created.",
      "\"I think a non-reciprocal trade agreement is a very tough sell for this Congress, which is dominated by the Republican Party that has thus far been quite accommodating of the administration's agenda.\"",
      "She believes that while it \"makes good sense as a matter of policy,\" it is unlikely to be front and centre of legislators' agenda \"as a matter of politics\" even if Congress starts to assert itself more.",
      "As Trump's tariffs throw the world into turmoil, the specific needs of the continent are unlikely to be uppermost for others around the world.",
      "If Agoa does become defunct, Africa will have to look within itself and make good on the promises of creating a continental free-trade area. It will also have to work harder to find new trading partners or expand existing markets.",

    "summary": "Israeli air strikes on bases in Syria are a warning to Turkey to keep its military assets away.",
    "story": [
      "A growing confrontation between Israel and Turkey over influence in Syria is posing a serious challenge for Syria's fragile new government.",
      "On Wednesday night, Israel bombed several military targets in Syria, including two airports \u2013 Hama military airport and the T4 base near Homs.",
      "Syria's foreign ministry said the bombardment virtually destroyed the Hama base.  A prominent Syrian human rights group said four defence ministry employees were killed, and a dozen other people injured.",
      "The air strikes hit Syria, but their real target was Turkey.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Israel's foreign minister accused Turkey of playing a \"negative role\" in Syria, and Israel's defence minister warned Syria's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, that he would \"pay a very heavy price\" if he allowed \"hostile forces\" to enter his country.",
      "Ankara is currently negotiating a joint defence pact with Sharaa's new government, and there have been widespread reports that Turkey is moving to station aircraft and air defence systems at Syria's T4 and Aleppo airbases.",
      "Some analysts compared Israel's intense air strikes on Hama airport this week with the much lighter bombing on the edge of the T4 base, suggesting that Turkey may have already moved some equipment there and that Israel was calibrating its attack to avoid a full-blown escalation.",
      "Relations between Israel and Turkey have nose-dived since the Gaza war began in October 2023, with Ankara introducing trade restrictions and accusing Israel of genocide.",
      "That regional tension is now playing out on new ground in Syria.",
      "After the air strikes on Wednesday, Turkey's foreign ministry accused Israel of destabilising the region by \"both causing chaos and feeding terrorism\" and said it was now the greatest threat to the security of the region.",
      "But foreign minister Hakan Fidan told Reuters news agency that his country was not seeking confrontation with Israel, and that Syria could set its own policies with its southern neighbour.",
      "Syria's new leader has repeatedly signalled that he was not looking for confrontation with Israel.  Soon after sweeping President Bashar al-Assad from power last December, he told the BBC that Syria would not pose a threat to any country.",
      "He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.",
      "His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.",
      "But Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.",
      "Once an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.",
      "Since he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.",
      "It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.",
      "Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.",
      "Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.",
      "Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.",
      "Since then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.",
      "Charles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".",
      "Since the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria and the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".",
      "Many Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.",
      "Some say that view is now changing.",
      "\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"",
      "Syria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.",
      "At least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.",
      "Those former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.",
      "Syrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.",
      "But outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27lg8vp41o",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 23:06:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Could the National Rally retaliate in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Andrew read this article",
      "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "The airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.",
      "\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.",
      "But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.",
      "Le Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.",
      "\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",
      "As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.",
      "No clear frontrunner for president",
      "Nervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.",
      "But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.",
      "An early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust.",
      "Tellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.",
      "In other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.",
      "And remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.",
      "Emmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.",
      "Le Pen's crime and punishment",
      "Anyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.",
      "The evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.",
      "That the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.",
      "Regarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case.",
      "Had they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.",
      "\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.",
      "They berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".",
      "Hypocrisy among the elite",
      "It is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.",
      "That toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.",
      "Le Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.",
      "\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.",
      "Reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.",
      "At least not yet.",
      "Future of France's far right",
      "So where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?",
      "The short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.",
      "The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.",
      "One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.",
      "If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration.",
      "But turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.",
      "The Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.",
      "Meanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.",
      "But this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.",
      "\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.",
      "It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.",
      "To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?",
      "As for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?",
      "France has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.",
      "History may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.",

    "summary": "Big in Asia, live shopping involves brands putting on live shows to sell direct to shoppers.",
    "story": [
      "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.",
      "She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.",
      "But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.",
      "She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.",
      "\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"",
      "Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773).",
      "Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.",
      "\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.",
      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",
      "Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.",
      "It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.",
      "A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.",
      "Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.",
      "\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\"",
      "He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.",
      "However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.",
      "\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.",
      "\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.",
      "\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.",
      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",
      "\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.",
      "Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.",
      "Nordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.",
      "\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"",
      "For some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.",
      "High-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.",
      "Oman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.",
      "The firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want.",
      "\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

      "When we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.",
      "Ireland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.",
      "Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports.",
      "Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods.",
      "Germany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.",
      "Will the EU retaliate?",
      "The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members.",

      "But the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP.",
      "So, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.",

      "Tricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US.",
      "Think of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.",

      "The Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?",
      "Trump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).",
      "It's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.",
      "To redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.",
      "But that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.",
      "Brussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.",
      "It would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.",
      "How bad can this all get?",
      "How do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.",
      "European firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere.",
      "The risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.",
      "Would the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?",
      "These are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.",
      "Which is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market.",
      "Those barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness.",
      "The IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.",
      "That is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump.",
      "EU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market."

      "\"Hey, Mr. Wilson!\"\u00a0\u00a0Jay North (Aug. 3, 1951-April 6, 2025), who began appearing on kids' TV shows when he was 5, had already played small roles on \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" when he was cast, at age 6, as the bright-eyed troublemaker in the TV adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip \"Dennis the Menace.\" The series ran on CBS for four years beginning in 1959, but Dennis continued to strike terror in the heart of his elderly neighbor, George Wilson, for years after in syndication.",
      "The stardom came at a cost to the child. He told the Los Angeles Daily News in 1993 that he had been abused by his aunt and uncle, who would be with him on set while North's single mom was at work. \"If it took me more than one or two takes, I would be threatened and then whacked,\" North said.",
      "His other TV and film credits in the 1960s and early '70s included \"Wagon Train,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"Maya,\" and voice work for \"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" and \"The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show.\"",
      "After appearing on stage in \"Butterflies Are Free,\" North had a brief stint in the Navy in the 1970s, and tried to return to show business with more mature, darker roles. Aside from a 1985 Yugoslavian World War II film, \"Wild Wind,\" North's appearances were mostly playing off his child actor past. He satirized his Dennis the Menace role on HBO's \"Not Necessarily the News,\" and played himself in a 1999 episode of \"The Simpsons\" and the David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\"",
      "He also helped counsel other child and former child actors through the nonprofit organization A Minor Consideration."

      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

      "A pair of critically endangered, nearly 100-year-old Galapagos tortoises at the Philadelphia Zoo have become first-time parents.",
      "In an announcement Friday, the zoo said it is \"overjoyed\" at the arrival of the four hatchlings, a first in its more than 150-year history. The babies are the offspring of female Mommy and male Abrazzo, the zoo's two oldest residents.",
      "The quartet is being kept behind the scenes inside the Reptile and Amphibian House for now, \"eating and growing appropriately,\" the zoo said. They weigh between 70 and 80 grams, about the weight of a chicken egg. The first egg hatched on Feb. 27, and more that still could hatch are being monitored by the zoo's animal care team.",

    "summary": "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2.",
    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

    "story": [
      "Val Kilmer, the acclaimed, brooding actor who starred in a string of blockbuster hits in the 1980s and 1990s, has died at the age of 65.",
      "Kilmer died Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, his daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Val Kilmer died from pneumonia. He had recovered after a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required two tracheotomies.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Kilmer's death.",
      "A unique talent, Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable. Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",
      "His last major film credit was in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which he reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.",
      "Toward the end of \"Val,\" the 2021 documentary on his career, Kilmer said, \"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",
      "His movie career hit its zenith in the early 1990s as he made a name for himself as a dashing leading man, starring alongside Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton in \"Tombstone,\" as Elvis' ghost in \"True Romance\" and as a bank-robbing demolition expert in Mann's film \"Heat\" with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir. He agreed after being promised that his role would improve from the initial script.",
      "Kilmer vs. the Batman costume",
      "One career nadir when he played Batman in Joel Schumacher's goofy, garish \"Batman Forever\" with Nicole Kidman and opposite Chris O'Donnell's Robin - before George Clooney took up the mantle for 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" and after Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight in 1989's \"Batman\" and 1992's \"Batman Returns.\"",
      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",

    "summary": "The redeployment comes after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak in Texas.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

      "As of the latest CDC update on Friday, April 4, the U.S. has confirmed at least 607 measles cases so far this year, which is more than double the number of cases it saw in all of 2024. There have been cases in at least 21 states, including Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico and New York. The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as state health departments and the CDC continue to release data. This map is updated with new data from the CDC on Fridays.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has delivered a tepid message on the importance of vaccination against measles, saying it should be encouraged while also sowing doubt in the vaccine's safety. He is expected to launch a Make America Healthy Again tour across the southwestern U.S. early this week.",
      "Sunday, Kennedy said in a post on X that \"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration's former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\"This is the epitome of an absolutely needless death,\" Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \"These kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that's how you prevent people from dying of measles.\"",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn't mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak. Kennedy has been called to testify before the Senate health committee on Thursday.",

      "The death of a second unvaccinated child with measles in West Texas has doctors in North Texas, like Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, the Children's Medical Center Plano director for infection prevention and control, on high alert.",
      "\"Measles, as we know, it's a preventable disease. Unfortunately, a majority of the cases that we're seeing right now in the outbreak are in unvaccinated people,\" Garcia Carreno said.",

      "\"They need to be seen, and it's very important to try to get the test as early as possible and isolate those people that are suspected to have the measles or have the measles,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Garcia Carreno   said to check your medical records to see if you've gotten the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. You can get a blood test if you can't find your vaccine history. The blood test checks for measles antibodies.",
      "\"We do need to have a population that is immune against measles,\" Garcia Carreno said. \"At least 95% of the population needs to be protected, either immune because of the vaccination or because they have a history of having had the infection.\"",

      "\"Unvaccinated adults can receive the vaccine with doses at least 28 days apart,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "About 20%of unvaccinated children who get measles may need to be hospitalized, and between one to three cases in every 1,000 is fatal.",

Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",
      "Officials had planned the exercise for 40 laboratories across the FDA-backed Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, as well as additional government-backed and private labs, which are using different methods to test for the virus.",

      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",

      "President Trump has vehemently defended the sweeping tariffs unveiled by his administration on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, even as they threaten to spark a global trade war and have sent\u00a0stock markets tumbling around the world.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",

      "In addition to the baseline tax, Mr. Trump had said China would face a \"reciprocal\" levy of 34%, and in response to Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, the president has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China if it does not lift those duties by Tuesday.",
      "As markets fall, and with his\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "No pause in tariffs",
      "During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "The president also said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "Stocks plummeted last week after Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% global duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries. The new trade measures sent markets into a tailspin, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording their biggest two-day drop since March 2020.",
      "Overseas stock markets also suffered steep losses Monday, continuing their skid from last week.

    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on about 90 countries, including China and the European Union. Here's the list.",
    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated last week by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products. On April 7, Mr. Trump shot back at China by saying he plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to add retaliatory import duties.",
      "If Mr. Trump carries through with that threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",

Other Wall Street leaders are also starting to express tariff-related concerns, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.",
      "While many corporate leaders have been notably silent around Mr. Trump's trade policies, Wall Street executives this week spoke critically of the Trump administration's range of tariffs, some of which went into effect over the weekend, following the loss of trillions of value in last week's stock market rout.",
      "In his annual\u00a0letter to shareholders Monday, Dimon warned that Mr. Trump's \"tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.\" Dimon's remarks come after he said in January that Americans should \"get over\" concerns about the effects of tariffs.",
      "Dimon, who heads the largest U.S. bank, added in his shareholder letter that while the economy is weakening, stock market \"prices remain relatively high.\" While Dimon did not criticize Mr. Trump directly, he noted that the tariffs would have \"short-term effects\" including anticipated higher prices on both domestic and imported goods.",
      "Such conditions could lead to what's known as stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 which describes economic periods when growth slows even as prices remain painfully high. Inflation typically eases when the economy contracts.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" Dimon said.",
      "He said potential retaliatory actions by other nations are weighing on confidence, and said unequivocally that the \"quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.\"",
      "\"Economic nuclear war\"",
      "A chorus of other high-profile Wall Street executives echoed Dimon's remarks, with some sharply criticizing the White House's recent tariff actions. Many corporate leaders have thus far been reluctant to openly criticize the Trump Administration's agenda.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said on X Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "Ackman said that the\u00a0reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on dozens of countries April 9 would be tantamount launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"",
      "As a result, \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he said.",
      "He took aim at Mr. Trump directly, saying \"The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe\" and that if he doesn't pause the tariffs from going into effect, the U.S. is headed for a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\"",

    "story": [
      "Some of the new tariffs announced by President Trump earlier this week went into effect Saturday, triggering customs agents' collections at ports of entry across the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, urged Americans to \"hang tough,\" calling the implementation of tariffs an \"economic revolution.\"",
      "\"We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,\" he said, adding, \"It won't be easy but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump unveiled two new tariffs \u2013 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called reciprocal tariffs applied to imports from about 90 nations. He said they would revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "Countries targeted by Mr. Trump for higher tariffs are due to go into effect on Wednesday. Those include assessments as high as 50% for Lesotho, 49% for Cambodia and 47% for Madagascar.",

    "story": [
      "Financial markets landed with a thud Friday as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war.",
      "President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies \u2014 which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries \u2014 are likely to dent the economy.",
      "\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell\u00a0said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 \u2014 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%. Today's plunge erased $2.7 trillion in market value from the index. The decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the S&P 500 back to its levels in February 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",
      "\"The economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs [is] hard to describe and can essentially take the U.S. tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead,\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a report.",
      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In more upbeat news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",

    "summary": "As world leaders wrung their hands over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcements, Argentine president Javier Milei was feted at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

      "When announcing his latest round of tariffs on April 2, President Trump veered into the subject of eggs, noting that prices \"dropped now 59%, and they're going down more, and the availability is fantastic.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 or the price paid by large buyers like grocery stores \u2014 have declined 43% since year start, with much of the decline occurring since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While retail data for March isn't yet available, grocery stores tell CBS MoneyWatch that lower prices are now starting to trickle down to consumers, and that there should be plenty of eggs available for Easter and Passover later this month.",
      "Lower egg prices may represent a bright point for consumers at a time when inflation remains sticky, and\u00a0may reignite\u00a0this year due Mr. Trump's tariffs, economists say. The new levies are set to hit all imports from food products to automobiles. Egg prices have declined partly due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's five-point plan to tackle the issue, which includes battling the bird flu and importing eggs\u00a0from nations including Turkey and South Korea.",
      "Egg prices at Northeast grocery chain Stew Leonard's have declined recently, with conventional eggs now down to to about $5.99 a dozen from $10 a dozen at their peak in December, said Andrew Hollis, director of sales.",
      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",
      "Walmart, one of the nation's biggest grocers, also said that its egg prices have declined in recent weeks, although it didn't specify the decline. A dozen eggs are retailing for about $5 a dozen, according to Walmart's website.",

The nations will face tariffs of 10% and 25%, respectively. Those taxes are likely to be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival.

    "summary": "U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says the Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth, and the Federal Reserve will focus on keeping price increases temporary, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.",
      "The Fed chair's remarks come two days after Trump unveiled\u00a0sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging, with investors nervously watching as key trading partners retaliate. China on Friday said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, the day after Mr. Trump's new tariffs go into effect.",
      "In written remarks delivered in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said that the tariffs and their impacts on the economy and inflation are \"significantly larger than expected.\" He also said that the import taxes are \"highly likely\" to lead to \"at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" but added that \"it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said. \"Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" he added.",
      "Powell's focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months. That is likely to disappoint Wall Street investors, who now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, urged Powell to cut rates, writing that now would be the \"PERFECT time\" to do it. The president went on to criticize the Fed chair as \"always 'late,'\" adding that \"he could now change his image, and quickly.\"",
      "Economists forecast that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged \u2014 or even hike them \u2014 to combat inflation. Powell's comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.",
      "\"At the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices,\" said Powell. \"While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2% objective.\"",
      "Tricky combination",
      "Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates \u2014 or keep them elevated \u2014 to slow spending and combat inflation.",
      "\"We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data,\" said Powell. \"As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\"",
      "Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with\u00a0228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.",
      "Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses' willingess to invest and hire.",
      "\"The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.",

    "summary": "Economists say that President Trump's wide-ranging new tariffs raise the risk of a recession or stagflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is promising that his April 2 \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0volley of tariffs will \"make America wealthy again\" by repatriating manufacturing jobs and reviving demand for American-made products. But many economists are taking a different view, warning that the tariffs could lead to more dire economic scenarios, including a recession or stagflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has said the two new tariffs he unveiled Wednesday \u2014 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0applied to imports from about 90 nations \u2014 will revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "But economists are ringing alarm bells as they digest the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs, which they forecast will accelerate inflation and dampen U.S. economic growth. That's because Mr. Trump's tariffs will be paid by U.S. businesses that import goods and materials from other countries, and they are likely to pass on some or all of those costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "As a result, experts say, inflation is likely to reignite, which could cause some U.S. households to back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70 cents of every $1 in GDP, economic growth could slow.",
      "Together, those outcomes could create \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters even as prices remain painfully high.",
      "The risks of recession\u00a0\u2014 a downturn that includes at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 are also rising due to Mr. Trump's latest tariffs, according to new estimates from several Wall Street economists.",
      "If the fresh U.S. tariffs spur retaliatory measures from other nations, \"serious recessions\" could emerge both in the U.S. and globally, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. A U.S. recession would likely reduce GDP by 2% and boost unemployment next year to 7.5%, up from its current rate of 4.1%, he estimated.",
      "On Friday, China announced it would implement a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports beginning April 10, a day after Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are slated to go into effect.",
      "Still, for now that scenario remains unlikely, with Zandi assigning it a 15% probability. If the Trump administration drops some tariffs and offers exemptions for some products or nations, a recession would be more mild, with unemployment topping out at 5.5%, he added. Zandi said he is giving a 35% probability to this outcome.",
      "To be sure, while many economists are raising the likelihood of a recession, they also say the economy remains relatively strong, with low unemployment and steady growth. Much depends on whether the Trump administration sticks with its tariffs or eases up on some policies.",
      "Brace for higher inflation",
      "More certain is that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. Consumer prices could accelerate by 1 percentage point by year-end, he added, which would boost the inflation rate close to 4% from its current level.",
      "That could prove painful for many Americans, including for supporters of Mr. Trump who backed his candidacy because of his promises to \"end the inflation nightmare\" of the post-pandemic years. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll,\u00a0 most Americans said the president has focused too much on\u00a0tariffs, which they fear could end up raising prices, and not enough on lowering consumer costs.",
      "A hike in inflation from Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs could add $1,000 in annual costs for low-income households, Daco estimated. Products ranging from Apple's iPhones, which are largely manufactured in China, to clothing made in Vietnam could spike in price due to the reciprocal tariffs, with those nations facing rates of 34% and 46%, respectively.",
      "However, other estimates predict a bigger hit to Americans' budgets, with the Yale Budget Lab forecasting that the April 2 tariffs will cost a typical household about $2,148.",
      "\"With the most significant tariff increases targeting countries central to the U.S. supply chain for consumer goods \u2014 China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Cambodia \u2014 households should expect higher prices across a wide range of everyday items,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.",
      "Here's what other top economists are predicting",
      "Oxford Economics: \"[T]he announced tariffs will significantly raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to slightly less than 30%, matching levels not seen since the 1930s .... Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model [forecasts] U.S. GDP growth at 1.4% and core inflation rising to 3.9% this year.\" \u2014Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist",
      "PNC Financial Services: \"The U.S. economy is in good shape at the start of the second quarter, but the ongoing trade war has increased the risk of near-term recession dramatically.\" \u2014Economist Ershang Liang",
      "Nationwide: \"[W]e revise down our real GDP growth estimate to a range of zero \u20130.5% Q4/Q4 2025 (previously we forecast 1% \u2013 1.5% growth, while significant retaliation by our trading partners could tip GDP growth negative and result in a recession.\" \u2014Chief economist Kathy Bostjancic",
      "Capital Economics: \"[W]e see U.S. GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% annualized, but the risks are to the downside and we would put the odds of a recession at about 30%. U.S. CPI inflation now looks set to jump to around 4.5% later this year.\" \u2014Its global economics team",
      "Deutsche Bank: \"[T]hese actions could potentially shave 1 - 1.5 [percentage points] from growth this year and add a broadly similar amount to core PCE inflation .... Recession risks will likely rise materially if these tariffs are sustained.\" \u2014Economics team",

That hemorrhaging of stock values continued in Asian and European markets Friday as China announced its retaliation \u2014 becoming the first country to do so since Mr. Trump made his announcement at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "China and other nations have voiced hope that new trade agreements with Washington can be struck, and they stress they will pursue negotiations that Mr. Trump has indicated an openness to, but even close allies such as the United Kingdom, which was hit with the minimum 10% base rate tariff on Wednesday, have also made clear that retaliatory measures remain under consideration.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 228,000 jobs in March, pointing to a labor market that remains resilient despite economic headwinds from President Trump's tariffs and sticky inflation.",
      "The numbers",

      "The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "What it means",
      "While the March numbers beat forecasts, economists are also cautioning that Mr. Trump's new tariffs, announced on April 2, could crimp economic growth, raising the risk of a recession. Economic downturns like recessions are typically accompanied by a sharp increase in unemployment.",
      "\"Today's better-than-expected jobs report will help ease fears of an immediate softening in the U.S. labor market.

      "Asian stocks fell further Friday, though markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the day's declines, The Associated Press reported. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8% while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%.",
      "European markets lost more ground, the AP said. Germany's DAX fell 2%. The CAC 40 in Paris was off 1.6%. And Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.7%.",

      "Souring sentiment",
      "Financial markets surged after Mr. Trump was re-elected in November, with Wall Street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. Other investors bet on the Trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce.",
      "But after hitting all-time highs in February, stocks have turned tail as the White House makes clear it wasn't bluffing. Indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In contrast to his first term, when he implemented levies on roughly $380 billion worth of goods over four years, Mr. Trump has imposed more than $3 trillion in tariffs in the less than three months since his return to power, according to the Economic Policy institute, a left-leaning think tank.",

      "Despite the angst on Wall Street, economists note that the U.S. continues to grow, and most still put relatively low odds on a recession. Hiring around the U.S. also remains healthy, with the nation's unemployment rate hovering around 4%.",
      "For borrowers, meanwhile, further signs the economy is at risk of stalling could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate. The central bank last cut rates in December of 2024, but has kept them steady since then as policy makers seek to douse inflation.",

      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

      "On Friday, users logged 54% more new car leads on Dealer.com, meaning they submitted inquiries to dealers about vehicles they were interested in buying. Auto Trader notched an uptick of 16% in used car leads.",
      "\"It makes a lot of sense; I would assume that people would have gotten started researching to see what things look like now,\" Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "More pressure on cost-conscious to buy now",
      "Car prices are likely to rise when tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"With Trump's 'Liberation Day' here it is becoming crystal clear this tariff/U.S. policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a U.S. consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. \"We stress that the concept of a U.S. car maker with parts all from the U.S. is a fictional tale that does not exist and would take years to make this concept a reality.\"",
      "By contrast, vehicles currently sitting on dealers' lots are insulated from the levies.",
      "\"If consumers are seeing prices on lots saying, 'here's the tariff adjustment cost,' they should challenge that, because sitting inventory is not subject to tariffs,\" Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief of Cars.com, a car buying marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch. He noted that existing inventory is relatively stable. \"There are vehicles to be had, we aren't seeing an inventory crunch right now.\"",
      "Indeed, McCabe said dealers are seeing increased interest in vehicles on lots from consumers, and \"are going to be more picky on their consumers to get the best price they can.\"",
      "Said McCabe, \"They know the supply and demand issue will change pretty quickly with the tariff impact.\"",
      "That's why his advice to consumers who need a new car is to start shopping now. \"If you need car and can afford it, get out there now,\" he said.",
      "In particular, motorists on the lower end of the income scale should consider making their car purchases immediately, he said, because any kind of price hike could push them out of the market for a vehicle altogether.",
      "\"There's a cost-conscious consumer that if you start tariffing them, they'll stop buying the vehicle because it doesn't fit in their budget,\" McCabe said.",

    "summary": "President Trump rolled out new tariffs on April 2 aimed at easing trade imbalances. Here's which products could become more expensive as a result.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation-weary Americans may soon find they're paying more for a host of products after President Trump announced two new types of tariffs on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day\" because he believes the measures will erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other nations.",
      "While Mr. Trump characterizes tariffs as paid by other nations, they are in fact paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart or Amazon. Because the tariffs create higher costs for those businesses, they typically pass on all or some of the tariffs to consumers through price hikes.",
      "The new tariffs introduced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday include a 10% universal tariff, as well as so-called reciprocal tariffs on more than 60 countries that are trade partners with the U.S. The tariffs will be additive, meaning that imports will face both the universal tariff of 10% plus the specific reciprocal import levies targeting each nation.",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump's said the tariffs will would eventually lower prices for Americans, an issue on which voters say they want him to focus. But economists are predicting instead that consumers and businesses will likely encounter higher inflation, with price hikes on everything from food imports like coffee and chocolate to iPhones and other electronics manufactured outside the U.S.",
      "\"For all of President Trump's talk of a new 'golden age,' this huge tax increase will inevitably result in higher prices for American families, lower growth and business investment, and diminished exports and manufacturing output as the country's factories face retaliation abroad and costlier inputs (roughly half of all imports) at home,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow, trade experts at the Cato Institute, in an email.",
      "They added, \"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression.\"",
      "The Trump administration said there are some exclusions to the tariffs, including semiconductors, pharmaceuticals and critical minerals, although it added that these products might be subject to tariffs at a later time.",
      "Which products will become more expensive with tariffs?",
      "Because of the 10% universal tariff on imports, any imported good is likely to become more expensive in the coming weeks and months as American companies digest the import duties and adjust their prices in response.",
      "For instance, after Mr. Trump added tariffs to imported washing machines during his first term, the median price of an appliance jumped more than 11%, adding about $86 to the cost of a new unit,\u00a0according\u00a0to University of Chicago researchers.",
      "Electronics like iPhones and TVs",
      "Among the nations targeted by Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are China, Taiwan and South Korea, who are top exporters of electronics to the U.S., from Apple iPhones to television sets.",
      "The Trump administration plans to hit China with a reciprocal tariff of 34%, which means that products manufactured there and imported into the U.S. could see higher prices soon after the levies go into effect on April 9.",
      "Almost all iPhones are still manufactured in China, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, although Apple has shifted some of its iPhone fabrication to India. However, the Trump administration will also be adding a 26% reciprocal tariff to Indian imports, it said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Apple produces basically all their iPhones in China and the question will be around exceptions/exemptions on this tariff policy if those companies are building more operations/factories/plants in the U.S.,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 2 research note.",
      "Automobiles",
      "In addition to Mr. Trump's previously announced 25% tariff on auto imports, which go into effect today, imported autos will also face the 10% universal tariffs. Some U.S.-made vehicles include parts imported from other countries, which will face new tariffs and increase the purchase price of those cars, experts said.",
      "Ultimately, American consumers could end up paying an additional $2,500 to $5,000 for the lowest-cost American cars, and up to $20,000 for some imported models, according to an April 2 estimate from Anderson Economic Group.",
      "Clothing and shoes",
      "The bulk of apparel and shoes sold in U.S. stores like Walmart and Target is manufactured outside the U.S., with China, Vietnam and Bangladesh among the biggest exporters.",
      "All three nations will face reciprocal tariffs from the Trump administration, at 34% for China, 46% for Vietnam and 37% for Bangladesh.",
      "Wine and spirits",
      "Italian and French wines and Scottish whisky are also likely to rise in price, as European Union imports will face a reciprocal tariff of 20% while United Kingdom-made products will face a 10% import duty.",
      "\"Tariffs on imported wines will create a ripple effect across the industry \u2014 impacting importers, distributors and consumers alike,\" Louis Amoroso, CEO of Full Glass Wine Co., told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Amoroso, whose company owns direct-to-consumer wine retailers, added, \"While it's better than 200%, a 20% tariff still compounds through the supply chain and could lead to a 40% or more cost increase for consumers.\"",
      "Furniture",
      "About 30% to 40% of furniture sold in the U.S. is manufactured in other countries, according to CNBC. Top exporters of furniture to the U.S. include China and Vietnam.",
      "Coffee and chocolate",
      "The U.S. imports about 80% of its coffee beans from Latin American countries such as Brazil and Colombia, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Both nations are included in Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, with each facing rates of 10%.",
      "Chocolate is another major Latin American import, given that the U.S. climate is by and large unsuited to growing cocoa beans. Among the nations that export cocoa beans to the country are Cote d'Ivoire and Ecuador, according to the USDA. Those nations will face reciprocal tariffs of 21% and 10%, respectively.",
      "Swiss watches",
      "Swiss imports to the U.S. will face a new reciprocal tariff of 31%, which will impact watches from affordable brands such as Swatch to pricey timepieces manufactured by the likes of Rolex.",

Countries that will see tariffs higher than 10% include the European Union, China and Israel.",
      "Senior administration officials said the 10% worldwide tariffs take effect April 5 at 12:01 a.m., and the higher reciprocal tariffs go into effect on April 9 at 12:01 a.m.",
      "\"In short, chronic trade deficits are no longer merely an economic, they're a national emergency that threatens our security and our very way of life,\" the president said in a White House Rose Garden announcement. \"And for these reasons, starting tomorrow, the United States will implement reciprocal tariffs on other nations.\"",
      "\"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating, and because we are being very kind, we're a kind people, very kind,\" Mr. Trump said. \"You're not so kind when you're ripped off\u2026 We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us.\"",
      "As he spoke, the president proudly held up a chart showing the new tariff rates the U.S. will begin to impose on allies, foes and everyone in between,",
      "Countries that will see \"discounted reciprocal rates,\" according to a sheet handed out by the White House, include China at a rate of 34%, on top of the tariffs the U.S. already imposes on China; 20% on goods from the European Union; 32% on Taiwan; 25% on South Korea and 17% on Israel.",
      "Canada and Mexico are not subject to these tariffs for now, senior administration officials said, but tariffs the president has already imposed, citing fentanyl and migration issues, persist.",

      "\"It's our declaration of economic independence,\" the president said in the White House Rose Garden. Mr. Trump labeled Wednesday \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The president lamented that the U.S. imports phones and other electronics, as well as pharmaceuticals, saying that if there's a war, the U.S. would struggle. He said his moves Wednesday are also standing up for U.S. farmers and ranchers who have been \"brutalized\" by other countries, specifically blasting Canada.",
      "Mr. Trump said the Americans \"subsidize\" a lot of other countries, calling out the European Union, China, South Korea and Australia for their trade practices.",
      "\"They've taken so much of our wealth away from us,\" Mr. Trump said of other countries.",
      "The president said he expects complaints from \"globalists,\" \"outsourcers,\" \"special interests,\" and \"fake news\" in the days ahead, but insisted those groups have been wrong about trade before.",
      "\"In the first term, they said tariffs would crash the economy,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Instead, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world.\"",
      "In the audience for the president's announcement were rank-and-file steelworkers and auto workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson, as well as most of Mr. Trump's Cabinet, including Vice President JD Vance.",
      "What new tariffs did Trump announce today?",
      "The president says his plan will place a minimum baseline of 10% tariffs on all countries, with reciprocal tariffs on many trading partners that have their own tariffs placed on the U.S. The 25% tariffs the president previously announced on foreign cars and foreign auto parts are set to go into effect at midnight.",
      "A White House official said the reciprocal tariffs are additive, meaning they will be imposed in addition to any previous tariffs already in place, unless a specific good is exempt under Section 232 of the Tariffs Act, which carries a flat 25% rate on certain things like steel and aluminum.",

The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it.\"",
      "What are tariffs, exactly?",
      "Tariffs are duties paid on goods imported into the U.S.\u00a0The most common type of tariffs are ad valorem tariffs (Latin for \"according to the value\"), which represent a fixed percentage tax on the value of a product. The 25% auto tariffs are these types of tariffs.",
      "There are also \"specific\" tariffs, which are levied as a fixed charge per unit, and \"tariff-rate quotas,\" which are taxes triggered by reaching a specific import threshold.",
      "What do financial experts say about tariffs?",
      "Economists and taxpayer advocacy groups have their doubts, and are warning tariffs could upset economic growth and will almost surely contribute to higher prices for American consumers. Some automakers have already announced higher car prices, after the president announced tariffs on foreign cars and parts.",
      "More than a dozen leaders at think tanks and taxpayer advocacy groups, including at the National Taxpayers Union, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday sent a joint letter to congressional leaders and the commerce and treasury secretaries, urging them to consider how tariffs on steel, lumber, energy, pharmaceutical and medical supplies and cars and car parts will increase prices.",
      "\"We encourage you to consider whether tariffs may, in many cases, undermine President Trump's broader long-term economic goals by increasing the cost of goods subject to tariffs,\" they wrote. \"We are especially concerned about tariffs on inputs needed by U.S. manufacturers that make it harder to compete with finished goods made abroad and tariffs that increase the price of necessities like food and housing.\"",
      "Alex Jacquez, who worked on the Biden White House National Economic Council, said that although it's hard to know the exact impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs without knowing all the details, CEOs are telling investors and shareholders they will be hiking prices.",
      "\"What the major retailers and companies who may be affected by tariffs are planning to do and they're planning out in public here is pass these costs along to consumers as much as they possibly can,\" Jacquez, now the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "Colin Grabow, associate director at the libertarian Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies, wrote in a USA Today op-ed that \"tariffs are a costly and inefficient tax usually borne by the importing country's customers.\"",
      "\"Americans may have voted for lower prices in November, but under the guise of tariff reciprocity, the Trump administration is set to deliver something very different,\" Grabow wrote.",
      "A reporter on Tuesday asked Leavitt if the president is thinking about seniors on fixed income who are stressed about the recent swings in the stock market, swings partly attributed to the president's tariff announcements. Stocks have struggled as Wall Street braces for the next round of tariffs.",
      "\"Well certainly, they are legitimate concerns and the president takes those concerns very seriously,\" Leavitt said. \"And he's addressing them every single day. And tomorrow's announcement is to protect future generations of the senior citizens you mentioned. It's for their kids and their grandkids, to ensure that there are jobs here in the United States of America for their children to live the American dream, just like they presumably did.\"",

      "A 10% universal import duty on all goods brought into the U.S.",
      "So-called reciprocal tariffs that will be applied to imports from 90 nations.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the tariffs in the White House's Rose Garden on Wednesday afternoon, said his plans reflect \"one of the most important days in American history; it's our declaration of economic independence.\" Even so, economists say the tariffs will boost prices on many products purchased by American consumers, at a time when inflation still remains elevated.",
      "An overview of Mr. Trump's new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs",
      "The first tariff will be a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S.",
      "The second tariff, reciprocal tariffs, will be applied to imports from 60 countries and are aimed at equalizing the trade imbalances between the U.S. and those nations. Mr. Trump said that reciprocal tariffs \"means they do it to us, and we do it to them.\"",
      "He added, \"It can't get any simpler than that.\"",
      "One example provided by Mr. Trump is that the U.S. charges a 2.5% tariff on automobile imports, while adding that the European Union charges a 10% tariff on American car exports to EU nations.",
      "\"Such horrendous imbalances have devastated our industrial base,\" he added.",
      "What is a reciprocal tariff?",
      "At the moment, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges on German vehicle imports.",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would apply the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries place on American exports on a product-by-product basis. By charging countries only 50% of what they charge U.S. products, Mr. Trump said he is imposing \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will also include calculations to cover non-monetary trade barriers, such as when nations devalue their currencies to help boost demand for their products from other nations.",
      "When do the tariffs go into effect?",
      "The baseline 10% tariff will go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5, while the reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Why is Trump imposing these new tariffs?",
      "During his announcement, Mr. Trump said the goal was to revitalize the industrial and manufacturing base of the U.S., promising that doing so will \"make America wealthy again.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariffs will help convince foreign businesses to relocate their factories to the U.S. The president also promised that the tariffs would lead to lower prices for Americans, although most economists are projecting that Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to boost inflation and lead to higher costs for the typical U.S. household.",
      "For instance, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 an inflation measure closely tracked by the Federal Reserve \u2014 could rise 0.5 percentage points to 3.5% by year end, according to a March 30 Goldman Sachs report.

    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 17:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs today on a number of other countries. Here's what to know about these import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced on Wednesday \u2014 a planned import tax blitz he has referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his Wednesday news conference, touting such levies as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But some economists say that tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners could be hard to structure, while also roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses. Here's what to know about reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That would be administratively complex given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" Jacquez said.",
      "Other experts suggest the goal is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S. or generating federal revenue than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals that the Trump administration is comfortable with.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-based tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to the their trade imbalance with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his administration will impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. The White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers.",
      "For example, the U.S. will match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "\"They will probably come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods,\" said Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration.",
      "That approach could result in the U.S. taxing other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\"\u00a0 a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, thinks likely targets include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 was with the following nations, according to federal data:",
      "China ($295.4 billion)European Union ($235.6 billion)Mexico ($171.8 billion)Vietnam ($123.5 billion)Ireland ($86.7 billion)Germany ($84.8 billion)Taiwan ($73.9 billion)Japan ($68.5 billion)South Korea ($66 billion)Canada ($63.3 billion)India ($45.7 billion)Thailand ($45.6 billion)Italy ($44 billion)Switzerland ($38.5 billion)Malaysia ($24.8 billion)Indonesia ($17.9 billion)France ($16.4 billion)Austria ($13.1 billion)Sweden ($9.8 billion)",

      "Are reciprocal prices likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "For now, it remains unclear what reciprocal tariff rates the U.S. might charge, although UBS analysts note that the levies imposed during Mr. Trump's first term were smaller and mostly targeted China.",
      "More certain is that reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, experts say, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "How much prices could rise remains unclear. Meanwhile, prices could fall if Mr. Trump later lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations.",
      "But when there is no good substitute for a particular good, consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply.",
      "\"The more price insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Apr 2025 20:19:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, was deported to El Salvador on March 15 despite a protective order.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court's order that required the Trump administration to return a\u00a0Maryland man\u00a0who was\u00a0mistakenly arrested\u00a0and removed to El Salvador back to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday.",
      "Roberts' administrative stay gives the Supreme Court more time to consider the matter and will remain in place \"pending further order of the undersigned or of the court,\" it states. He issued his order hours after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the\u00a0legal battle over the removal of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia last month.",
      "The Justice Department's request for emergency relief from the high court came as it faced a court-ordered 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. He was deported to a Salvadoran supermax prison on March 15 despite a 2019 protective order that should have prevented him from being sent to the country.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block that district court order, claiming that it \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it cannot compel El Salvador to \"follow a federal judge's bidding.\"",
      "\"The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the Justice Department welcomed the chief justice's stay \"as we continue to fight this case and protect the executive branch from judicial overreach.\"",
      "The dispute over Abrego Garcia's removal sparked widespread attention and outrage after the Trump administration admitted in a court filing last week that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\" The 29-year-old father was removed from the U.S. on a series of deportation flights transporting hundreds of people to the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a separate high-profile court battle involving President Trump's attempts to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a separate request from the Justice Department to allow it to resume deportations using the seldom-invoked authority.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old, according to court records. In 2019, he was arrested alongside three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities while an immigration judge examined his case.",
      "During a bond hearing before the immigration judge, the Department of Homeland Security put forth evidence claiming that a \"proven and reliable source\" confirmed Abrego Garcia had ties to the MS-13 gang. The judge denied his request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have argued in court filings that the only evidence of his alleged gang ties came from a confidential informant who claimed he was an active member of MS-13 and the fact that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and sweatshirt when he was arrested. They also said Abrego Garcia has no criminal history. \"He has never been charged or convicted of any criminal charges, in the United States, El Salvador, or any other country,\" his lawyers wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from federal custody after another immigration judge granted him a \"withholding of removal\" to El Salvador, a legal status that bars officials from removing individuals who prove they are more likely than not to be subject to persecution in their home country. In the order, the judge found that if Abrego Garcia returned to El Salvador, he would likely face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife told CBS News that her husband attended regular check-ins with immigration authorities after he was released and was working as a sheet metal worker. But he was arrested again on March 12 because of what the Trump administration said was his \"prominent role\" in MS-13 and questioned about his ties to the group, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated as a \"foreign terrorist organization\" in February.",
      "Abrego Garcia was then transferred to a detention facility in Texas, his wife said, and then placed on the flight to El Salvador on March 15.",
      "While the Trump administration acknowledged that it erred in removing Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it opposed efforts to bring him back to the U.S. because of his alleged affiliation with MS-13. The Justice Department has also argued that the government does not have jurisdiction over Abrego Garcia anymore because he is in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "A federal judge in Maryland held a hearing on the challenge to Abrego Garcia's removal, and ultimately ordered the administration to return him to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday. During the proceedings, a Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, conceded that Abrego Garcia \"should not have been removed,\" and said he was \"frustrated\" by a lack of information from the Trump administration as to why Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities. Reuveni was placed on administration leave in the wake of the hearing.",
      "The judge, Paula Xinis, issued a scathing opinion Sunday that said the federal government \"confessed grievous error\" that \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and asked it to swiftly put Xinis' order requiring Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S. on hold.",
      "Sauer then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court. His request for the high court to block Xinis' decision came just before the 4th Circuit rejected the administration's request to step into the dispute.",
      "The solicitor general, who was confirmed to the role last week, called the district court's decision \"unprecedented and indefensible,\" and claimed the the lower courts are trying to \"seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson reached a deal with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna amid her push to allow new parents to vote remotely, which paralyzed the House last week and threatened to delay a key vote on President Trump's agenda in the coming days.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, announced Sunday she and Johnson had a deal to use vote pairing \u2014 an agreement between an absent member and a member who is physically present and plans to vote on the opposite side of the question, effectively canceling out the vote. The present member casts their vote, then withdraws it and announces that they have paired with the absent member. The vote is not included in the vote total, but their positions are published in the Congressional Record.",
      "\"It will be open for the entire conference to use when unable to vote (e.g., new parents, bereaved, emergencies, etc.),\" Luna wrote Sunday.",
      "Johnson said Monday the solution is \"no harm, no foul\" and \"solved her concerns, so that's a great thing.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suffered an embarrassing loss to kill the effort to allow new parents to vote remotely around the birth of their child. Johnson, who considers proxy voting to be unconstitutional, said any further floor action was halted and sent members home.",
      "A deal could allow House leaders to move ahead on other legislative priorities this week, including holding a vote on a Republican budget blueprint that passed the Senate over the weekend.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in Thursday on the debate, telling reporters that he supported Luna's effort to allow new parents to vote remotely. But a day later, Johnson wrote on social media that Mr. Trump told him, \"Mike, you have my proxy on proxy voting.\"",
      "The measure to allow new parents to vote remotely was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January. The bill would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.",
      "Luna, a cosponsor of the bill, moved to bypass leadership and launched a\u00a0discharge petition, a procedural move that allows a measure to move forward without the speaker's approval, to force a vote on it. The discharge petition quickly reached the threshold needed to force a vote, with 206 Democrats and 11 other Republicans signing on.",
      "But Republicans tried to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security to table her discharge petition. Nine Republicans joined all Democrats during a procedural vote Tuesday to help sink it.",
      "Pettersen said in a statement Monday that the agreement between Luna and Johnson \"does not address the barriers we've fought so hard to overcome.\"",
      "\"Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don't have a voice,\" she said of Johnson. \"Let's be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Apr 2025 19:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation on March 14 invoking the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants who are allegedly members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.",
      "The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was among those on the deportation flights at issue in the case involving the Alien Enemies Act, but he was removed under a different immigration law. Chief Justice John Roberts earlier Monday temporarily paused the district court's order that set an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.",

    "summary": "As markets tumble and fears grow over a global trade war in response to President Trump's tariffs, he has advised Americans to \"be strong\" and \"hang tough.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has vehemently defended the sweeping tariffs unveiled by his administration on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, even as they threaten to spark a global trade war and have sent\u00a0stock markets tumbling around the world.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "In addition to the baseline tax, Mr. Trump had said China would face a \"reciprocal\" levy of 34%, and in response to Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, the president has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China if it does not lift those duties by Tuesday.",
      "As markets fall, and with his\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "No pause in tariffs",
      "During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "The president also said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",

      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",

      "\"Funding cuts will surely reduce or even stop the progress we are now starting to make toward cures for Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. That is especially problematic because our population is aging more than ever before and these diseases will therefore become much more prevalent in the years to come,\" he said.",
      "Cuts could threaten \"the entire pipeline\"",
      "Lawrence Chernin, CEO and co-founder of Dabble Health, a company focused on cognitive health monitoring, worries funding cuts could leave potentially life-changing innovations behind. He and his team are developing an app that he hopes could give people a \"cognitive score,\" similar to health apps that give sleep scores \u2014 but further testing is needed for scientific validatation.",
      "Despite promising data from a pilot study, Chernin said traditional investors often consider tools like theirs \"too early and too risky.\"",
      "\"Government funding through NIH and SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grants represents the only viable bridge from promising research to clinical validation,\" he told CBS News, adding that his company recently applied for an SBIR grant.",
      "\"Frankly, without this funding, our company may not survive,\" he said. \"These NIH cuts don't just threaten our company; they threaten the entire pipeline of early-stage medical innovations that could transform Alzheimer's care.\"",
      "SBIR helps fund the NIH's National Institute of Aging, which makes nearly $150 million in grants to small businesses each year. According to the institute, it is the largest source of early-stage funding for aging-related research and development, including interventions for Alzheimer's disease.",
      "And while Chernin recognizes some people think there's a lot of waste in government spending, he says \"overall it achieves so much,\" pointing to breakthroughs in cancer research, for example.",
      "\"Now, cancer isn't as terrible, actually, in terms of the scope of diseases like Alzheimer's is, because there are remedies for cancer,\" he said.",
      "Hoping for continued support",
      "Some, however, like Dr. Joshua Hare, who is chairman and chief science officer at biotechnology company Longeveron, are optimistic. The company just successfully completed a Phase 2 study, published last month in Nature Medicine, for an Alzheimer's medication they've been developing.",
      "\"Clearly, we have a president who is changing things big-time in all domains of our lives. ... They want to cut funding and streamline the NIH, that's clear, but I'm not at all convinced that they are anti-health,\" he told CBS News. Hare said he thinks there will be more funding for areas consistent with the Make America Healthy Again initiative, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s platform focusing on chronic disease, food additives and other priorities.",
      "So while there will be cuts to certain areas \u2014 COVID and DEI-related initiatives are already being hit, for example \u2014 Hare said he's not so worried about Alzheimer's research being slashed.",
      "\"I can't say that for sure. I'm not in the government. I just listened to the testimony that the new director of NIH gave to Congress in his confirmation hearings, and he specifically addressed Alzheimer's research, and he specifically said that there are avenues of research for Alzheimer's that are underfunded and deserve ongoing funding.\"",
      "His company has previously received NIH funding for a non-Alzheimer's, pediatrics-related trial, while the Alzheimer's Association entirely funded the Phase 1 trial for Longeveron's Alzheimer's drug, Hare said. \"If we didn't have that extraordinary funding from Alzheimer's Association and NIH, the company wouldn't have had been able to progress to where we are now.\" He said company remains \"full steam ahead\" on getting its product to those who \"need it as quickly as possible.\"",
      "While the long-term impacts of the cuts remain unclear, Charles J. Fuschillo, Jr, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, said in a statement to CBS News that bipartisan cooperation is essential in the continued fight against Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"We are grateful that federal policymakers in Congress and the White House worked together in a bipartisan manner over the last decade to deliver essential federal funding increases for Alzheimer's research, and appropriately treated Alzheimer's disease as a growing public health crisis, not a political issue,\" the statement read. \"Building on that progress is vital to ensure we reach the finish line of finding a cure for Alzheimer's.\"",

      "There is little to no evidence to support a \"vague, uncorroborated\" allegation that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote. And in any case, she said, an immigration judge had expressly barred the U.S. in 2019 from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he faced likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "\"As defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador \u2014 let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,\" Xinis wrote.",
      "She said it was \"eye-popping\" that the government had argued that it could not be forced to bring Abrego Garcia back because he is no longer in U.S. custody.",
      "\"They do indeed cling to the stunning proposition that they can forcibly remove any person \u2014 migrant and U.S. citizen alike \u2014to prisons outside the United States, and then baldly assert they have no way to effectuate return because they are no longer the 'custodian,' and the Court thus lacks jurisdiction,\" Xinis wrote. \"As a practical matter, the facts say otherwise.\"",
      "The Justice Department has asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to pause Xinis' ruling.",
      "Abrego Garcia gets detained",
      "Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.",

      "In her order Sunday, Xinis referenced earlier comments from now-suspended Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni in which Reuveni said: \"We concede he should not have been removed to El Salvador\" and that he responded \"I don't know\" when asked why Abrego Garcia was being held.",
      "The Justice Department placed Reuveni on leave after he made the comments.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, in an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" likened Reuveni's comments to \"a defense attorney walking in, conceding something in a criminal matter.\"",
      "\"That would never happen in this country,\" she said. \"So he's on administrative leave now, and we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Stacey Young, a former Justice Department lawyer and founder of Justice Connection, a network of department alumni that works to support employees, released a statement that defended Reuveni and said he has \"zealously represented the United States in some of the most high-stakes and controversial immigration cases under the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations.\"",
      "\"Justice Department attorneys are being put in an impossible position: Obey the president, or uphold their ethical duty to the court and the Constitution,\" Young said. \"We should all be grateful to DOJ lawyers who choose principle over politics and the rule of law over partisan loyalty.\""

      "A landmark Justice Department office created in the 1960's during the civil rights movement is marked for closure by the Trump administration, raising fears of a loss of generations of work tamping down and working to prevent unrest in the nation's major cities.",
      "An internal Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News said Trump appointees are considering closing the Community Relations Service, which was created as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The mission of the office is to be \"America's peacemaker,\" tasked with \"preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service does not investigate or prosecute crimes and has no law enforcement authority, and according to the Justice Department, its services are both confidential and free of charge to communities that accept or request them. In 2021, the agency said of its mission that it sought to help realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"inspiring dream of a vibrant, all-embracing nation unified in justice, peace, and reconciliation.\"",
      "The office has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. It was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged following the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio in 2022 after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "Former leaders of the Community Relations Service worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide.",
      "\"We would find and stop brush fires, before they became forest fires,\" said Ron Wakabayashi, a former regional director of the Community Relations Service. Wakabayashi told CBS News he fears the nation will be at greater risk of unrest, boycotts and lawsuits without the agency's Community Relations Service deployed regionally across nation.",
      "The Community Relations Service's low-profile approach means it has remained less well known even among federal government leaders, though it has been a vital asset for the Justice Department, according to some who have led the office. Community Relations Service employees have quietly intervened with church leaders, community leaders, relatives of victims of violence and city administrators to ward off unrest, lawsuits or boycotts.",
      "President John F. Kennedy conceived of the office in the early 1960s, saying the federal government should have experts who can \"identify tensions before they reach the crisis stage\" and \"work quietly to ease tensions and improve relations in any community threatened or torn with strife.\"",
      "The passage of hate crimes legislation in the wake of the killings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. in the late 1990s meant that the office's jurisdiction \"expanded to gender, sex, religion, protected classes of people,\" Wakabayashi said.",
      "He said the experienced employees of the Community Relations Service would develop relationships over the course of years in major cities, with leaders of houses of worship, police departments and activists to earn credibility and better equip themselves to mediate disputes.",
      "According to Wakabayasi, at one point the office employed 600 professional staff, including mediators and community outreach experts, in regional offices in Philadelphia, Dallas, Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Boston.",
      "The Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News indicates some of the current Community Relations Service staff would be reassigned to federal prosecutors' offices nationwide. Former staffers say that type of reorganization could cripple the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife in U.S. cities because community activists might be less willing to work with so-called peacemakers who may be perceived to be aligned with prosecutors' offices.",
      "Bert Brandenburg, who previously worked in the Community Relations Service, and other former Justice Department officials questioned plans to close the office: \"During eras of soaring racial tension \u2013 wouldn't it make sense to have people in communities while they arise ... so they don't lead to boycotts, litigation or unrest?\"",
      "\"Violence prevention works best when communities see conciliators as honest brokers they can open up with as part of working through conflicts, which is distinct from the critical work of prosecutors holding wrongdoers accountable,\" Brandenburg told CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a speech in July 2024, Justin Lock, a former director of the Community Relations Service, lauded the office's accomplishments. Lock said the office had been \"at the intersection of some of the most critical moments in our nation's journey toward justice.\"",
      "\"In 2020, when Americans marched in solidarity with the people of Brunswick, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, CRS engaged with communities as an impartial, confidential facilitator, helping stakeholders identify and implement solutions that help communities to heal and move forward,\" Locke said.",
      "Rep Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, in a statement to CBS News praised the office's work in defusing tensions between minority communities and the government and expressed concern about reports that it would be cut. \"At a time when hate crimes and community tensions are on the rise, reducing support for this essential office would be a grave mistake,\" he said. \"I urge the DOJ to reaffirm its commitment to building trust and bringing greater safety to all our communities.\"",

      "\"The Government's contentions that the district court's order improperly encroached on the Executive's prerogative to manage foreign affairs are unavailing,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote. \"Courts routinely exercise jurisdiction to protect individual rights, including in immigration cases, without impinging on the Executive's ability to conduct foreign affairs. ... Courts routinely order the Government to return, or facilitate the return, of individuals the Government wrongly removed to foreign countries\u2014including El Salvador.\"",

      "\"Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States,\" Xinis continued.",
      "During Friday's hearing, Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni conceded to Xinis that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed from the U.S. or sent to El Salvador. Reuveni could not tell the judge upon what authority he was arrested in Maryland.",

      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Thanks. Great to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about what the Secretary just laid out. He did not describe this as leverage to get to a deal. He said this, take them literally. The tariffs are here to stay. We've already seen some conservative groups, like the New Civil Liberties Alliance, file suit saying that these are not on solid constitutional and legal ground. Do you think the president's on solid legal ground?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I think he is. But this is about a monumental change in the direction of our government. We are, and I'm talking about change in terms of the size as well as the priorities, and this is 180 degree change from what we had for the last four years with big government, big spending, big taxes, and we have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people. That's why we passed what we did just yesterday in the Senate, because we want people to have more- better jobs, more opportunities and more money in their own pockets. So in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool, and I think we have to go after China. They have been abusing us for years, and I believe the president is on firm constitutional grounds.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what- when I hear you talk about sort of the one, two punch on the economic plan for the president, tax cuts being one of them. Isn't there some coordination on sequencing here? Because wouldn't you go ahead and remove the regulations and go ahead with the tax cuts before you go to war with the entire world over trade?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the president has been talking about these tariffs every speech that I was with him during the during the campaign. There is no surprise here, he's also talked about making sure we don't have this $4 trillion tax increase that the Democrats want to have. We have a lot of work to do to reverse the damage that's been done over the last four years with with the Democrats that led to the highest inflation in 40 years. So the president wants to get a lot of things done, and I want to get a lot of things done in Congress as part of this comprehensive economic plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you saw the Fed chair also say that we may be facing inflation now in part because of these tariffs. You know, some in the Senate are very concerned about having more control and say over trade. Maria Cantwell, a senator who will be with us later in this program partnered with Chuck Grassley, one of the most powerful Republicans, with this bill to try to claw back control. They want 48 hours notice on tariffs. Suggests they didn't get much this time, and they want them to expire after 60 days, unless Congress approves of them. Will leadership let this effort advance?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Senator Grassley is Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but let me just say the president is on firm legal grounds here. Over the last 90 years, Congress has given the president's different presidents more and more authority to deal with national security issues, with regard to tariffs, to use tariffs with regard to unfair trade. So the president has the authority. I think this is similar to the bill that Chuck Grassley introduced about five years ago. They had debate then, many of the co-sponsors are the same. This will get a thorough hearing, and then we'll see where it goes from there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that Congress needs to have more of a say on trade issues?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the Constitution says Congress has the entire say, but over the last 90 years--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the way it's playing out now\u2013",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: --more and more authority have been given to the president to be able to be more nimble to react in terms of national security, in terms of unfair trade. And I think President Trump is doing what he has every right to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you're open to making that more clear on what the limits should be.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there'll be a discussion in the Senate. We'll see which way the discussion goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the work that got done over the weekend. You did take this step forward in advancing the president's tax agenda and raising the debt ceiling with this budget framework, you know what a fight you're going to have with fellow Republicans over it in the house. Jodey Arrington, the budget chairman, called it unserious and disappointing. Accused your Republican colleagues of creating 6 trillion in new costs and a mere 4 billion in enforceable cuts. Is this headed for failure in the house?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: No, we are united in what we believe in terms of making sure we have a nation that is safe and prosperous. The Speaker of the House and the leadership of the House came out and endorsed what we have done, and said, hey, we ought to move ahead and take that next step--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Five Republicans have come out against it--",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: -- so what we have seen--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's a pretty narrow margin.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: \u00a0But- but they all agree with what we want to do, which is unleash American energy to get energy prices down for people. They all agree that we ought to make sure that we don't have these $4 trillion tax increases. They all want to make sure we secure the border. So all of the parts of what we have here are part of what we want to have done. Now I'm the whip. My job is to count votes. We need 51 in the Senate. They need 218 in the house. We have to iron out the differences. We're committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know they're short about five votes right now. So it sounds like if you have to take another bite at the apple, the reason that this matters so much is procedurally, you've got to clear the way for all those big things you want to get, done, like the tax cuts by September. Speaker Johnson said he wants it done by May. Senator Lankford said it has to get done by August. Does all the instability speed things up for you?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I'm not worried about deadlines. I want to get- I have an urgency to get it done as soon as we can, so we can get these policies in place and also to provide the certainty to people who are worried, are my taxes going to go up at the end of the year? They want to have the confidence that they're not going to go up. I think the more certainty we can provide to the to the folks around the country that they will see that we have- on the right path for a strong, healthy, growing economy, and we want to get the country back on track, and the sooner we can get this passed, the sooner we can reverse the damage the Democrats have done over the last four years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got to get speaker Johnson to wrangle those votes though, which you admit they're not there right now.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, we're going to put the language together. We do have to iron out the differences, and I'm committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in about 18 months, Congress will face elections, these midterm races. Here's your fellow Republican, Senator Rand Paul.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Historically, tariffs have also led to political decimation. When McKinley, most famously put tariffs on in 1890 they lost 50% of their seats in the next election, but Hawt-Smooley put on their tariff in the early 1930s we lost the House and the Senate for 60 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN \u00a06:22",
      "Are you afraid history is going to repeat itself in 2026?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, no, I'm not. There's a long way between now and the 2026 elections. President Trump won based on two things that the Democrats were the party of high prices and an open border. No one doubted president Trump's ability to get the border closed and 137,000 illegal immigrants in March of last year, Biden this past much down to 7000 so he has been able to do that. Republicans are going to be judged on the economy, which is why I'm not",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Fed's chairman is saying inflation is going to potentially go up and there's great uncertainty.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: That's why I want to get this comprehensive economic plan in place as soon as possible. The certainty that the tax increases are not going to be there, the certainty that we have American energy and those jobs, the certainty we're bringing jobs back into the country, all of those things are going to make sure that by the election, 18 months from now, that people say, yeah, we're on the right path. Republicans have gotten the country back. Country is back on track right now from I think it's even your own CBS poll in terms of right track, wrong track, right direction, wrong direction. We're at the highest we've been in 20 years, in terms of the direction the country is heading.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was pre tariffs. Senator Ted Cruz said this,",
      "TED CRUZ: Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers, so my hope is these tariffs are short lived, and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot of concern, including from your your old friend Mitch McConnell. When do you get concerned that this is going to hurt the economic story you are trying to tell?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, you won't be surprised. Ted and I were on the floor just two in the morning. I said, you know, I bet Margaret's going to show that tape of what you just said about tariffs, and we joked about it a little bit. But there is concern, and there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets. This is not a surprise. People are concerned about this. 40k- 401ks, retirement plans. They do the best when we have confidence in the future, when we have a strong, healthy, growing economy. And that's why we have a comprehensive economic plan to deal with all of this, to making sure the taxes don't go up, to cut so much of this reckless Washington spending, people saw the list of all the terrible things we've been spending money on the last four years, and people were offended and angry at that. What we're doing is also cutting a lot of this reckless Washington spending gives people more money in their own pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Markets move a lot faster than Congress does, Senator. So you've got your work cut out for you, but we appreciate you laying out the details for us.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO:Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/probationary-workers-in-limbo-legal-battles-over-their-firings-continue/",
    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 15:26:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Probationary workers fired as part of President Trump's downsizing talked about their jobs and their ongoing employment limbo as legal fights continue.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Probationary workers were among the first victims of President Trump's second-term efforts to downsize the federal government. Mass firings across the federal government targeted thousands of them, but legal challenges over their termination have left them in an uneasy employment limbo after a pair of court rulings that cover employees at 20 agencies.",
      "These are workers who are in their first year or two of federal service, depending on their position, although probationary workers can also include experienced U.S. government employees who recently started working in a new position, including through promotions, or at a different agency.",
      "Sara Nelson, 50, was just two days away from the end of her probationary period, which started after she was hired in February 2024 at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. She previously worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a different component of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Nelson, who lives in Georgia, managed multi-million-dollar nationwide campaigns to raise awareness of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Nelson said she loved the work she was doing and found it meaningful because it helped to connect Americans struggling with their mental health with a vital resource.",
      "\"Federal workers, the vast majority of us, are so dedicated to serving Americans, to serving our country,\" she said. \"We care about efficiencies in government. We're often caught up in these bureaucratic traps as well, but we're trying hard every day to bring 200%. The work of the government serves the American people.\"",
      "Nelson had received a positive performance review in January, she said, but the letter she got from the acting chief human capital officer at the Department of Health and Human Services stated that her \"performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.\"",
      "\"It was totally unsettling,\" she said of receiving the termination letter. \"It's hard to describe because you know your team loves you and wants to keep you. You know there is a huge need, and yet you're being dismissed.\"",
      "Then, on March 18, Nelson received a brief, two-paragraph email from her agency informing her that she had been reinstated to her role. The notification came on the heels of two different court orders that required the administration to bring back probationary employees it had fired at more than a dozen agencies. The Justice Department has now asked the Supreme Court to lift one of those orders, covering more than 16,000 probationary workers at six agencies.",
      "\"HHS has canceled your separation from duty and you have been restored to duty in a paid Administrative Leave status through at least the end of this week. We will update you further once we have more information,\" the message Nelson received to her personal email address read.",
      "While the note included two email addresses to direct questions, Nelson said messages she sent about back pay have gone unanswered. She also has not received any further information about her position at SAMHSA since learning of her reinstatement, Nelson said.",
      "SAMHSA was impacted by layoffs of up to 10,000 people at the Health and Human Services Department. Another 10,000 at the department took early retirement or voluntary separation officers.",
      "While Mr. Trump and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is leading the effort to shrink the size of the federal government, often speak of the need to root out waste at federal agencies, Nelson said there was never any assessment done within SAMHSA to pinpoint areas to improve efficiency.",
      "\"I can't describe the level of stress and confusion about what's happening,\" she said. \"We get the rug pulled out from under us multiple times. We're trying to find other jobs. But it's like, should I interview or might I get my old job back that I absolutely loved? But all we know at this point is we have to move forward.\"",
      "Court records have revealed that more than 24,500 federal workers who were in their probationary periods were fired in mid-February and have since been reinstated to comply with the judicial orders. Most of those employees have been put on administrative leave, agencies said, and whether they will be allowed to keep those jobs \u2014 and for how long \u2014 remains uncertain.",
      "\"They're trying to extend the authority of the executive, and the authority of [the Office of Personnel Management] in a manner that is completely inconsistent with the law and with the way the civil service system is set up to work,\" Michelle Bercovici, a lawyer at Alden Law Group who represents federal employees, said.",
      "Bercovici said federal employees can be fired and held accountable for performance, but \"you just have to follow the rules.\"",
      "Legal proceedings in the two cases involving the mass firings of government workers are ongoing, and on Tuesday, one of the judges issued a preliminary injunction that blocked terminations of probationary workers in 19 states and the District of Columbika, which sued over the removals.",
      "The injunction from U.S. District Judge James Bredar effectively extends an earlier decision ordering reinstatements at 20 agencies, but only for workers in the states that sued.",
      "Separate from the courts, some workers have found relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal employee terminations.",
      "Isabel Dziak, 30, is among U.S. Forest Service workers in Juneau, Alaska, who were laid off in February. She served as a lead ranger at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, a role that not only educates tourists but handles any medical emergencies and park safety.\u00a0 The park serves 25,000 visitors a day in peak season, according to Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, with the first cruise ships of the year set to arrive next week.",
      "Dziak said her team was gutted during government-wide probationary layoffs, and she was among the casualties because she was still in a probationary period, thanks to a promotion in 2023. She lost what she described as her dream job.",
      "\"I really showed up to my job every day, loving it and wanting to do the best and worked really hard to make a career for myself,\" Dziak said. \"Having it stolen in such an illegal way is just unfathomable.\"",
      "In late February, then-special counsel Hampton Dellinger filed a request with the Merit Systems Protection Board for a 45-day pause on the firings of roughly 6,000 probationary workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the Forest Service.",
      "The board granted the stay early last month and ordered USDA employees to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Dellinger had made his request to the MSPB while he pursued litigation challenging his own firing by Mr. Trump. A federal appeals court allowed his removal on March 5, the day the board granted his request to pause the USDA workers' firings. Dellinger has since dropped his case.",
      "In an earlier statement, he said the Office of Special Counsel \"requested this stay because the thousands of probationary terminations at USDA appear to have been carried out in a manner inconsistent with federal personnel laws.\"",
      "It's unclear who is serving as the acting special counsel. A request for comment from the Office of Special Counsel was not returned, and that information is not available on the agency's website. The acting special counsel would ask the MSPB to extend the pause on the firings of USDA workers that is set to expire on April 18.",
      "Mr. Trump also fired a member of the MSPB, leaving it with one member, acting chairman Henry Kerner. Because Kerner is the sole member of the board, it lacks a quorum and cannot issue final decisions on petitions for review until it is restored.",
      "\"The fundamentals of the civil service system are directly under fire,\" Bercovici said. \"The processes are still moving along as they should, but the administration is targeting the tips of the spear, the critical chokepoints where decisions actually happen.\"",
      "The administration believes it will prevail as the cases work their way up to the Supreme Court, arguing the firings were within the administration's authority to manage its internal affairs.",
      "A senior administration official blamed the lower courts and \"activist judges\" for keeping probationary employees in limbo and claimed many employees have moved on. The administration hopes they seek employment in the private sector, the official said.",
      "At the USDA, workers including Dziak have also received what was billed as a \"second and final\" deferred resignation offer, running through April 8.",
      "A spokesman said the Agriculture Department is giving employees an opportunity \"to take control of their next step in federal service before any changes take place.\" Roughly 75,000 federal workers accepted an earlier offer from the Trump administration to leave their government positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "After weighing whether to take the new offer and wondering if she was even eligible, Dziak decided to accept it, though it's pending approval from the agency. In the meantime, she says she's received two paychecks, as part of the backpay ordered by the MSPB.",
      "She said she was also asked about her interest in returning to work but is worried she could be fired in a future reduction-in-force.",
      "A major factor for Dziak is having health insurance coverage and whether she would be able to keep her plan until September through the deferred resignation program, she said. If not, Dziak said she may have to go back on Medicaid.",
      "\"That's kind of the sticky situation that I find myself in, plus the moral of do I want to take this essentially buyout,\" she said. \"Morally, I don't want to be bought out from my job that I've been battling to keep and ultimately decided to walk away from because the work environment is just terrible.\"",
      "Dziak called the confusion surrounding what happens next for federal workers like her \"disheartening.\"",
      "Alex, a National Park Service employee who works at a site in New York City, started his job in May 2024 and was working on programs for America's 250th Birthday celebration next year.",
      "Alex, who asked to be identified by his first name because he is still waiting to receive full back pay, said he was looking forward to educating park site visitors on the nation's history. Expecting to receive a termination email on Valentine's Day, when thousands of other probationary workers did, Alex said he left for the day after receiving no word from his agency.",
      "But when he returned on Monday, Alex said he had an after-hours email from Feb. 14 saying he had been fired for performance reasons, even though his most recent performance review rated him as \"fully successful.\"",
      "\"My biggest concern was with my career,\" he said. \"The main reason I took this job was to advance my career in the federal government.\"",
      "Alex said he had been working toward a specific hiring designation for certain employees of a land management agency, which allows them to compete for permanent positions in the competitive service, and qualified for it after he was fired and then reinstated.",
      "Like the other federal workers who were abruptly fired and then rehired, Alex said he received an email informing him that his termination had been canceled and cited his work on America's 250th Birthday as the reason. But he hasn't received any further guidance about benefits, and when he returned to his office, he didn't have a computer or an access card for more than a week.",
      "Alex said he still has several months on his lease in New York City but is applying now for other jobs, including as a state park ranger and at other federal agencies.",
      "\"Everyone is scared, and it puts a damper on working here,\" he said. \"It had been exciting, being in the big city working on these programs for the public, for the anniversary. Now, I just want to leave.\"",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump vows to reshape global trade, and that sends stock markets reeling. Is it just short-term pain or a long-term problem?",
      "President Trump delivered on his campaign promises, putting 25 percent duties on foreign autos and 10 percent on imports from all countries, but his decision to launch a surprise round of wide-ranging tariffs on allies and adversaries alike, shocked investors and sparked recession fears.",
      "(Begin VT)",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president claims all is going according to plan and hit the links this weekend, though he was tracking headlines about China's decision to fire back with tariffs on all American products.",
      "We will get the latest from President Trump's point man on tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and check in with the number two Senate Republican, John Barrasso. He's tasked with carrying out the other part of the president's economic agenda, sweeping tax cuts.",
      "House Republican Don Bacon and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell will also join us. They want Congress to reclaim its authority over trade policy.",
      "Then, as the administration continues talks with Russia for a possible peace deal in Ukraine, we will ask NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte what the budding relationship could mean for the future of the Western alliance.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It is shaping up to be another turbulent week, as President Trump's trade war with the world escalates. The global sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements wiped out more than $6 trillion of wealth from the U.S. stock market in just two days.",
      "In a social media post yesterday, the president urged the country to hang tough, all this as tens of thousands of people took to the streets yesterday from Washington, D.C., to Minnesota and Columbus, Ohio, protesting many of Trump's policies, Elon Musk and tariffs.",
      "We begin this morning with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "Mr. Secretary, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see about 60 percent of Americans have money in the stock market, which mean that retirees could be just as concerned as hedge fund managers this morning.",
      "Did you expect this level of shock in the financial markets?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, you have got to realize this is a national security issue. I mean, we don't make medicine in this country anymore. We don't make ships. We don't have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right?",
      "All our semiconductors are made overseas, so every button we press when we try to start our car or even use our microwave, these are all semiconductors. They're all made elsewhere. We have got to start to protect ourselves, and we have got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and the rest of the world has a surplus with us. They're earning our money. They're taking our money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump has seen this, and he's going to stop it.",
      "So it is going to be a big change. Of course, it's going to be a big change, but the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years. Donald Trump has seen it. He's spoken about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. And\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's just not going to take it anymore, and that's his model.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that was abundantly clear during the presidential campaign how much the president truly believes in tariffs and putting it at the center of his economic policy.",
      "But you saw absolute panic in the global markets. Did you expect that, or were you surprised?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike.",
      "The idea that all the countries of the world can run trade surpluses with America and buy our things with us, remember, $1.2 trillion \u2013 in 1980, we were a net investor, meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's a different world. This is a different market.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And now \u2013 and now they own $18 trillion of us net. So that means the rest of the world \u2013 every year, when we run a $1.2 trillion deficit, the rest of the world buys $1.2 trillion of America.",
      "And it goes up and up and up, and eventually we're not going to own America, and we are going to be owned by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Imagine if we had a war and we can't build a ship\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 we can't fly a plane, we can't build our own planes, we don't have our own semiconductors. This is what the president is here to fix for America. It's in his hands and he wants to fix America. This is his chance to fix America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we need him to fix it for our children and our grandchildren.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but for businesses to do what you're doing, because what I hear you laying out there is a plan to reindustrialize the United States and to bring companies back to America.",
      "For a CEO to choose to invest\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well said. Well said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But for a CEO to make those decisions, you know this, they need certainty. They need to know if it costs them more to stay overseas or if it costs them more to move here.",
      "So can you give them clarity, so that they don't just cut jobs because they're dealing with the cost of these tariffs? Can you tell them how long they're staying in place?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Absolutely.",
      "The United States of America is going to protect the people who invest in America. Trillions and trillions of dollars, you heard the president speak about it, are coming to invest in America. This is the economy of the world.",
      "We are the consumer of the world, and companies need to build it here and we will protect them for building it here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So does\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We will help the American workers. Yes, American workers are more expensive, but they're better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're going to protect all the factories that come to America. And that's what's coming here. So, the president is on it. He's going to protect them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, remember, this is a national security issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he needs to address our budget deficit.",
      "That \u2013 you know, the laws of America are the laws of America. He would like it to be that we need to protect the companies that invest here and we are going to protect the companies that invest here. That is the policy of the United States of America. That's why trillions of dollars are coming here.",
      "The ripoff of the United States of America is over.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All these companies are going to come and invest here. That's what they're doing. That's why they have committed trillions of dollars. They know this is the economy. This is the place to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Mr. Secretary, though \u2013 Mr. Secretary, the campaign is over. You won.",
      "So I'm asking what the plan is. So, the Treasury secretary said on another network: \"We're going to hold the course. It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.\"",
      "That makes it sound like the tariffs are staying in place at least for days or weeks. Is that correct? Or is the president considering postponing implementation to negotiate?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious.",
      "The president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. We are paying away our future and our lives. The countries of the world are ripping us off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And it's got to end. The president has made it crystal, crystal clear. This is the policy.",
      "We are going to protect \u2013 the factories that come build in America, we are going to protect them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They're going to be successful. That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the Earth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All of these companies are going to come and build here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when three of the president's other economic advisers who are on other networks today say that 50 different countries have been calling the White House to try to talk about the tariffs, what does that mean?",
      "Because that makes it sound like there is a negotiation, which is different from saying the tariffs are permanent.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, what it shows is that all these countries know that they have been ripping us off and the day has come for that to end.",
      "Now, the problem is, it's not just tariffs. Like, I will give you an example. Like, Vietnam said, they'd like to be zero-zero. Remember, Vietnam sends us $120 billion worth of goods every year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, cheap manufacturing.",

      "So it's not the tariffs. It has nothing to do with tariffs. If they went to zero-zero, they would go to $200 billion with us. We need to stop the ripoff. And zero-zero is the way to make them more of a ripoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but we don't have zero-zero, sir.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't have zero-zero, actually, because when we saw the president stand in the Rose Garden holding up that chart that you helped make, that wasn't actually tariffs.",
      "That was actually confusing to investors, because it was some kind of other formula. And the countries themselves seemed kind of random. Like, why are the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face 10 percent tariffs?",
      "Did you use A.I. to generate this?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No. No, the idea \u2013 look, the idea is that there are many countries left off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are they on the list?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Because the idea \u2013 what happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.",
      "Any country \u2013 like, we had tariffs \u2013 the president put tariffs on China, right, in 2018. And then what China started doing is, they started going through other countries to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They just built through other countries through America.",
      "And so the president knows that. He's tired of it. And he's going to fix that. So, basically, he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them.",

      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I'm \u2013 not that I have \u2013 I have not participated in any meetings with respect to that. The country is focused on \u2013 you realize, trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP. The factories being built in America are huge GDP.",

      "We have already seen some conservative groups, like the New Civil Liberties Alliance, file suit, saying that these are not on solid constitutional and legal ground. Do you think the president's on solid legal ground?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well I think he is.",
      "But, look, this is about a monumental change in the direction of our government. We are \u2013 and I'm talking about a change in terms of the size, as well as the priorities. And this is a 180-degree change from what we had for the last four years with big government, big spending, big taxes.",
      "And we have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people. That's why we passed what we did just yesterday in the Senate, because we want people to have more \u2013 better jobs, more opportunities, and more money in their own pockets.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I hear you talk about sort of the one-two punch on the economic plan for the president, tax cuts being one of them, isn't there some coordination on sequencing here?",
      "Because wouldn't you go ahead and remove the regulations and go ahead with the tax cuts before you go to war with the entire world over trade?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the president has been talking about these tariffs every speech that I was with him during the campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was indeed.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: There is no surprise here. He's also talked about making sure we don't have this $4 trillion tax increase that the Democrats want to have.",

      "You know some in the Senate are very concerned about having more control and say over trade. Maria Cantwell, a senator who will be with us later in this program, partnered with Chuck Grassley, one of the most powerful Republicans, with this bill to try to claw back control. They want 48 hours' notice on tariffs, suggest they didn't get much this time.",
      "And they want them to expire after 60 days unless Congress approves of them. Will leadership let this effort advance?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Senator Grassley is chairman of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "But let me just say, the president is on firm legal grounds here. Over the last 90 years, Congress has given the presidents, different presidents, more and more authority to deal with national security issues with regard to tariffs, to use tariffs with regard to unfair trade. So the president has the authority.",
      "I think this is similar to the bill that Chuck Grassley introduced about five years ago. They had debate then. Many of the cosponsors are the same. This will get a thorough hearing, and then we will see where it goes from there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that Congress needs to have more of a say on trade issues?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the Constitution says Congress has the entire say, but over the last 90 years\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the way it's playing out now.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: \u2026 more and more authority has been given to the president to be able to be more nimble to react in terms of national security, in terms of unfair trade.",
      "And I think President Trump is doing what he has every right to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you're open to making that more clear on what the limits should be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there will be a discussion in the Senate. We will see which way the discussion goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the work that got done over the weekend. You did take the step forward in advancing the president's tax agenda and raising the debt ceiling with this budget framework.",
      "You know what a fight you're going to have with fellow Republicans over in the House. Jodey Arrington, the Budget chairman, called it unserious and disappointing, accused your Republican colleagues of creating $6 trillion in new costs and a mere $4 billion in enforceable cuts.",

      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No.",
      "We are united in what we believe in terms of making sure we have a nation that is safe and prosperous. The speaker of the House and the leadership of the House came out and endorsed what we have done and said, hey, we ought to move ahead and take that next step.",
      "So what we have seen\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Five Republicans have come out against it. And it's a pretty narrow margin.",

      "They all want to make sure we secure the border. So all of the parts of what we have here are part of what we want to have done. Now, I'm the whip. My job is to count votes. We need 51 in the Senate. They need 218 in the House. We have to iron out the differences. We're committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know they're short about five votes right now. So it sounds like, if you have to take another bite at the apple \u2013 the reason that this matters so much is procedurally you have got to clear the way for all those big things you want to get done, like the tax cuts, by September.",
      "Speaker Johnson said he wants it done by May. Senator Lankford said it has to get done by August. Does all the instability speed things up for you?",

      "They want to have the confidence that they're not going to go up. I think the more certainty we can provide to the folks around the country, that they will see that we have \u2013 on the right path for a strong, healthy, growing economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And we want to get the country back on track. And the sooner we can get this passed, the sooner we can reverse the damage that the Democrats have done over the last four years.",

      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which you admit they're not there right now?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, you heard the - the Senate whip talk about your effort to claw back some control over trade. He said it will have a thorough hearing and we'll see where it goes from there. Do you have any indication of momentum among some of your Republican colleagues?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, the first day of interdiction we signed up seven Republicans. So, usually you don't get first introduction and get so many people on board. But I think it shows the anxiety that people have. I'm sure if they listen to their constituents, consumer challenges are already starting to surface. And certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people.",
      "So, I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them. Today consumer groups are announcing and retailers the fact that they want Congress to take this action up. And so, I think we're hearing from a big segment of the economy, the consumer spending is a big part of GDP, and they're worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got, what six Republicans at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Seven.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Seven. And now you're saying retailers. Like, you have CEOs who are onboard or industry groups?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Industry groups, like the Retailers Association, the outdoor industry, the Consumer Electronics Group, Main Street Alliance, organizations who know their bread and butter comes from consumer spending, which is a big part of our economy. And so, they are very anxious about a plan.",
      "Listen, I listened to your segment. I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life. And the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the letters in Greek - all the stuff that makes no sense. That's what people are - consumers are saying. How is this helping me, in a time of inflation? You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods.",
      "And so, I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Canada and China are among your state's largest export markets. Both of - have already announced retaliatory tariffs. I know you've said previously that the first Trump administration and the more limited tariffs still to this day have an impact on your state. So, how much wiggle room do we have with time here? Because you heard the Commerce secretary say that basically these aren't a negotiating ploy, that they are staying in place. That's what he says.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how long before damage?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're - we have seen damage from the first Trump tariffs on things like apples, and markets closed. And what you do is you end up then losing farm family economies. You don't necessarily lose farmland. Some big corporation might buy it. But you lose family farms. So, our objective should be to help farmers open up doors to these overseas markets.",
      "The United States' goal here should be to make great manufactured products and grow great agriculture products and then get those markets opened up. But what the president is doing is instead of building those alliances, he basically is getting into a trade war that is having unbelievable impact, when his last tariffs on India -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: We reopened with the apple market and we went to India and said, let's - let's get rid of this. And we were successful. And that's the kind of action we would have - we want to see today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state is one of the top five unionized states in the country. You have the world's largest plane manufacturer, Boeing, in Washington. So, I wonder if those union workers are as supportive of the tariffs as the auto industry workers have been. They are not against them, even though some are Democrats. In fact, they think some of them, including on this program, like Shawn Fain, have been very supportive.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're seeing - you could get the letter from the Machinist International. They don't support the president on this. And that is because they understand how much the United States and Canada have become an integrated supply chain. That helped us lower the cost of U.S. manufacturing for cars and for airplanes. And lowering that cost means that we're even more competitive.",
      "So, they don't like the uncertainty. And what they would like to see instead is the continuation of investment from the last administration. So, when you think of chips and science, and you think of the Inflation Reduction Act that made investments in next generation technology, the sectors that have a lot of employees want to win on innovation. They know that investment in innovation will help us outpace our competition, not a tariff that makes the product more expensive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Boeing's CEO testified, 80 percent of the airplanes they deliver are to markets outside the U.S., 80 percent of the content of those airplanes are manufactured here. They have a vested interest in clearing the decks for themselves here. What are they telling you about their conversations with the administration?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, everybody's concerned that the administration might retaliate against them. That, you know, that if they're not front and center in this - in this debate, but they're clear that they are being heard. I think people are saying that their strategy is - there's a demand for 40,000 airplanes and we could increase 1,000 more planes being sold, it would have a huge impact on the trade deficit.",
      "So, they are trying so say, Mr. President, don't cut the innovation and investment. Don't make semiconductors more expensive. Don't make the parts more expensive. Make it cheaper. And the United States bet on the American worker, and they will do the rest when it comes to the innovation that's required for America to build the best products.",
      "So, I think the president's math is wrong. I think he doesn't know the calculus is going to be so devastating to American consumers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CANTWELL: And that's why those groups are joining us today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cantwell, thank you for your time today.",
      "CANTWELL: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Nebraska Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who joins us this morning from Omaha.",
      "Congressman, I have a lot to get to with you on a number of topics here. But just to - to pick up on the tariffs that we've been speaking about. I know you are introducing companion legislation to what Senator Cantwell just laid out for us. But as I understand it, in the House, Republican leaders have already restricted the ability to rein in changes to the Mexico, Canada and China tariffs. They've tucked language into the continuing resolution.",
      "Does that get in your way when you are trying to now claw back some congressional control of tariffs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-NE): Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.",
      "And I enjoyed listening to Senator Cantwell. I - I support the legislation that Senator Grassley, Senator Cantwell, we have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate. And I have some beginning support in the House side which will unveil tomorrow. It will be harder to pass this in the House no doubt. I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate it will put pressure on the House to look at this. And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.",
      "So, it will not pass tomorrow -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Or maybe in the next couple weeks. But this will be in the queue that we can use. And it's time that Congress restores its authorities here. And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes. And we gave some of that power to executive branch. And I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I hear you saying you have some momentum. Respectfully, sir, the president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to them. Did Republicans just not take him seriously?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, there's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. It's a good question. You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republicans supported tariffs in the 1800s. And up and through, what, 1930, when we passed the Smoot-Hartley Act that created one of the worst - well, the worst depressions we ever had, we learned from that, that tariffs and protectionism does not work and that free trade, in the end, as long as it's fair, we want fair trade. And I support the president wanting to get fairness. Some of these countries do treat us wrong. But fair trade should be the goal.",
      "And you're right, the president talked about those. He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. But here's my take on it, and I've - I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. People voted for President Trump because of the border. And he has really delivered there. They voted for him, too, because inflation surpassed wage increases. They've - they were poorer today than they were four years ago. And I really think people voted for President Trump because of that, the border, and maybe crime if they - crime in the big cities.",
      "I don't think, in the end, I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision-making when it came to last November.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, I just - I know we certainly covered them on this program. And it is surprising to me, or perhaps it shouldn't be, that the business community is so silent right now. As Senator Cantwell said, she said they're afraid.",
      "But there is a conservative group, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, that filed suit to challenge these tariffs in court. Do you think it is the courts where this ultimately gets settled?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think ultimately it's in Congress once we see enough of this, but maybe the courts as well.",
      "The Constitution makes it very clear, Congress has control of taxes. And by the way - and let's be candid, tariffs are a tax. But they also mention tariffs in the Constitution. And we gave the president emergency powers. So, the courts will have to decide is what - what just happened, is this emergency powers or is this a total change in tariff policy. And I think it's really the latter. This is where Congress has to step in and say, do we really want to create this new policy on tariffs? And if it is, it should come from the Congress and not the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your work on the Armed Services Committee. President Trump has fired the top two officials at the head of the very powerful National Security Agency. It's one of the most powerful intelligence agencies we have. It vacuums up information around the world through wiretapping, signals intercepts and they work with the military, with Cyber Command.",
      "Have you received any explanation to Congress as to why General Haugh, the four-star general unanimously confirmed to the job, was suddenly dismissed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Margaret, I have not. But let me just comment on this. General Haugh is the absolute best leader in the U.S. military to lead Cyber Command and National Security Agency. He commanded both because half of Cyber Command relies on NSA to be effective in cyber operations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: So, you have to have this team. And he was in charge of both. He served 34 years in the military, and his entire career was working signals intelligence or cyber operations. Frankly, he is the best that we had. And they also fired the number two person at the National Security Agency without an explanation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I will tell you, this puts us back. It hurts us. And I will tell you, Russia and China today are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified. Guys that we spent three and a half decades preparing to have this role, and he's gone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And it's - it's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without explanation. And it hurt us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and our reporting, as a network, is that it came as a decision following an Oval Office meeting with a right-wing activist named Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about 9/11, said anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant things, racist things.",
      "It also happened as at least six other National Security Council officials at the White House were dismissed on the advice of Laura Loomer.",
      "I'm wondering, again respectfully, sir, Republicans are in control and you have oversight. Are there going to be hearings on this? Are there other Republicans who are concerned and going to do something about it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I'm sure there will be some oversight. I'm a - I'm the chairman of the Cyber Subcommittee, and so I guarantee you that we will have various military leaders, we'll have the secretary of defense speak to us, and he will be asked about this. And I will -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he even know?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I don't know that he knew, but we'll find out when we ask him. We'll ask him. He'll say that this is the president's right. And the president does have constitutional right to do this. But it doesn't make it appropriate or - OK, he may have the constitutional authority to do it, but it doesn't make it right.",
      "And, in the end, I'm going to make it clear, we just removed the most qualified military leader that we had to run Cyber Command and NSA. And we will ask about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Now, we have oversight. That doesn't mean we can - the president does have the constitutional authority to do this. But we have a - we have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And I have a responsibility to make clear this was wrong. It hurt us. It hurt our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, do you think it is so that the president can split up those two commands and put someone of his own choosing, a political ally, at the top of the NSA?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: You know, it's possible. I know that's out there. But I would say that's a mistake. NSA is very important to Cyber Command. You can't do Cyber Command without the inputs from the National Security Agency, the SECNET (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: If you separate them and put them under two different commands, then you're going to create a dysfunctional partnership and it will hurt our cyber operations against China and Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "OK. Congressman, we'd love to have you back for another conversation about cyber one time.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday we spoke with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and began our conversation by asking about the potential impact of the Trump administration's sweeping global tariffs on the security alliance.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "MARK RUTTE, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: There are tensions between the allies because of these - this tariffs question. But this is not concerning the alliance as a whole because there will be potentially impact on - on the economies, but not to an extent that it will impact our collective defense. That's my firm conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The next summit is now going to be held in June. And leaders there expected to hike the military budget spending goal from 2 percent to 3 percent. The Trump administration wants it all the way up to spending about 5 percent on a country's own defense.",
      "How do you convince members to spend more, to counter the threat from Russia, at a time when the U.S. is going closer to it and the U.S. is putting economic pressure on Europe?",
      "MARK RUTTE: What Trump has done since he came into office is break the deadlock when it comes to this terrible war in Ukraine because we've got to stop the killing. We have got to stop the fighting. And I commend him for that.",
      "And then when it comes to defense spending, last couple of months, here in the European side of NATO, it is staggering, the amount of billions coming in. We have to continue doing this because, as I said in December, if he would stick to the old 2 percent, we cannot defend ourselves here in three to five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at the same time that President Trump is calling for a peace deal in Ukraine, there is this parallel, separate effort to repair America's relationship with Russia. Doesn't the U.S. getting closer to Russia undercut your efforts to counter Russia?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Of course, I am - I am not in the room when all these talks take place. But what I am seeing from a - from distance and hearing from my American colleagues and all - including the president, whom I visited a couple weeks ago in a very successful meeting we had in the Oval Office and - and - and during lunch. There is this effort to bring this war to an end. The goal clearly is in the court of the Russians. They are not moving fast enough, is my impression, including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors. That - that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end. The Ukrainians are - are really close to the American position. And - and - and we have seen - we have to see how far the Americans can get this.",
      "But I am completely supporting that effort because this war of protection - - protection, it was unsustainable in the long term. So many people dying. So much of the Ukrainian infrastructure being damaged. Cities being destroyed. It's got to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: General Cavoli, who you know well as the supreme allied commander of NATO, the U.S. general, is here in Washington testifying this week. He said, \"Russia intends to diminish U.S. leadership and influence.\" What is happening to NATO members here? And - and is Russia succeeding in this destabilization campaign?",
      "MARK RUTTE: What we are seeing in Europe, but also in the U.S., but - but let me speak for the European side of NATO, is that the Russians, through cyberattacks, assassination attempts, jamming commercial airplanes in the Baltic area, cyberattacks on the national health service in the United Kingdom, cutting critical (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure between the Baltic countries and Finland, and in other parts of the Baltic - in the Baltic Sea. They are - they are conducting this campaign.",
      "The good news is that as NATO, as collective, we are much, much better, not only at assessing what is happening, but also making sure that we prevent the next steps in this campaign from happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that destabilization campaign has not halted or paused as these attempts to broker peace have been underway?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Well, I mean, this whole destabilization campaign is going on for years now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARK RUTTE: And I have no day to day assessment. But the reports we are getting is that Russia is still very active. We are still worried about, for example, (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure. But things do (INAUDIBLE). And in his role as supreme allied commander, we have in - in less than ten days brought together a big endeavor by European NATO allies in the - in the Baltic Sea to really make it very difficult for the Russians to continue doing this.",
      "And again they - they hate us for this. And - and I love that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are roughly about 90,000 or more U.S. troops stationed in Europe right now. Secretary Hegseth said Europe should not assume that presence is going to last forever. I know you say that the U.S. is committed to NATO, but do you have any sense of how fast or significant this kind of drawdown that's being mentioned by Hegseth could be? And is there NATO backup plan?",
      "MARK RUTTE: There are no concrete plans for the drawdown, but we know, and Pete Hegseth was very clear on this, is that this U.S. administration, but, by the way, this is U.S. policy since 2010, to pivot more towards Asia, towards the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MARK RUTTE: And agreement we have is that we will do whatever is necessary, and in surprises way. I completely acknowledge the fact that U.S. has, the United States, has more theaters to attend to, not only the Euro-Atlantic, but also the Indo-Pacific.",
      "And by the way, also thanks to President Trump and his position on this, as NATO we will be more and more active in the Indo-Pacific, with our partners. I will visit Japan next week to have my meetings there with the senior leadership to see how we can intensify that strong relationship we already have with the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised concern that China is building towards 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Is that a direct threat to NATO?",
      "MARK RUTTE: It is. It is a direct threat to the stability of the whole world, including NATO territory, absolutely. They have now more NATO ships sailing than the United States. We have a problem. The United States, part of NATO, Canadian part of NATO, European part of the NATO, that we are not producing enough defense industrial product. We are producing, in - in a full year in ammunition what Russia is producing in three months, that's totally crazy. And that's why the president and I discussed and the other senior leaders in the U.S. and I discussed also with European allies that we have not only to ramp up spending, but also the defense industrial production, that includes cutting the red tape, both in the U.S. and here in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just to quickly clarify that - China's nuclear arsenal is a direct threat to NATO?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Well, it's there not to be used against China. But I would say, amore generally, let's not be naive about China. The build up of their armed forces is taking place at a pace which is incredible. And when we talk about Ukraine and bringing Ukraine to a durable end and a peace, a durable peace in the end, let's not forget that Russia is working with North Korea and China and Iran, and that in the end it is an audience of one watching what comes out of this. And that is the first secretary of the communist party of China, Xi Jinping, and he will access when there is a deal on Ukraine, who comes out on top. Is it the west or is it Russia? And if it is Russia, he would get his thoughts going about his territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific. So, there are big risks involved. And that's why we have to bring Ukraine to a peace which is lasting and that Putin will never try this again.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see about 60% of Americans have money in the stock market, which mean that retirees could be just as concerned as hedge fund managers this morning. Did you expect this level of shock in the financial markets?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, you've got to realize this is a national security issue. I mean, we don't make medicine in this country anymore. We don't make ships. We don't have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right? All our semiconductors are made overseas. So every button we press when we try to start our car or even use our microwave, these are all semiconductors. They're all made elsewhere. We've got to start to protect ourselves, and we've got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and the rest of the world has a surplus with us. They're earning our money. They're taking our money, and Donald Trump has seen this, and he's going to stop it. So it is going to be a big change. Of course, it's going to be a big change, but the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years. Donald Trump has seen it. He's spoken about it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I understand that and--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --and he's just not going to take it anymore. And that's his model.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that was abundantly clear during the presidential campaign, how much the president truly believes in tariffs and putting them at the center of his economic policy, but you saw absolute panic in the global markets. Did you expect that or were you surprised?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike. The- the idea that all the countries of the world can run trade surpluses with America and buy our things with us\u2013 remember, $1.2 trillion. in 1980 we were a net investor- meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, it's a different world now, it's a different market.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: And now- and now they own 18- they own $18 trillion of us, net. So that means the rest of the- every year when we run a $1.2 trillion deficit, the rest of the world buys $1.2 trillion of America, and it goes up and up and up. And eventually we're not going to own America, and we are going to be owned by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking about--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Imagine if we had a war and we can't build a ship, we can't fly a plane. We can't build our own planes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --we don't have our own semiconductors. This is what the President is here to fix for America. It's- he- in his hands, and he wants to fix America. This is his chance--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. So--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --to fix America, and we need him to fix it for our children and our grandchildren.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but for- for businesses to do what you're doing, because what I hear you laying out there is a plan to re-industrialize the United States and to bring companies back to America. For a CEO to choose to invest--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well said. Well said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --but for a CEO to make those decisions- you know this- they need certainty. They need to know if it costs them more to stay overseas, or if it costs them more to move here. So can you give them clarity, so that they don't just cut jobs because they're dealing with the cost of these tariff- tariffs. Can you tell them how long they're staying in place?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Absolutely. The United States of America is going to protect the people who invest in America. Trillions and trillions of dollars- you heard the President speak about it- are coming to invest in America. This is the economy of the world. We are the consumer of the world, and companies need to build it here, and we will protect them for building it here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: We will help the American workers, yes. American workers are more expensive, but they're better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: We're going to protect all the factories that come to America, and that's what's coming here. So, the President is on it--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, is the 10% tariff permanent?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: He's going to protect them- well, remember, this is a national security issue--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I got it. Is the 10% tariff permanent?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --and he needs to address our budget deficit- that- the, you know, the laws of America are the laws of America, he would like it to be that we need to protect the companies that invest here, and we are going to protect the companies that invest here. That is the policy of the United States of America. That's why trillions of dollars are coming here. The rip off of the- of the United States of America is over. All these companies are going to come and invest here. That's what they're doing. That's why they've committed trillions of dollars. They know this is the economy--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Okay, Mr. Secretary, though--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --this is the place to go.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, the campaign's over. You won. So I'm asking what the plan is. So the treasury secretary said on another network, \"we're going to hold the course.\" \"It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.\" That makes it sound like the tariffs are staying in place at least for days or weeks. Is that correct? Or is the President considering postponing implementation to negotiate?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious. The president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. We are paying away our future and our lives. Come- the countries of the world are ripping us off, and it's got to end. The President has made it crystal, crystal clear. This is the policy we're going to protect. The factories that come build in America, \u00a0we're going to protect them. They're going to be successful. That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the earth. All of these companies are going to come and build here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when three of the President's other economic advisers, who are on other networks today, say that 50 different countries have been calling the White House to try to talk about the tariffs, what does that mean? Because that makes it sound like there is a negotiation, which is different from saying the tariffs are permanent.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, what it shows is that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end. Now the problem is, it's not just tariffs- like, I'll give you an example, like Vietnam said they'd like to be zero-zero. Remember, Vietnam sends us $120 billion worth of goods every year--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, cheap manufacturing",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: And we send them about $12 billion- wait, we send them $12 billion. So it's not the tariffs. It has nothing to do with tariffs. If they went to zero-zero, they would go to 200 billion with us. We need to stop the rip off, and zero-zero is- is the way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I know but we don't have zero-zero, sir.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --to make it more of a rip off. We need--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't have zero-zero actually, because when we saw the president stand in the Rose Garden holding up that chart that you helped make, that- that wasn't actually tariffs. That was actually confusing to investors, because it was some kind of other formula, and the countries themselves seemed kind of random. Like, why are the Heard and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face a 10% tariff? Did you use AI to generate this?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No. No, the idea- look, the idea is that there are no countries left off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are they on the list?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Because the idea- what happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us. Any country- like we had tariffs, the President put tariffs on China, right, in 2018, and then what China started doing is they started going through other countries to America. They just built through other countries, through America. And so, the President knows that, he's tired of it, and he's going to fix that. So basically he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through the Heard Islands.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --so the end of those loopholes- these ridiculous loopholes. And now what he's trying to say is, I'm going to fix the trade deficit of the United States of America. It's a national security issue. We need to make medicine. We need to make semiconductors. We need to make ships. We need to have steel and aluminum. Come on, we need the greatness of America to actually be built in America. And he's tired of getting ripped off by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but just to be clear, April 9, the so-called retaliatory tariffs- the reciprocal tariffs, I should say. Are those coming or are they open to negotiation?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming. He announced it, and he wasn't kidding. The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Is the administration considering any kind of offset, any kind of subsidy? You mentioned the first administration, there was some bailout to farmers to help them deal with the pain from Chinese retaliation. Are you looking at that now?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I'm- not that I've- I have not participated in any meetings with respect to that. The country is focused on- you realize, trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP. The factories being built in America are huge GDP--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That takes years--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: And that is going to matter to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said that robots are going to fill those jobs. So those aren't union worker jobs.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, it's really automated jobs. It's automated factories- automated factories. But the key is, who's going to build the factories? Who's going to operate the factories? Who's going to make them work? Great American workers. You know, we are going to replace--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said robots on other networks. You said that to FOX.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --the armies of millions of people- well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little- little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated and great Americans- the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They're going to be mechanics. There's going to be HVAC specialists. There's going to be electricians, the tradecraft of America. Our high school educated Americans- the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories, which are all coming to America. That's what's going to build our next generation of America.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned, in the time it will take for a company to move to America, that it will benefit China in the- in the immediate term, that other markets will look to other suppliers instead of dealing with the United States?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: That is ridiculous. The problem is, everyone in the world sells to us. Our economy is the consumer of the world. We are the only one with a trade deficit. The rest of the world has a trade surplus. Why does Europe have a trade surplus? Is there something about Europe that's special? Seriously, are they a different world than we are? Why are they selling 200 billion a year--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --more to us. It's because it's not fair. The rules are made not fair, and President Trump is going to fix them, and he's doing it for America, and he's doing it for your children and mine and our grandchildren. This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump's been talking about this his whole life. This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will take him at his word, quite literally. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your time this morning. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Washington state Senator Maria Cantwell, good to have you here.",
      "SEN. MARIA CANTWELL: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Senator, you heard the- the Senate whip talk about your effort to claw back some control over trade. He said it will have a thorough hearing, and we'll see where it goes from there. Do you have any indication of momentum among some of your Republican colleagues?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, the first day of introduction, we signed up seven Republicans. So usually you don't get a first introduction and get so many people on board, but I think it shows the anxiety that people have. I'm sure if they listen to their constituents, consumer challenges are already starting to surface, and certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people. So I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them. Today, consumer groups are announcing, and retailers, the fact that they want Congress to take this action up. And so I think we're hearing from a big segment of the economy, the consumer spending is a big part of GDP, and they're worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got what? Six Republicans at this point?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Seven.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Seven, and now you're saying retailers like you have CEOs who are on board, or industry groups.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Industry groups like the Retailers Association, the outdoor industry, the consumer electronics groups, Main Street Alliance, organizations who know their bread and butter comes from consumer spending, which is a big part of our economy, and so they are very anxious about a plan. Listen, I listened to your segment. I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life, and the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the letters and Greek- all the stuff that makes no sense. That's what people- consumers are saying. How is this helping me in a time of inflation? You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods. And so I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada and China are among your state's largest export markets. Both have- have already announced retaliatory tariffs. I know you've said previously that the first Trump administration and the more limited tariffs still to this day have an impact on your state. So how much wiggle room do we have with time here? Because you heard the commerce secretary say, basically, these aren't a negotiating ploy, that they are staying in place. That's what he says.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, I- I do--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how long before damage?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, we're- we have seen damage from the first Trump tariffs on things like apples and markets closed, and what you do is you end up then losing farm family economies. You don't necessarily lose farmland, some big corporation might buy it, but you lose family farms. So our objective should be to help farmers open up doors to these overseas markets. The United States' goal here should be to make great manufactured products and grow great agricultural products and then get those markets opened up. But what the president is doing is, instead of building those alliances, he basically is getting into a trade war that is having unbelievable impact. When his last tariffs on India- India, we reopened with the apple market, and we went to India and said, let's- let's get rid of this. And we were successful. And that's the kind of action we would have- we want to see today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your state is one of the top five unionized states in the country. You have the world's largest plane manufacturer, Boeing, in Washington. So I wonder if those union workers are as supportive of the tariffs as the auto industry workers have been. They are not against them, even though some are Democrats. In fact, they think, some of them, including on this program, like Shawn Fain, have been very supportive.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, we're seeing- you could get the letter from the Machinists International. They don't support the president on this, and that is because they understand how much the United States and Canada have become an integrated supply chain. That helped us lower the cost of U.S. manufacturing for cars and for airplanes, and lowering that cost means that we're even more competitive. So they don't like the uncertainty, and what they would like to see instead is the continuation of investment from the last administration. So when you think of CHIPS and Science, and you think of the Inflation Reduction Act that made investments in next generation technology, the sectors that have a lot of employees want to win on innovation. They know that investment and innovation will help us outpace our competition, not a tariff that makes the product more expensive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Boeing's CEO testified: 80% of the airplanes they deliver are to markets outside the U.S. 80% of the content of those airplanes are manufactured here. They have a vested interest in clearing the decks for themselves here. What are they telling you about their conversations with the administration?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, everybody's concerned that the administration might retaliate against them, that, you know, that if they're not front and center in this- in this debate, but they're clear that they are being heard. I think people are saying that their strategy is, if there's a demand for 40,000 airplanes, and we could increase 1,000 more planes being sold, it would have a huge impact on the trade deficit. So they're trying to say, Mr. President, don't cut the innovation and investment. Don't make semiconductors more expensive, don't make the parts more expensive, make it cheaper, and the United States bet on the American worker, and they will do the rest when it comes to the innovation that's required for America to build the best products. So I think the president's math is wrong. I think he doesn't know the calculus is going to be so devastating to American consumers, and that's why those groups are joining us today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cantwell, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Thank you.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Don Bacon, Republican of Nebraska, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Nebraska, Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who joins us this morning from Omaha. Congressman, I have a lot to get to with you on a number of topics here, but just to pick up on the tariffs that we've been speaking about, I know you are introducing companion legislation to what Senator Cantwell just laid out for us. But as I understand it, in the House, Republican leaders have already restricted the ability to rein in changes to the Mexico, Canada and China tariffs. They tucked language into the continuing resolution. Does that get in your way when you are trying to now claw back some congressional control of tariffs?",
      "REP. DON BACON: Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on. And I enjoyed listening to Senator Cantwell. I support the legislation that Senator Grassley, Senator Cantwell, we have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate, and I have some beginning support on the House side, which we'll unveil tomorrow. It will be harder to pass this in the House. No doubt. I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate, they'll put pressure on the House to look at this. And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction, or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill. So it will not pass tomorrow, or maybe in the next couple of weeks, but this will be in the queue that we can use, and it's time that Congress restores its authorities here. And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress, has the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch, and I think in hindsight, that was a mistake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I hear you saying you have some momentum. Respectfully, sir, that the president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to them. Did Republicans just not take him seriously?",
      "REP. BACON: There's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. It's a good question. You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republican-supported tariffs in the 1800s and up and through 1930 when we passed the Smoot-Hartley act that created one of the worst- well, the worst depression we ever had. We learned from that that tariffs and protectionism does not work, and that free trade in the end, as long as it's fair, we want fair trade. And I support the president wanting to get fairness, so these countries do treat us wrong, but fair trade should be the goal. And you're right. The president talked about this. He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. But here's my take on it, and I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. People voted for President Trump because of the border, and he has really delivered there. They voted for him too because inflation surpassed wage increases. They were poorer today than they were four years ago. I really think people voted for President Trump because of that, the border, and maybe crime, if they saw crime in the big cities. I don't think in the end- I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision making when it came to last November.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, I just- I know we certainly covered them on this program, and it is surprising to me, or perhaps it shouldn't be, that the business community is so silent right now. As Senator Cantwell said, she said they're afraid. But there is a conservative group, the new Civil Liberties Alliance, that filed suit to challenge these tariffs in court. Do you think it is the courts where this ultimately gets settled?",
      "REP. BACON: I think ultimately it's Congress, once we see enough of this, but maybe the courts as well. The Constitution makes it very clear Congress has control of taxes. And, by the way- and let's be candid, tariffs are a tax. But they also mention tariffs in the Constitution, and we gave the president emergency powers. So the courts will have to decide, is what- what just happened? Is this emergency powers, or is this a total change in tariff policy? And I think it's really the latter. This is where Congress has to step in and say, do we really want to create this new policy on tariffs? And if it is, it should come from the Congress and not the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your work on the Armed Services Committee. President Trump has fired the top two officials at the head of the very powerful National Security Agency. It's one of the most powerful intelligence agencies we have. It vacuums up information around the world through wiretapping, signals intercepts, and they work with the military, with Cyber Command. Have you received any explanation to Congress as to why General Haugh, the four star general unanimously confirmed to the job, was suddenly dismissed?",
      "REP. BACON: Margaret, I have not. But let me just comment on this. General Haugh is the absolute best leader in the US military to lead Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. He commanded both because half of Cyber Command relies on NSA to be effective in cyber operations, so you have to have this team. And he was in charge of both. He served 34 years in the military, and his entire career was working signals intelligence or cyber operations. Frankly, he is the best that we had. And they also fired the number two person at the National Security Agency without an explanation. I will tell you, this puts us back. It hurts us. I will tell you, Russia and China today are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified guys that we spent three and a half decades preparing to have this role, and he's gone. And it's- it's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without explanation, and it hurt us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And our reporting as a network is that it came as a decision following an Oval Office meeting with a right-wing activist named Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about 9/11, said anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant things, racist things. It also happened as at least six other National Security Council officials at the White House were dismissed on the advice of Laura Loomer. I'm wondering again, respectfully, sir, Republicans are in control. You have oversight. Are there going to be hearings on this? Are there other Republicans who are concerned and going to do something about it?",
      "REP. BACON: I'm sure there'll be some oversight. I'm the chairman of the Cyber Subcommittee, and so I guarantee you that we will have various military leaders, we'll have the Secretary of Defense speak to us, and He will be asked about this--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Did he even know?",
      "REP. BACON: I don't know that he know, but we'll find out when we ask him, and we'll ask. They'll say that this is the president's right, and the president does have constitutional right to do this, but does it make it appropriate or okay? He may have the constitutional authority to do it, but does it make it right? And in the end, I'm going to make it clear we just removed the most qualified military leader that we had to run Cyber Command and NSA, and we will ask about it. Now, we have oversight, doesn't mean we can- the president does have the constitutional authority to do this, but we have- we have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why. And I have a responsibility to make clear this is wrong. It hurt us. It hurt our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly. Do you think it is so that the president can split up those two commands and put someone of his own choosing, a political ally, at the top of the NSA?",
      "REP. BACON: You know it's possible. I know that's out there, but I would say that's a mistake. NSA is very important to Cyber Command. You cannot do Cyber Command without the inputs from the National Security Agency, the SIGINT. If you separate, put them under two different commands, then you're gonna create a dysfunctional partnership and will hurt our cyber operations against China and Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, Congressman, we'd love to have you back for another conversation about cyber one time. We have to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the full interview with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Secretary General of NATO Mark Rutte in Brussels. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "NATO SECRETARY GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Good morning. Good to be on the program.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you've been a busy man this week. And I know NATO is a defensive alliance, it's not a trade alliance. And you and Secretary Rubio have repeatedly said this trade war is not impacting NATO. But respectfully, how could this tension between allies not have any impact? And are you concerned at all that European countries will move towards other, perhaps cheaper, markets like China?",
      "RUTTE: I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact on individual allies, but it does not have an impact on the alliance. There, Marco Rubio and I are on the same page, because the alliance is focused on making sure we can fight the Russian threat. We can make sure that we can bring Ukraine, as much as possible, collectively under U.S. leadership, to a durable and lasting peace, and that is our laser focus of the last couple of days.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: George Marshall \u2014 in Europe, you know, the man who was responsible for the Marshall Plan and helping to rebuild after World War Two, linked economic health to political stability and peace. Don't these tensions make your job a little bit harder?",
      "RUTTE: To be honest, I don't believe so. Yes, you're right, there are tensions between allies because of this- this tariff question, but this is not concerning the alliance as a whole, because there will be potentially impact on the economies, but not to an extent that it will impact our collective defense. That's my firm conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Because there is this request from the United States and a call you have made yourself to increase spending on defense. Right? So the next summit is now going to be held in June, and leaders there are expected to hike the military budget spending goal from 2% to 3%. The Trump administration wants it all the way up to spending about 5% on a country's own defense. So you're asking for that. At the same time the United States is repairing its relationship with Russia. How do you convince members to spend more to counter the threat from Russia, at a time when the U.S. is going closer to it, and the U.S. is putting economic pressure on Europe?",
      "RUTTE: Well, first on the U.S. Russia question. What Trump has done since he came into office is break the deadlock when it comes to this terrible war in Ukraine, because we've got to stop the killing, we've got to stop the fighting, and I commend him for that. And- and I must say, allies here in the last couple of days meeting with Foreign Ministers are fully supporting the U.S. effort to bring this war to a fair and durable and lasting end. And we'll see \u2014 we have to see how far we can get.",
      "But I mean, the fact that day at night, the American administration is working on that is- is important. And then when it comes to defense spending the last couple of months here in the European side of NATO, it is staggering the amount of billions coming in. It- it- you have to compare this to the days of the Cold War, when you look at the overall defense spending now being ramped up in Europe- and we have to continue doing this, because, as I said in December, if we would stick to the old 2% we cannot defend ourselves here in three to five years. But with the billions \u2014 literally hundreds of billions coming in now from the Europeans, from \u2014 from \u2014 for example, Germany, half a trillion, and so many other European allies. It's really impressive, and \u2014 and that will help us to one, have a stronger NATO, because we spend more and we produce more.",
      "But secondly, also in NATO, which is fair because- and this is to President Trump's point, it means that we have more equality in terms of what you're spending on defense, and what we are spending here on the European side of NATO on defense. And we need that to become more lethal as an organization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at the same time that President Trump is calling for a peace deal in Ukraine, there is this parallel, separate effort to repair America's relationship with Russia. Reopening diplomatic facilities is being discussed. Just this week Kirill Dmitriev, an ally of President Putin who's under sanctions, was here in Washington meeting with Steve Witkoff, as you know. He said in television interviews, the U.S. and Russia could work together on counterterrorism, in the Arctic and develop rare earths in Russia together. So doesn't the U.S. getting closer to Russia undercut your efforts to counter Russia?",
      "RUTTE: Well, I'm not sure I completely would share your assessment on what the U.S. and Russia are doing at the moment. Of course, I'm not in the room when all these talks take place, but what I'm seeing from a distance and hearing from my American colleagues and- including the President, whom I visited a couple of weeks ago in a very successful meeting we had in the Oval Office and then during lunch. There is this effort to bring this war to an end. And as part of that effort, the U.S. is really trying to- to- and- and at this moment, as we speak, this is Friday. Maybe this has changed on Sunday when you air this, but on Friday, the ball clearly is in the court of the Russians. They are not moving fast enough, is my impression, including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors, that- that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end.",
      "The Ukrainians are really close to the American position. And we have seen- we have to see how far the Americans can get this. But I am completely supporting that effort, because this war of protection- protection, it was unsustainable in the long term, so many people dying, so much of the Ukrainian infrastructure being damaged, cities being destroyed. This got to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you just mentioned Secretary Rubio, who, on Friday, said the Trump administration wanted a complete ceasefire in Ukraine, but the Russians would only agree to a partial one. The U.S. took it because he said, quote, \"it's better than nothing.\" Are you concerned that Russia is dictating terms?",
      "RUTTE:\u00a0 No, I'm not, because I spoke with Marco Rubio, I'm in regular contact with the other members of the American administration. I think you guys are really trying, step-by-step, to get to a situation where this war can end. But of course, the Russia- Russians also have to dance the tango, and at this moment they don't seem to do so, and then it will be difficult. But, the fact that you guys are trying, that the American administration is all the power you can project- project on the world stage. You are trying this because we know that- that the front line was moving in the wrong direction. We know that this war was moving in the wrong direction. This was- this was not going to end well, and already so many people were- were dying, so I really commend your American efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Is it your assessment, is it NATO's assessment that Vladimir Putin is not considering ending his invasion of Ukraine?",
      "RUTTE: Well, we don't know. I think this is the test now, and we have to see \u2014",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- What happens if he's not? Do you know what \u2014",
      "RUTTE: \u2014 what his reaction will be to the American proposals.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, what's the consequence? Do you know?",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "RUTTE: So it's difficult for me to assess, but clearly we have to take this step by step. And until January this year, nothing happened when it came to bringing this war to an end. When Trump came in- President Trump came in after his inauguration, he started this process. And- and it- it might take longer than we would want to, but the fact that he tries is therefore also testing the Russians whether they are serious in this. We have to see over the coming weeks how far he can get it, and I'm supporting it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. General Cavoli, who you know well as the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, the U.S. generals here in Washington testifying this week. He said Russia intends to diminish U.S. leadership and influence. It is actively conducting a destabilization campaign within Europe right now to create strategic dilemmas for the U.S. What is happening to NATO members here, and is Russia succeeding in this destabilization campaign?",
      "RUTTE: Chris Cavoli is the supreme allied commander. He is- he is absolutely right. What we are seeing in Europe, but also in the U.S., but let me speak for the European side of NATO, is that the Russians through cyberattacks, assassination attempts, jamming commercial airplanes in the Baltic area, cyberattacks on the national health service in the United Kingdom, cutting critical undersea infrastructure between Baltic countries and Finland and in other parts of the Baltic, in the Baltic Sea. They are conducting this campaign. The good news is that as NATO, as collective, we are much, much better, not only at assessing what is happening, but also making sure that we prevent the next steps in this campaign from happening. And the Russians hate us for that, and we have to do this so Cavoli is completely right here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that destabilization campaign has not halted or paused as these attempts to broker peace have been underway?",
      "RUTTE: Well, I mean, this whole destabilization campaign is going on for years now and I have no day-to-day assessment, whether it is on a scale from 1 to 10 at number 9, or number 3. But the reports we are getting is that the Russians still very active. We are still worried about, for example, the critical undersea infrastructure. But thanks to Chris Cavoli and in his role as Supreme Allied Commander, we have, in less than 10 days, brought together a big endeavor by European NATO allies in the- in the Baltic Sea to really make it very difficult for the Russians to continue doing this. And again, they- they hate us for this, and I love that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are roughly about 90,000 or more U.S. troops stationed in Europe right now. Secretary Hegseth said Europe should not assume that presence is going to last forever. I know you say that the U.S. is committed to NATO, but do you have any sense of how fast or significant this kind of drawdown that's being mentioned by Hegseth could be, and is there a NATO backup plan?",
      "RUTTE: There are no concrete plans for the drawdown. What we know, and Pete Hegseth was very clear on this, is that this U.S. administration- but by the way, this is U.S. policy since 2010 to pivot more towards Asia, towards the Indo-Pacific. And the agreement we have is that we will do whatever is necessary in a no surprises way. So if it is necessary to draw down or to pivot more towards Asia, to do it in a way that we can really compensate for that, take time, do it step by step, because that is important, because then this concerns the overall defense and the terms of NATO territory.",
      "And at the same time, I completely acknowledge the fact that U.S. has, the United States, has more theaters to attend to, not only the Euro-Atlantic, but also the Indo-Pacific. And by the way, also, thanks to President Trump and his position on this, as NATO, we will be more and more active in the Indo-Pacific with our partners. I will visit Japan next week to have my meetings there with the senior leadership to see how we can intensify that strong relationship we already have with the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about nuclear deterrence. The US and UK are declared nuclear powers, and they give, by extension, NATO some protection. The leaders of Germany, of Poland and France have recently said things about expanding a nuclear umbrella because they are concerned that America isn't going to be as committed to their defense. Have you had any conversations about an alternative to the US nuclear umbrella, or bringing France's arsenal into it?",
      "RUTTE:\u00a0 No, I didn't. And \u2014 and Marco Rubio this week basically repeated what President Trump has said three times now on television: that- that the US is completely committed to NATO, is completely committed to Article Five. That includes the US being the ultimate guarantor, through the nuclear deterrent, for NATO territory, including, and particularly of course, the European part of NATO \u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --So the French are wrong when they raise that?",
      "RUTTE: --And what I'm urging my European colleagues to do is to put on the television and sometimes listen to the senior American leadership when it comes to NATO, instead of worrying constantly about, 'Is- is the US still committed to NATO?' The answer is yes, it has been consistently coming out of the American system over the last three months. Including the expectation that on the European side of NATO and the Canadian side, we will continue ramping up defense spending, because that is only fair, and we are doing it. And that's the good news.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's not my assessment. That was the leaders of France, Poland, and Germany, sir, as you know. You've raised concern that China is building towards 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Is that a direct threat to NATO?",
      "RUTTE: It is. It is a direct threat to the stability in the whole world, including NATO territory, absolutely. They have now more navy ships sailing than the United States. We have a problem, the United States part of NATO, the Canadian part of NATO, European part of NATO, that we are not producing enough defense industrial products. We are producing in a full year in ammunition what Russia is producing in three months. Russia has only 5% of NATO economy, compared. So we are 20 times bigger, the overall NATO economy, than Russia, and Russia is producing four times more in ammunition than the whole of NATO is producing in a year. That's- that's totally crazy, and that's why the President and I discussed, and the other senior leaders in the U.S. and I discussed, also with European allies, that we have not only to ramp up spending, but also the defense industrial production. That includes cutting the red tape, both in the U.S. and here in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to quickly clarify, China's nuclear arsenal is a direct threat to NATO?",
      "RUTTE: Well, it- it's there not to be used against China. So it is there as a deterrence or whatever the goal is. But I would say more generally, let's not be naive about China. The build up of their armed forces is taking place at a pace which is incredible. And when we talk about Ukraine, and bringing Ukraine to a durable end and a peace, a durable peace in the end, let's not forget that Russia is working with North Korea and China and Iran. And that in the end, there is an audience of one watching what comes out of this. And that is the first Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping. And he will assess, when there is a deal on Ukraine, who comes out on top: is it the West, or is it Russia? And if it is Russia, he would get his thoughts going about his territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific. And we know he has them. Take Taiwan, etc. So there are big risks involved, and that's why we have to bring Ukraine to a peace which is lasting, and that Putin will never try this again.",

    "story": [
      "NATO's top official says Russia needs to move more quickly to end the war in Ukraine, and he's been told by the U.S. that Moscow must \"do more.\"",
      "\"The ball clearly is in the court of the Russians,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview\u00a0that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday. \"They are not moving fast enough, is my impression \u2014 including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors, that \u2014 that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end.\"",
      "Rutte, who spoke with Brennan Friday, said the U.S. and its allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are in lockstep on countering Russia and are working in tandem to secure an end to the war in Ukraine and Russian aggression.",
      "He lauded the White House for prioritizing trying to \"break the deadlock\" in Ukraine, where Russia's invasion has been grinding on since 2022, resulting in hundreds of thousands of casualties and the wholesale destruction of cities and towns.",
      "\"I spoke with Marco Rubio, I'm in regular contact with the other members of the American administration. I think you guys are really trying, step-by-step, to get to a situation where this war can end,\" Rutte said, before questioning Russia's commitment to the process.",
      "\"Russians also have to dance the tango, and at this moment they don't seem to do so,\" Rutte said, while the Ukrainians \"are really close to the American position.\"",
      "Russia has not yet agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and has said there are still outstanding issues that must be resolved first.",
      "Rubio, who is attending a NATO conference in Brussels, told reporters Friday, \"We will know from their answers very soon whether they are serious about proceeding with real peace or whether it's a delay tactic. Now we've reached the stage where we need to make progress.\"",
      "Rutte said it was President Trump's inauguration that kickstarted the peace process, telling Brennan that \"until January this year, nothing happened when it came to bringing this war to an end.\"",
      "The two sides and the U.S. are working to hammer out the details of a partial ceasefire.",
      "NATO and the Trump tariffs",
      "Rutte said that he does not believe Mr. Trump's global tariffs, which slammed Europe and many allies, will harm the military alliance.",
      "\"I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact on individual allies, but it does not have an impact on the alliance,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview recorded Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "He added that it's \"my firm conviction\" that a potential trade war will not affect Europe's defense spending or commitment to NATO.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently criticized NATO countries for spending less than 2% of their gross domestic product on defense and in his second administration pushed for members to more than double their defense spending to 5%.",
      "Rutte argued Friday that European countries have already ramped up their spending.",
      "\"It is staggering the amount of billions coming in. It \u2014you have to compare this to the days of the Cold War, when you look at the overall defense spending now being ramped up in Europe,\" Rutte said.",
      "Nuclear deterrence",
      "Pressed by Brennan over statements made by the leaders of Germany, Poland and France about expanding a western European nuclear umbrella \u2014 beyond the assurances of protection provided by the U.S. and United Kingdom \u2014 Rutte said he's confident in the U.S.' nuclear security guarantee.",
      "\"Marco Rubio this week basically repeated what President Trump has said three times now on television: that the U.S. is completely committed to NATO, is completely committed to Article 5,\" Rutte said. \"That includes the U.S. being the ultimate guarantor, through the nuclear deterrent, for NATO territory, including, and particularly of course, the European part of NATO.\" Article 5 says that an attack on any NATO member country is an attack on all members.",
      "Rutte said the Trump administration has \"consistently\" said it is committed to the alliance.",
      "\"What I'm urging my European colleagues to do is to put on the television and sometimes listen to the senior American leadership when it comes to NATO,\" Rutte said. \"Instead of worrying constantly about, 'Is the U.S. still committed to NATO?' The answer is yes, it has been consistently coming out of the American system over the last three months.\"",

      "President Trump will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Monday, several people familiar with the meeting confirmed to CBS News on Saturday.",
      "The leaders are expected to focus on the latest Israeli military operations in Gaza and new U.S. tariffs announced by Mr. Trump against Israel and other countries.",

      "\"The Prime Minister appreciates the personal and warm relationship with President Trump, and thanks him for inviting him to be the first leader to meet with him after the imposition of global tariffs, just as he was the first leader to meet with him after entering the White House,\" the statement read.",
      "This would be their second meeting of Mr. Trump's second term. The two last met in Washington, D.C. in February, when Mr. Trump unveiled his plan for the U.S. to \"take over Gaza\" and turn it into \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\"",

      "Meanwhile, Israel says it has deployed troops to a newly established security corridor across Southern Gaza. Netanyahu announced the new Morag Corridor on Saturday and suggested it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel has ordered evacuated, from the rest of Gaza.",
      "A military statement Saturday said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed in the corridor. It was not immediately clear how many had deployed or where exactly the corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu suggested it would run between the cities.",
      "Maps published by Israeli media showed the new corridor running the width of the narrow coastal strip from east to west.",
      "Netanyahu said it would be \"a second Philadelphi corridor,\" referring to the Gaza side of the border with Egypt further south, which has been under Israeli control since last May.",
      "Israel has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Hamas says situation is \"highly dangerous\" for hostages",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked\u00a0the war in Gaza, said Friday that Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza was creating a \"highly dangerous\" situation for the hostages still held there. It warned that half of the living captives were in areas where the Israeli army had ordered evacuations.",
      "\"Half of the living Israeli (hostages) are located in areas that the Israeli occupation army has requested to be evacuated in recent days,\" Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said in a statement, AFP reported. \"We have decided not to transfer these (hostages)... but (this situation) is highly dangerous to their lives.\"",
      "Hamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "To pressure Hamas, Israel has imposed\u00a0a monthlong blockade\u00a0on food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel said earlier this week that enough food had entered Gaza during a six-week truce to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for a long time.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Republicans adopted a budget resolution on Saturday after an all-night voting marathon, putting Congress one step closer to enacting President Trump's agenda.",
      "Senate Republicans unveiled a new 70-page budget blueprint Wednesday that lays out a path toward implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. The resolution aims to make tax cuts that were enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent while also authorizing $1.5 trillion in additional tax cuts and raising the debt ceiling by as much as $5 trillion.",
      "The Senate cleared a procedural hurdle Thursday with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky as the only Republican defection, setting it up for final approval this weekend after senators exhausted all amendment votes during what's known as a \"vote-a-rama.\"",
      "During the vote-a-rama, Democrats offered amendments that forced the majority party to cast vote after vote through the night on highly charged political issues, including Medicaid, Social Security and tariffs. The Senate adopted the resolution in a 51-48 vote, teeing it up for a vote in the House as soon as next week. Paul and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine were the only two Republicans who voted against it.",
      "The Republican blueprint is just the first step in the complicated reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance legislation in the Senate. Taking this route allows Republicans to pass the bill without help from Democrats. Both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions that direct committees to submit their proposed spending plans before passing a bill meeting Mr. Trump's priorities. The entire process is expected to take months.",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 ranking GOP senator, said voters gave Republicans a mission in November, and the Senate budget plan delivers.",
      "\"It fulfills our promises to secure the border, to rebuild our economy and to restore peace through strength,\" Barrasso said, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement Saturday that Congress was taking \"smart action to strengthen America's economy and repeal wasteful government spending.\"",
      "\"By advancing this budget resolution, the Senate sends a strong signal to every small business and every working family: President Trump's economic agenda will provide long-term tax certainty,\" he said. \"I look forward to working with House leadership to finish this crucial first step and unlock legislation that strengthens our economic and fiscal foundations.\"",
      "The compromise resolution comes after Republicans in the House and Senate forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, before coming together on the path forward. Still, differences exist over where and how to make spending cuts, as leaders have opted to push some of the lingering disagreements down the line.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just a few billion dollars, while it calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in the House. The Senate is expected to find far more than the floor outlined in the resolution, but the figures are aimed at giving them flexibility moving forward.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune defended the resolution on Thursday as laying the groundwork for \"transformational investment\" in border security, national defense and the energy sector.",
      "The South Dakota Republican criticized Democrats, whom he said are \"losing their minds\" over the measure, for claiming the tax relief is \"about handouts to billionaires.\" He said Democrats' \"latest hysteria\" centers on an accounting tactic known as a \"current policy baseline,\" which makes it appear as if making the tax cuts permanent costs nothing.",
      "\"Using the current policy baseline is not some bizarre new gimmick,\" Thune said, adding that \"Democrats' sudden concern for saving money and protecting the character of the Senate is touching.\"",
      "But Congress usually uses a \"current law baseline\" for budget measures, as required under the 1974 Budget Control Act. This takes into account the expiration of spending provisions. So, the current policy would treat the extension of the Trump tax cuts, which are expiring this year, as a policy that will continue indefinitely and won't cost any new taxpayer dollars. However, the tax cuts were passed in accordance with a current law baseline, which set an expiration date. So extending the cuts would mean incurring new costs, in this case, about $4.5 trillion over the next decade.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Thursday that \"Republicans, in essence, want to pretend like their trillion dollar tax cuts are free \u2014 like magic.\"",
      "\"Middle school math students would tell you this is ridiculous,\" Schumer said.",

      "Thursday's lawsuit is the fourth against the executive order issued just a week ago. It seeks to block key aspects of it, including new requirements that people provide documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and a demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day.",
      "\"The President has no power to do any of this,\" the state attorneys general wrote in court documents. \"The Elections EO is unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields responded to the lawsuit Friday, calling the proof-of-citizenship requirements \"common sense\" and objections from Democrats \"insane.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration is standing up for free, fair, and honest elections and asking this basic question is essential to our Constitutional Republic,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Trump's order said the U.S. has failed \"to enforce basic and necessary election protection.\" Election officials have said recent elections have been among the most secure in U.S. history. There has been no indication of any widespread fraud, including when Trump, a Republican, lost to Joe Biden, a Democrat, in 2020.",
      "The order is the culmination of Trump's longstanding complaints about how U.S. elections are run. After his first win in 2016, Trump falsely claimed his popular vote total would have been much higher if not for \"millions of people who voted illegally.\" In 2020, Trump blamed a \"rigged\" election for his loss and falsely claimed widespread voter fraud and manipulation of voting machines.",
      "Trump has argued his order secures the vote against illegal voting by noncitizens, though multiple studies and investigations in the states have shown that it's rare.",
      "The order has received praise from the top election officials in some Republican states who say it could inhibit instances of voter fraud and will give them access to federal data to better maintain their voter rolls.",
      "The order also requires states to exclude any mail-in or absentee ballots received after Election Day, and it puts states' federal funding at risk if election officials don't comply. Some states count ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day or allow voters to correct minor errors on their ballots.",
      "Forcing states to change, the suit says, would violate the broad authority the Constitution gives states to set their own election rules. It says they decide the \"times, places and manner\" of how elections are run.",

      "The attorney general and secretary of state in Nevada, a presidential battleground, defended their state's elections as fair, secure and transparent, and they objected to the president's attempt to interfere in how they are run. Attorney General Aaron Ford praised Nevada's automatic systems for registering voters and distributing mail ballots.",
      "\"While this order is on its face unconstitutional and illegal, it is also unnecessary,\" he said.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts by the Democratic attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "Other lawsuits filed over the order argue it could disenfranchise voters because millions of eligible voting-age Americans do not have the proper documents readily available. People are already required to attest to being citizens, under penalty of perjury, in order to vote.",
      "Under the order, documents acceptable to prove citizenship would be a U.S. passport, a REAL ID-compliant driver's license that \"indicates the applicant is a citizen,\" and a valid photo ID as long as it is presented with proof of citizenship.",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",

      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court's order that required the Trump administration to return a\u00a0Maryland man\u00a0who was\u00a0mistakenly arrested\u00a0and removed to El Salvador back to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday.",
      "Roberts' administrative stay gives the Supreme Court more time to consider the matter and will remain in place \"pending further order of the undersigned or of the court,\" it states. He issued his order hours after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the\u00a0legal battle over the removal of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia last month.",
      "The Justice Department's request for emergency relief from the high court came as it faced a court-ordered 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. He was deported to a Salvadoran supermax prison on March 15 despite a 2019 protective order that should have prevented him from being sent to the country.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block that district court order, claiming that it \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it cannot compel El Salvador to \"follow a federal judge's bidding.\"",
      "\"The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the Justice Department welcomed the chief justice's stay \"as we continue to fight this case and protect the executive branch from judicial overreach.\"",
      "The dispute over Abrego Garcia's removal sparked widespread attention and outrage after the Trump administration admitted in a court filing last week that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\" The 29-year-old father was removed from the U.S. on a series of deportation flights transporting hundreds of people to the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a separate high-profile court battle involving President Trump's attempts to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a separate request from the Justice Department to allow it to resume deportations using the seldom-invoked authority.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old, according to court records. In 2019, he was arrested alongside three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities while an immigration judge examined his case.",
      "During a bond hearing before the immigration judge, the Department of Homeland Security put forth evidence claiming that a \"proven and reliable source\" confirmed Abrego Garcia had ties to the MS-13 gang. The judge denied his request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have argued in court filings that the only evidence of his alleged gang ties came from a confidential informant who claimed he was an active member of MS-13 and the fact that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and sweatshirt when he was arrested. They also said Abrego Garcia has no criminal history. \"He has never been charged or convicted of any criminal charges, in the United States, El Salvador, or any other country,\" his lawyers wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from federal custody after another immigration judge granted him a \"withholding of removal\" to El Salvador, a legal status that bars officials from removing individuals who prove they are more likely than not to be subject to persecution in their home country. In the order, the judge found that if Abrego Garcia returned to El Salvador, he would likely face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife told CBS News that her husband attended regular check-ins with immigration authorities after he was released and was working as a sheet metal worker. But he was arrested again on March 12 because of what the Trump administration said was his \"prominent role\" in MS-13 and questioned about his ties to the group, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated as a \"foreign terrorist organization\" in February.",
      "Abrego Garcia was then transferred to a detention facility in Texas, his wife said, and then placed on the flight to El Salvador on March 15.",
      "While the Trump administration acknowledged that it erred in removing Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it opposed efforts to bring him back to the U.S. because of his alleged affiliation with MS-13. The Justice Department has also argued that the government does not have jurisdiction over Abrego Garcia anymore because he is in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "A federal judge in Maryland held a hearing on the challenge to Abrego Garcia's removal, and ultimately ordered the administration to return him to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday. During the proceedings, a Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, conceded that Abrego Garcia \"should not have been removed,\" and said he was \"frustrated\" by a lack of information from the Trump administration as to why Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities. Reuveni was placed on administration leave in the wake of the hearing.",
      "The judge, Paula Xinis, issued a scathing opinion Sunday that said the federal government \"confessed grievous error\" that \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and asked it to swiftly put Xinis' order requiring Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S. on hold.",
      "Sauer then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court. His request for the high court to block Xinis' decision came just before the 4th Circuit rejected the administration's request to step into the dispute.",
      "The solicitor general, who was confirmed to the role last week, called the district court's decision \"unprecedented and indefensible,\" and claimed the the lower courts are trying to \"seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight.\"",

    "summary": "The redeployment comes after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak in Texas.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S. will apply an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee on American products.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social app, Mr. Trump said that \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"",
      "He added, \"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax applied to all products shipped to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the\u00a0new taxes\u00a0are needed to erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to members of the European Union.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.",
      "Last year, the U.S. imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China, ranging from Apple iPhones to clothing, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Excluding the threat of an added 50% levy on Chinese imports, American consumers could face higher costs of about $3,789 per year due to the previously announced tariffs, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Consumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods. Because of those dynamics, many economists say inflation is likely to reignite this year.",
      "Wall Street has been spooked by Mr. Trump's growing trade war, with economists warning that the conflict could slam economic growth and even potentially trigger a recession.",

    "summary": "The House speaker suffered an embarrassing defeat during a procedural vote last week that would have killed the Florida congresswoman's discharge petition.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson reached a deal with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna amid her push to allow new parents to vote remotely, which paralyzed the House last week and threatened to delay a key vote on President Trump's agenda in the coming days.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, announced Sunday she and Johnson had a deal to use vote pairing \u2014 an agreement between an absent member and a member who is physically present and plans to vote on the opposite side of the question, effectively canceling out the vote. The present member casts their vote, then withdraws it and announces that they have paired with the absent member. The vote is not included in the vote total, but their positions are published in the Congressional Record.",
      "\"It will be open for the entire conference to use when unable to vote (e.g., new parents, bereaved, emergencies, etc.),\" Luna wrote Sunday.",
      "Johnson said Monday the solution is \"no harm, no foul\" and \"solved her concerns, so that's a great thing.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suffered an embarrassing loss to kill the effort to allow new parents to vote remotely around the birth of their child. Johnson, who considers proxy voting to be unconstitutional, said any further floor action was halted and sent members home.",
      "A deal could allow House leaders to move ahead on other legislative priorities this week, including holding a vote on a Republican budget blueprint that passed the Senate over the weekend.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in Thursday on the debate, telling reporters that he supported Luna's effort to allow new parents to vote remotely. But a day later, Johnson wrote on social media that Mr. Trump told him, \"Mike, you have my proxy on proxy voting.\"",
      "The measure to allow new parents to vote remotely was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January. The bill would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.",
      "Luna, a cosponsor of the bill, moved to bypass leadership and launched a\u00a0discharge petition, a procedural move that allows a measure to move forward without the speaker's approval, to force a vote on it. The discharge petition quickly reached the threshold needed to force a vote, with 206 Democrats and 11 other Republicans signing on.",
      "But Republicans tried to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security to table her discharge petition. Nine Republicans joined all Democrats during a procedural vote Tuesday to help sink it.",
      "Pettersen said in a statement Monday that the agreement between Luna and Johnson \"does not address the barriers we've fought so hard to overcome.\"",
      "\"Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don't have a voice,\" she said of Johnson. \"Let's be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called Republicans' opposition to allowing new mothers to vote remotely \"a strange hill to die on.\"",
      "\"What is the Republican problem with allowing expectant mothers to vote on behalf of their constituents?\" the New York Democrat said Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.",

      "The deaths since the storms began on Wednesday included 10 in Tennessee, which saw powerful tornadoes spring up from an initial wave of storms last week and continued to face heavy flooding through the weekend.

    "story": [
      "President Trump has vehemently defended the sweeping tariffs unveiled by his administration on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, even as they threaten to spark a global trade war and have sent\u00a0stock markets tumbling around the world.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",

      "In addition to the baseline tax, Mr. Trump had said China would face a \"reciprocal\" levy of 34%, and in response to Beijing's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, the president has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on China if it does not lift those duties by Tuesday.",
      "As markets fall, and with his\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "No pause in tariffs",
      "During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "The president also said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",

On April 7, Mr. Trump shot back at China by saying he plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to add retaliatory import duties.",

      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",

      "\"I'm fighting for my life here,\" Vallow Daybell\u00a0told CBS affiliate AZFamily's True Crime Arizona correspondent Briana Whitney in a jailhouse interview ahead of opening statements.",
      "Jury selection in the Arizona case began on Monday, March 31. About 200 potential jurors were screened,\u00a0AZFamily reported, but many were ruled out by Vallow Daybell and prosecutors because they knew about the case. Sixteen jurors, including four alternates, were chosen. The jury is made up of 13 men and three women, AZFamily reported.",
      "AZFamily has been permitted by the judge to stream the trial on a 30-minute delay. The trial is expected to last until mid-May at the latest.",
      "What did Lori Vallow Daybell do?",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in prison without parole in the killings of her children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua Jaxon \"JJ\" Vallow. Tylee was Vallow Daybell's child from a previous relationship. She and Charles Vallow adopted JJ in 2012.",
      "In 2018, Vallow Daybell met doomsday fiction author Chad Daybell. A year later, she separated from Vallow and began a relationship with Daybell.",
      "The couple held apocalyptic religious beliefs that prosecutors claimed were used to justify the killings of Tylee, JJ and Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell.",
      "Tylee and JJ disappeared within two weeks of each other in September 2019. In October 2019, Tammy Daybell was found dead in her bed. A coroner said her death initially appeared to be due to natural causes, but an autopsy wasn't conducted before her body was buried. Two weeks later, in November 2019, Daybell and Vallow Daybell were married in Hawaii.",
      "The remains of Tammy Daybell were exhumed in December 2019, an autopsy was performed and her cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation. In February 2020, Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii for ignoring a police order to produce her children, who had been reported missing by their grandparents. Several months later, in June 2020, the bodies of Tylee and JJ were found on a property owned by Chad Daybell.",
      "Daybell and Vallow Daybell were each charged in the deaths of Tammy Daybell, Tylee and JJ. In separate trials, they were each found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the children's deaths. Vallow Daybell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in Tammy Daybell's death and of theft charges related to financial payments sent to her children.",
      "Daybell was found guilty of murder in Tammy Daybell's death, as well as several other related charges. He has been sentenced to death.",
      "What was Lori Vallow Daybell's relationship with Charles Vallow?",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell and Charles Vallow were married from 2006 to 2019.",
      "In early 2019, Vallow became very worried about his wife. He went to the police with his concerns, telling them that Vallow Daybell believed she was a \"god\" who was preparing for the end of days.",
      "\"She threatened me, murder me, kill me,\" he told police in a conversation recorded on video, according to \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Vallow filed for divorce in February 2019. In the filing, he said that Vallow Daybell had threatened to murder him. He also expressed fears for JJ and Tylee's safety.",
      "How did Charles Vallow die?",
      "Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow Daybell's brother, Alexander Lamar Cox, on July 11, 2019.",
      "Vallow had gone to the home where Vallow Daybell was living with Cox and the two children after their separation to pick up JJ. The home was in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.",
      "In police video, Tylee said that she heard Vallow and Cox arguing.",
      "\"Honestly, it feels, it feels like 2 seconds, and 40 minutes at the same time. ... I just kind of heard yelling over everything. I don't know, I kind of just do that when everything is, like, really loud, I kind of just tune what people are saying out,\" she told detectives.",
      "Cox told police that he had killed Vallow in self-defense. He was not arrested.",
      "Cox's wife, Zulema Pastenes, testified that Daybell and Vallow Daybell had convinced him that his divine mission was to protect his sister. Pastenes said that Cox told her he feared the pair would make him their \"fall guy.\" That conversation, Pastenes said, occurred a day before Cox's sudden death in December 2019. Medical examiners said he died of a pulmonary blood clot.",
      "What to know about the latest charges",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell has been charged with conspiring with Alex Cox to kill Charles Vallow. The trial is taking place in Phoenix, Arizona, where Vallow died.",
      "April Raymond\u00a0told \"48 Hours\" that Vallow Daybell, her former friend, told her\u00a0she believed Vallow was already dead and had a demon living inside him. She would later make similar comments about her children.",
      "In December 2024, a judge ruled that Vallow Daybell was mentally fit to stand trial. She will be able to wear civilian clothes and will not be shackled, but will have to wear a shock vest, AZFamily said.",
      "Complicating the trial is Vallow Daybell's decision to represent herself. Vallow Daybell said that she has studied case law during her time in prison. She also said she has experience in court that will help her represent herself.",
      "\"My intention is to say the things that I would say for myself,\" Vallow Daybell said in the jailhouse interview with Whitney.",
      "She said her attorneys in Idaho did not always say what she wanted them to and \"sometimes you just have to be able to do it for yourself.\"",
      "Vallow Daybell said she hadn't decided yet if she would testify at the trial.",
      "\"We're going to see how it goes,\" she said.",
      "The logistics of preparing for the case have been a challenge, Vallow Daybell said. At a\u00a0hearing on March 18 she said it was difficult for her to communicate with her legal team while in jail.",
      "\"Where I am at the jail, the communication is very difficult for me to get ahold of my investigator, get ahold of my paralegal. I'm 23 hours a day locked down. If I don't have Wi-Fi, I don't have a phone, if I don't have battery, I don't have a phone,\" she said.",
      "If found guilty, Vallow faces life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. She is already serving multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole after the convictions in Idaho.",
      "This trial is not the last of her legal troubles. Vallow Daybell also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder for the attempted shooting of her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux.\u00a0Boudreaux was shot at in 2019\u00a0while driving near his home but was unhurt. Prosecutors say Cox carried out the shooting but missed his target. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the charge.",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell's \"Dateline\" interview",
      "In a jailhouse interview with NBC's \"Dateline,\" which aired in March, Vallow Daybell made multiple baseless claims. She was often combative toward correspondent Keith Morrison as she claimed to be innocent of all charges.",
      "She said she \"was not there\" when JJ and Tylee were killed and was not involved in Tammy Daybell's death. She tried to blame JJ's death on Tylee, Morrison said, but investigators have said Tylee died before JJ.",
      "\"She came in and she had her own agenda,\" Morrison said of Vallow Daybell ahead of the airing of the \"Dateline\" episode. \"She wanted to be the aggressor.\"",
      "During the interview, Vallow Daybell also briefly discussed how she would serve as her own attorney in the Charles Vallow case. She called the process \"great\" but a \"difficult thing to do.\"",

      "Stocks in the U.S. look poised for another bruising day, with futures on leading indexes pointing south and following a wave of selling overseas amid mounting investor fears over the economic fallout from the\u00a0Trump administration's barrage of tariffs.",
      "Two hours before markets opened in New York, futures on the S&P 500 were down 92 points, or 1.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, which had fallen roughly 1,250 points in earlier trading on Monday, pared those losses and were down 900 points, or 2.3%, while Nasdaq Composite futures were off 2.1%.",
      "In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index tumbled 7.8%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 13.2% \u2014 its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis \u2014 and the Shanghai Composite index lost 7.3%.

      "\"Game of chicken\"",
      "Stock markets around the world sold off last week after President Trump on April 2 announced a minimum\u00a010% tariff\u00a0on all U.S. imports and\u00a0\"reciprocal\" levies\u00a0on nearly 90 countries. The global tariff took effect on Saturday, while the matching tariffs are set to hit on April 9.",
      "The scale of the tariffs has surprised investors, sending U.S. stocks into their sharpest decline in five years and wiping out trillions in investor wealth. Many economists warn that imposing broad tariffs on goods shipped into the U.S. could drive up inflation, chill spending by consumers and hurt economic growth.",
      "Retaliating against the U.S., China said Friday it will place a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. Beijing in March also started charging a 15% tax on American farm products, including chicken, pork and soy beans.",
      "\"China and the U.S. are now locked in a game of chicken, with the risk of a severe global trade war looming over financial markets,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics told investors in a note.",
      "The S&P 500 has declined nearly 14% since Mr. Trump unveiled the latest tariffs last week, while the blue-chip Dow is down 12%. The Nasdaq has decreased nearly 16% over that period, putting the tech-heavy index in a bear market \u2014 when stocks fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Highest tariffs since 1909",
      "Since re-entering the White House in January, Mr. Trump has also slapped 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, sharply raised import duties on Chinese goods, and put 25% levies on foreign cars, among other measures aimed at U.S. trading partners.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate on imported goods is now at its highest level since 1909, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that he won't retreat from his tariffs unless other nations even out their trade with the U.S.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, the president said he didn't want global markets to fall but that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "Senior Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their trade policies, saying on Sunday that more than 50 countries subject to the latest round of tariffs have requested talks.",
      "Speaking on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs are \"definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. The president needs to reset global trade.\"",
      "Despite last week's market rout, some Wall Street economists expect the Trump administration to ease tariffs on certain countries in the months ahead in return for their lowering trade barriers. That would likely help shore up stocks.",
      "\"Our assumption is that, over the next few months Trump will make 'deals' with many countries, although China may be the exception,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"Once it becomes clear that he is willing to accept relatively minor concessions in exchange for scaling back those tariffs, equities should rebound.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just over three months into 2025, the United States has recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children. The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to\u00a0more than 480 and continues to rise. Nationwide, cases have surpassed 600, with infections confirmed in 21 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",
      "\"When more than 95% of people in a community are vaccinated, most people are protected through community immunity (herd immunity),\" the CDC states.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a\u00a0noted vaccine skeptic, voiced support for the measles vaccine in early March amid the\u00a0deadly outbreak\u00a0in the Southwest, after previously downplaying the growing cases and making numerous false and misleading claims about the safety of the MMR vaccine.",
      "Kennedy said he was \"deeply concerned about the recent measles outbreak,\" in an opinion piece published by Fox News.",

    "story": [
      "Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is speaking out President Trump's sweeping tariffs, cautioning the levies could\u00a0lead to higher inflation and slow the U.S. economy. Other Wall Street leaders are also starting to express tariff-related concerns, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.",
      "While many corporate leaders have been notably silent around Mr. Trump's trade policies, Wall Street executives this week spoke critically of the Trump administration's range of tariffs, some of which went into effect over the weekend, following the loss of trillions of value in last week's stock market rout.",
      "In his annual\u00a0letter to shareholders Monday, Dimon warned that Mr. Trump's \"tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.\" Dimon's remarks come after he said in January that Americans should \"get over\" concerns about the effects of tariffs.",
      "Dimon, who heads the largest U.S. bank, added in his shareholder letter that while the economy is weakening, stock market \"prices remain relatively high.\" While Dimon did not criticize Mr. Trump directly, he noted that the tariffs would have \"short-term effects\" including anticipated higher prices on both domestic and imported goods.",
      "Such conditions could lead to what's known as stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 which describes economic periods when growth slows even as prices remain painfully high. Inflation typically eases when the economy contracts.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" Dimon said.",
      "He said potential retaliatory actions by other nations are weighing on confidence, and said unequivocally that the \"quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.\"",
      "\"Economic nuclear war\"",
      "A chorus of other high-profile Wall Street executives echoed Dimon's remarks, with some sharply criticizing the White House's recent tariff actions. Many corporate leaders have thus far been reluctant to openly criticize the Trump Administration's agenda.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said on X Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "Ackman said that the\u00a0reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on dozens of countries April 9 would be tantamount launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"",
      "As a result, \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he said.",
      "He took aim at Mr. Trump directly, saying \"The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe\" and that if he doesn't pause the tariffs from going into effect, the U.S. is headed for a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\"",
      "Tariff \"errors\"",
      "Other prominent investors that are chiming in include billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Family Office, who wrote in a\u00a0social media\u00a0post, \"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10%.\"",
      "And hedge fund manager Dan Loeb, CEO of Third Point, on X posted an American Enterprise Institute analysis of Mr. Trump's tariff formula, which he said highlighted its \"conceptual as well as practical errors.\"",

    "summary": "As the Trump administration makes cuts to federal health agencies, some Alzheimer's experts are worried about the impact on research and patients with the disease.",
    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration makes\u00a0major cuts to\u00a0federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, some Alzheimer's experts are worried about research for the brain-impairing disease being halted, which could impact treatment options and the lives of patients and their families.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association\u00a0said last week that two related programs have had staff placed on administrative leave as part of the reductions: The Healthy Brain Initiative, which aims to improve understanding around brain health, and\u00a0Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's, which focuses on risk reduction as well as increasing detection and diagnosis.",
      "These programs \"have a meaningful impact on Americans everyday,\" the organization said in a statement, adding that the BOLD program, as well as other Alzheimer's programs, were just unanimously reauthorized by Congress last year.",
      "The association's president and CEO Joanne Pike said these public health programs are critical to those dealing with Alzheimer's and dementia across the country.",
      "\"Among other things, they ensure that people living with dementia, caregivers and health providers have the information, resources and support they need,\" Pike said. \"The programs remain intact, but continuing on a path of reducing staff and resources could cause irreversible damage.\"",
      "According to the nonprofit\u00a0Alzheimer's Impact Movement, federal funding for Alzheimer's research accounts for as much as $3.8 billion each year.",
      "\"Reduced research funding means we are delaying the development and refinement of treatments that could delay or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms, reducing quality of life and increasing suffering for both patients and families,\" Jason Krellman, a clinical neuropsychologist and assistant professor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told CBS News.",
      "He says this is a crucial time for brain disease research, as drugs are being developed that show potential to treat the underlying causes of Alzheimer's rather than just slowing its symptoms.",
      "\"Funding cuts will surely reduce or even stop the progress we are now starting to make toward cures for Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. That is especially problematic because our population is aging more than ever before and these diseases will therefore become much more prevalent in the years to come,\" he said.",
      "Cuts could threaten \"the entire pipeline\"",
      "Lawrence Chernin, CEO and co-founder of Dabble Health, a company focused on cognitive health monitoring, worries funding cuts could leave potentially life-changing innovations behind. He and his team are developing an app that he hopes could give people a \"cognitive score,\" similar to health apps that give sleep scores \u2014 but further testing is needed for scientific validatation.",
      "Despite promising data from a pilot study, Chernin said traditional investors often consider tools like theirs \"too early and too risky.\"",
      "\"Government funding through NIH and SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grants represents the only viable bridge from promising research to clinical validation,\" he told CBS News, adding that his company recently applied for an SBIR grant.",
      "\"Frankly, without this funding, our company may not survive,\" he said. \"These NIH cuts don't just threaten our company; they threaten the entire pipeline of early-stage medical innovations that could transform Alzheimer's care.\"",
      "SBIR helps fund the NIH's National Institute of Aging, which makes nearly $150 million in grants to small businesses each year. According to the institute, it is the largest source of early-stage funding for aging-related research and development, including interventions for Alzheimer's disease.",
      "And while Chernin recognizes some people think there's a lot of waste in government spending, he says \"overall it achieves so much,\" pointing to breakthroughs in cancer research, for example.",
      "\"Now, cancer isn't as terrible, actually, in terms of the scope of diseases like Alzheimer's is, because there are remedies for cancer,\" he said.",
      "Hoping for continued support",
      "Some, however, like Dr. Joshua Hare, who is chairman and chief science officer at biotechnology company Longeveron, are optimistic. The company just successfully completed a Phase 2 study, published last month in Nature Medicine, for an Alzheimer's medication they've been developing.",
      "\"Clearly, we have a president who is changing things big-time in all domains of our lives. ... They want to cut funding and streamline the NIH, that's clear, but I'm not at all convinced that they are anti-health,\" he told CBS News. Hare said he thinks there will be more funding for areas consistent with the Make America Healthy Again initiative, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s platform focusing on chronic disease, food additives and other priorities.",
      "So while there will be cuts to certain areas \u2014 COVID and DEI-related initiatives are already being hit, for example \u2014 Hare said he's not so worried about Alzheimer's research being slashed.",
      "\"I can't say that for sure. I'm not in the government. I just listened to the testimony that the new director of NIH gave to Congress in his confirmation hearings, and he specifically addressed Alzheimer's research, and he specifically said that there are avenues of research for Alzheimer's that are underfunded and deserve ongoing funding.\"",

    "story": [
      "Alex Ovechkin has broken Wayne Gretzky's record for most goals in NHL history by scoring the 895th goal of his career on Sunday.",
      "The Washington Capitals' captain made history when he scored against the New York Islanders by beating fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin on a power play with 12:34 left in the second period. He took a perfect pass from longtime teammate Tom Wilson and fired an absolute laser past Sorokin with defenseman Jakob Chychrun screening. It was his first time scoring against Sorokin.",
      "He dived onto the ice to celebrate as so many Capitals fans in attendance chanted \"Ovi! Ovi!\" from the stands.",
      "Just as they did after he scored No. 894 minutes earlier, teammates mobbed the 39-year-old Russian to celebrate the accomplishment, which replaced a record that had stood for 31 years.",
      "Ovechkin then hugged team equipment and training staff on the bench and went through a handshake line with the Islanders as crew members set up for the 895 ceremony.",
      "\"Wayne, you'll always be the 'Great One' and you had a record that nobody ever thought would be broken,\" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said to open the festivities. \"But Alex, you did it. You've been amazing.\"",
      "Gretzky congratulated Ovechkin and his family for the accomplishment, adding, \"They say records are made to be broken, but I'm not sure who's going to get more goals than that.\"",
      "With Gretzky, wife Janet, Bettman and Ovechkin's wife, mother and two sons standing nearby, Ovechkin addressed the crowd and said: \"I've always said, all the time, it's a team sport. ... Fellas, thank you very much. I love you so much.\"",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin congratulated Ovechkin, as well, saying in a statement released by the Kremlin Monday that, \"This achievement has become not only your personal success, but also a real celebration for fans in Russia and abroad.\"",
      "The 39-year-old veteran had been on track to break Gretzky's long-held record and only tied him on Friday night when he scored two against the Chicago Blackhawks. He passed the record even after missing 16 games in November and December because of a broken left leg, a testament to his durability and knack for putting the puck in the back of the net for two decades.",
      "Even with this one falling to Ovechkin \u2014 which he has said he is excited about \u2014 Gretzky holds 55 NHL records, and two seem truly untouchable: 2,857 total points and 1,963 assists, the latter of which is more than anyone else has in goals and assists combined.",
      "For NHL playoff goals, which do not count toward the record, Gretzky has the most (122). Ovechkin has 72. Gretzky also had another 56 in the World Hockey Association regular season and playoffs, while Ovechkin has 57 from his time in the KHL, Russia's top league.",
      "Returning to Russia to play in front of family and friends is an option at some point for Ovechkin, who has one season left after this one on the five-year, $47.5 million contract he signed in 2021, which took him through age 40 to give him enough time to chase Gretzky's record. Instead, he got it done earlier than just about anyone could have realistically expected.",

      "In north-central Kentucky, emergency officials ordered a mandatory evacuation for Falmouth, a town of 2,000 people in a bend of the swelling Licking River, as the rising water summoned fears of damaging floods. The warnings were similar to catastrophic flooding nearly 30 years prior when the river reached a record 50 feet high, resulting in at least 10 deaths and 1,000 homes destroyed.",
      "Over in Arkansas, weather officials pleaded with the public to avoid all travel unless absolutely necessary due to the widespread flooding.",

      "There is little to no evidence to support a \"vague, uncorroborated\" allegation that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was once in the MS-13 street gang, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis wrote. And in any case, she said, an immigration judge had expressly barred the U.S. in 2019 from deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he faced likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "\"As defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador \u2014 let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere,\" Xinis wrote.",
      "She said it was \"eye-popping\" that the government had argued that it could not be forced to bring Abrego Garcia back because he is no longer in U.S. custody.",
      "\"They do indeed cling to the stunning proposition that they can forcibly remove any person \u2014 migrant and U.S. citizen alike \u2014to prisons outside the United States, and then baldly assert they have no way to effectuate return because they are no longer the 'custodian,' and the Court thus lacks jurisdiction,\" Xinis wrote. \"As a practical matter, the facts say otherwise.\"",

      "Abrego Garcia gets detained",
      "Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old Salvadoran national who has never been charged or convicted of any crime, was detained by immigration agents and deported last month.",

      "The Justice Department placed Reuveni on leave after he made the comments.",

    "story": [
      "A landmark Justice Department office created in the 1960's during the civil rights movement is marked for closure by the Trump administration, raising fears of a loss of generations of work tamping down and working to prevent unrest in the nation's major cities.",
      "An internal Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News said Trump appointees are considering closing the Community Relations Service, which was created as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The mission of the office is to be \"America's peacemaker,\" tasked with \"preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service does not investigate or prosecute crimes and has no law enforcement authority, and according to the Justice Department, its services are both confidential and free of charge to communities that accept or request them. In 2021, the agency said of its mission that it sought to help realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"inspiring dream of a vibrant, all-embracing nation unified in justice, peace, and reconciliation.\"",
      "The office has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. It was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged following the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio in 2022 after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "Former leaders of the Community Relations Service worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide.",
      "\"We would find and stop brush fires, before they became forest fires,\" said Ron Wakabayashi, a former regional director of the Community Relations Service. Wakabayashi told CBS News he fears the nation will be at greater risk of unrest, boycotts and lawsuits without the agency's Community Relations Service deployed regionally across nation.",
      "The Community Relations Service's low-profile approach means it has remained less well known even among federal government leaders, though it has been a vital asset for the Justice Department, according to some who have led the office. Community Relations Service employees have quietly intervened with church leaders, community leaders, relatives of victims of violence and city administrators to ward off unrest, lawsuits or boycotts.",
      "President John F. Kennedy conceived of the office in the early 1960s, saying the federal government should have experts who can \"identify tensions before they reach the crisis stage\" and \"work quietly to ease tensions and improve relations in any community threatened or torn with strife.\"",
      "The passage of hate crimes legislation in the wake of the killings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. in the late 1990s meant that the office's jurisdiction \"expanded to gender, sex, religion, protected classes of people,\" Wakabayashi said.",
      "He said the experienced employees of the Community Relations Service would develop relationships over the course of years in major cities, with leaders of houses of worship, police departments and activists to earn credibility and better equip themselves to mediate disputes.",
      "According to Wakabayasi, at one point the office employed 600 professional staff, including mediators and community outreach experts, in regional offices in Philadelphia, Dallas, Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Boston.",
      "The Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News indicates some of the current Community Relations Service staff would be reassigned to federal prosecutors' offices nationwide. Former staffers say that type of reorganization could cripple the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife in U.S. cities because community activists might be less willing to work with so-called peacemakers who may be perceived to be aligned with prosecutors' offices.",
      "Bert Brandenburg, who previously worked in the Community Relations Service, and other former Justice Department officials questioned plans to close the office: \"During eras of soaring racial tension \u2013 wouldn't it make sense to have people in communities while they arise ... so they don't lead to boycotts, litigation or unrest?\"",
      "\"Violence prevention works best when communities see conciliators as honest brokers they can open up with as part of working through conflicts, which is distinct from the critical work of prosecutors holding wrongdoers accountable,\" Brandenburg told CBS News.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a speech in July 2024, Justin Lock, a former director of the Community Relations Service, lauded the office's accomplishments. Lock said the office had been \"at the intersection of some of the most critical moments in our nation's journey toward justice.\"",
      "\"In 2020, when Americans marched in solidarity with the people of Brunswick, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, following the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, CRS engaged with communities as an impartial, confidential facilitator, helping stakeholders identify and implement solutions that help communities to heal and move forward,\" Locke said.",
      "Rep Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, in a statement to CBS News praised the office's work in defusing tensions between minority communities and the government and expressed concern about reports that it would be cut. \"At a time when hate crimes and community tensions are on the rise, reducing support for this essential office would be a grave mistake,\" he said. \"I urge the DOJ to reaffirm its commitment to building trust and bringing greater safety to all our communities.\"",

      "Azzi Fudd led the Huskies with 24 points while Sarah Strong added 24 points and 15 rebounds. Paige Bueckers had 17 points in her final game at UConn (37-3).",
      "\"Well, it's amazing to have three players, three people like that on the same team,\" Auriemma said. \"And Sarah, you would think Sarah was graduating the way she plays, right? All three of them complement each other so well. They all have such unique skill sets.\"",
      "Bueckers capped her stellar career with the Huskies' first championship since 2016 \u2014   the longest for Auriemma since the team won its first championship in 1995 led by Rebecca Lobo.",
      "Since then the Huskies have had dominant championship runs, including in the early 2000s led by Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi, 2009-10 with Maya Moore and finally the four straight from 2013-16 with Breanna Stewart. All were in attendance in Florida on Sunday to see the Huskies' latest title.",
      "\"You just never know if you'll ever be back in this situation again,\" Auriemma said. \"And there were so many times when I think we all questioned, 'Have we been here too long? Has it been time?' And we kept hanging in there and hanging in there and that's because these players make me want to hang in there every day.\"",
      "Finally healthy, the expected No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft on April 14, Bueckers delivered for the Huskies throughout their championship season.",
      "It was the only thing missing from her incredible UConn career that was slowed by injuries. She was the first freshman to win AP Player of the Year before missing a lot of her sophomore season with a tibial plateau fracture and meniscus tear. She then tore an ACL before the next season.",
      "UConn closed the first half up 10 points and then put the game away in the third quarter behind Fudd, Strong and Bueckers. The trio combined for 23 of the team's 26 points in the quarter. UConn was up 50-39 with 3:21 left in the period before closing with a 12-3 run to put the game away.",
      "Fudd and Strong got it started with back-to-back 3s, and the rout was on. Auriemma subbed Bueckers, Fudd and Strong out with 1:32 left. Bueckers and Auriemma had a long hug on the sideline, having finally gotten that championship that he so wanted for her.",
      "Dawn Staley's team was trying for a third title in four years and fourth overall. It would have tied her with Kim Mulkey for third-most behind Auriemma and former Tennessee Hall of Fame coach Pat Summitt, who had eight.",
      "\"Our kids gave it all they had. When you can understand why you lost and when you've been on the other side of that three times, you understand it,\" Staley said. \"You can swallow it. We lost to a very good basketball team.\"",
      "UConn had reached the title game only once during its drought since 2016. The Huskies had been eliminated by heartbreaking last-second losses in the Final Four on buzzer-beaters. The Huskies' last title game appearance came in 2022 when Staley's team beat UConn to start the Gamecocks' current run of success, a game that ended Auriemma's perfect record in title games.",
      "There seemed to be no nerves early for either team as the game got off to a fast start. The teams traded baskets for the first few minutes before the defenses started to clamp down. The Huskies led 19-14 after one quarter and then extended the advantage to 36-26 at the half. Fudd had 13 points and Strong added eight points and 11 rebounds.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president claims all is going according to plan and hit the links this weekend, though he was tracking headlines about China's decision to fire back with tariffs on all American products.",
      "We will get the latest from President Trump's point man on tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and check in with the number two Senate Republican, John Barrasso. He's tasked with carrying out the other part of the president's economic agenda, sweeping tax cuts.",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It is shaping up to be another turbulent week, as President Trump's trade war with the world escalates. The global sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements wiped out more than $6 trillion of wealth from the U.S. stock market in just two days.",
      "In a social media post yesterday, the president urged the country to hang tough, all this as tens of thousands of people took to the streets yesterday from Washington, D.C., to Minnesota and Columbus, Ohio, protesting many of Trump's policies, Elon Musk and tariffs.",

      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see about 60 percent of Americans have money in the stock market, which mean that retirees could be just as concerned as hedge fund managers this morning.",
      "Did you expect this level of shock in the financial markets?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, you have got to realize this is a national security issue. I mean, we don't make medicine in this country anymore. We don't make ships. We don't have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right?",
      "All our semiconductors are made overseas, so every button we press when we try to start our car or even use our microwave, these are all semiconductors. They're all made elsewhere. We have got to start to protect ourselves, and we have got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and the rest of the world has a surplus with us. They're earning our money. They're taking our money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump has seen this, and he's going to stop it.",
      "So it is going to be a big change. Of course, it's going to be a big change, but the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years. Donald Trump has seen it. He's spoken about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. And\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's just not going to take it anymore, and that's his model.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that was abundantly clear during the presidential campaign how much the president truly believes in tariffs and putting it at the center of his economic policy.",
      "But you saw absolute panic in the global markets. Did you expect that, or were you surprised?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike.",
      "The idea that all the countries of the world can run trade surpluses with America and buy our things with us, remember, $1.2 trillion \u2013 in 1980, we were a net investor, meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's a different world. This is a different market.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And now \u2013 and now they own $18 trillion of us net. So that means the rest of the world \u2013 every year, when we run a $1.2 trillion deficit, the rest of the world buys $1.2 trillion of America.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 we can't fly a plane, we can't build our own planes, we don't have our own semiconductors. This is what the president is here to fix for America. It's in his hands and he wants to fix America. This is his chance to fix America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we need him to fix it for our children and our grandchildren.",

      "For a CEO to choose to invest\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well said. Well said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But for a CEO to make those decisions, you know this, they need certainty. They need to know if it costs them more to stay overseas or if it costs them more to move here.",
      "So can you give them clarity, so that they don't just cut jobs because they're dealing with the cost of these tariffs? Can you tell them how long they're staying in place?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Absolutely.",
      "The United States of America is going to protect the people who invest in America. Trillions and trillions of dollars, you heard the president speak about it, are coming to invest in America. This is the economy of the world.",
      "We are the consumer of the world, and companies need to build it here and we will protect them for building it here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So does\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We will help the American workers. Yes, American workers are more expensive, but they're better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're going to protect all the factories that come to America. And that's what's coming here. So, the president is on it. He's going to protect them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, remember, this is a national security issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he needs to address our budget deficit.",
      "That \u2013 you know, the laws of America are the laws of America. He would like it to be that we need to protect the companies that invest here and we are going to protect the companies that invest here. That is the policy of the United States of America. That's why trillions of dollars are coming here.",
      "The ripoff of the United States of America is over.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All these companies are going to come and invest here. That's what they're doing. That's why they have committed trillions of dollars. They know this is the economy. This is the place to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Mr. Secretary, though \u2013 Mr. Secretary, the campaign is over. You won.",
      "So I'm asking what the plan is. So, the Treasury secretary said on another network: \"We're going to hold the course. It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.\"",
      "That makes it sound like the tariffs are staying in place at least for days or weeks. Is that correct? Or is the president considering postponing implementation to negotiate?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious.",
      "The president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. We are paying away our future and our lives. The countries of the world are ripping us off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And it's got to end. The president has made it crystal, crystal clear. This is the policy.",
      "We are going to protect \u2013 the factories that come build in America, we are going to protect them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They're going to be successful. That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the Earth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All of these companies are going to come and build here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when three of the president's other economic advisers who are on other networks today say that 50 different countries have been calling the White House to try to talk about the tariffs, what does that mean?",
      "Because that makes it sound like there is a negotiation, which is different from saying the tariffs are permanent.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, what it shows is that all these countries know that they have been ripping us off and the day has come for that to end.",
      "Now, the problem is, it's not just tariffs. Like, I will give you an example. Like, Vietnam said, they'd like to be zero-zero. Remember, Vietnam sends us $120 billion worth of goods every year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, cheap manufacturing.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we send them about $12 billion. Wait. We send them $12 billion.",
      "So it's not the tariffs. It has nothing to do with tariffs. If they went to zero-zero, they would go to $200 billion with us. We need to stop the ripoff. And zero-zero is the way to make them more of a ripoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but we don't have zero-zero, sir.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't have zero-zero, actually, because when we saw the president stand in the Rose Garden holding up that chart that you helped make, that wasn't actually tariffs.",
      "That was actually confusing to investors, because it was some kind of other formula. And the countries themselves seemed kind of random. Like, why are the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face 10 percent tariffs?",
      "Did you use A.I. to generate this?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No. No, the idea \u2013 look, the idea is that there are many countries left off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are they on the list?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Because the idea \u2013 what happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.",
      "Any country \u2013 like, we had tariffs \u2013 the president put tariffs on China, right, in 2018. And then what China started doing is, they started going through other countries to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They just built through other countries through America.",
      "And so the president knows that. He's tired of it. And he's going to fix that. So, basically, he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: So he ended those loopholes, these ridiculous loopholes.",
      "And now what he's trying to say is, I'm going to fix the trade deficit of the United States of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: It's a national security issue. We need to make medicine. We need to make semiconductors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need to make ships. We need to have steel and aluminum. Come on, we need the greatness of America to actually be built in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's tired of getting ripped off by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but, just to be clear, April 9, the so-called retaliatory tariffs, the reciprocal tariffs, I should say, are those coming or are they open to negotiation?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: He announced it and he wasn't kidding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Is the administration considering any kind of offset, any kind of subsidy? You mentioned, the first administration, there was some bailout to farmers to help them deal with the pain from Chinese retaliation.",
      "Are you looking at that now?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I'm \u2013 not that I have \u2013 I have not participated in any meetings with respect to that. The country is focused on \u2013 you realize, trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP. The factories being built in America are huge GDP.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That takes years.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And that is going to matter to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have said that robots are going to fill those jobs. So, those aren't union worker jobs.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, it's really automated jobs. It's automated factories, automated factories. But the key is, who's going to build the factories, who's going to operate the factories, who's going to make them work, great American workers.",
      "You know, we are going to replace\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said robots on other networks. You said that to FOX.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 the armies of millions of people \u2013 well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.",
      "It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They're going to be mechanics. There's going to be HVAC specialists. There's going to be electricians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tradecraft of America, our high school- educated Americans, the core to our work force is going to have the greatest resurgence\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned that \u2013 are you concerned, in the time it will take for a company to move to America, that it will benefit China in the \u2013 in the immediate term, that other markets will look to other suppliers, instead of dealing with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: That is ridiculous. The problem is, everyone in the world sells to us.",
      "Our economy is the consumer of the world. We are the only one with a trade deficit. The rest of the world has a trade surplus. Why does Europe have a trade surplus? Is there something about Europe that's special? Seriously, are they a different world than we are? Why are they selling $200 billion a year\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 more to us?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's doing it for America, and he's doing it for your children and mine and our grandchildren. This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump's been talking about this his whole life. This is Donald Trump's agenda.",

      "Good to have you here in person, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-Wyoming): Thanks. Great to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about what the secretary just laid out. He did not describe this as leverage to get to a deal, said this \u2013 take him literally \u2013 the tariffs are here to stay.",
      "We have already seen some conservative groups, like the New Civil Liberties Alliance, file suit, saying that these are not on solid constitutional and legal ground. Do you think the president's on solid legal ground?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well I think he is.",
      "But, look, this is about a monumental change in the direction of our government. We are \u2013 and I'm talking about a change in terms of the size, as well as the priorities. And this is a 180-degree change from what we had for the last four years with big government, big spending, big taxes.",
      "And we have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people. That's why we passed what we did just yesterday in the Senate, because we want people to have more \u2013 better jobs, more opportunities, and more money in their own pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: So, in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool.",
      "And I think we have to go after China. They have been abusing us for years. And I believe the president is on const \u2013 firm constitutional grounds.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I hear you talk about sort of the one-two punch on the economic plan for the president, tax cuts being one of them, isn't there some coordination on sequencing here?",
      "Because wouldn't you go ahead and remove the regulations and go ahead with the tax cuts before you go to war with the entire world over trade?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the president has been talking about these tariffs every speech that I was with him during the campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was indeed.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: There is no surprise here. He's also talked about making sure we don't have this $4 trillion tax increase that the Democrats want to have.",
      "We have a lot of work to do to reverse the damage that's been done over the last four years with the Democrats that led to the highest inflation in 40 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: So the president wants to get a lot of things done. And I want to get a lot of things done in Congress as part of this comprehensive economic plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you saw the Fed chair also say that we may be facing inflation now in part because of these tariffs.",
      "You know some in the Senate are very concerned about having more control and say over trade. Maria Cantwell, a senator who will be with us later in this program, partnered with Chuck Grassley, one of the most powerful Republicans, with this bill to try to claw back control. They want 48 hours' notice on tariffs, suggest they didn't get much this time.",
      "And they want them to expire after 60 days unless Congress approves of them. Will leadership let this effort advance?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Senator Grassley is chairman of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "But let me just say, the president is on firm legal grounds here. Over the last 90 years, Congress has given the presidents, different presidents, more and more authority to deal with national security issues with regard to tariffs, to use tariffs with regard to unfair trade. So the president has the authority.",
      "I think this is similar to the bill that Chuck Grassley introduced about five years ago. They had debate then. Many of the cosponsors are the same. This will get a thorough hearing, and then we will see where it goes from there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that Congress needs to have more of a say on trade issues?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the Constitution says Congress has the entire say, but over the last 90 years\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the way it's playing out now.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: \u2026 more and more authority has been given to the president to be able to be more nimble to react in terms of national security, in terms of unfair trade.",
      "And I think President Trump is doing what he has every right to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you're open to making that more clear on what the limits should be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there will be a discussion in the Senate. We will see which way the discussion goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the work that got done over the weekend. You did take the step forward in advancing the president's tax agenda and raising the debt ceiling with this budget framework.",
      "You know what a fight you're going to have with fellow Republicans over in the House. Jodey Arrington, the Budget chairman, called it unserious and disappointing, accused your Republican colleagues of creating $6 trillion in new costs and a mere $4 billion in enforceable cuts.",
      "Is this headed for failure in the House?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No.",
      "We are united in what we believe in terms of making sure we have a nation that is safe and prosperous. The speaker of the House and the leadership of the House came out and endorsed what we have done and said, hey, we ought to move ahead and take that next step.",
      "So what we have seen\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Five Republicans have come out against it. And it's a pretty narrow margin.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: But they all agree with what we want to do, which is unleash American energy to get energy prices down for people. They all agree that we ought to make sure that we don't have these $4 trillion tax increases.",
      "They all want to make sure we secure the border. So all of the parts of what we have here are part of what we want to have done. Now, I'm the whip. My job is to count votes. We need 51 in the Senate. They need 218 in the House. We have to iron out the differences. We're committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know they're short about five votes right now. So it sounds like, if you have to take another bite at the apple \u2013 the reason that this matters so much is procedurally you have got to clear the way for all those big things you want to get done, like the tax cuts, by September.",
      "Speaker Johnson said he wants it done by May. Senator Lankford said it has to get done by August. Does all the instability speed things up for you?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I'm not worried about deadlines. I want to get \u2013 I have an urgency to get it done as soon as we can, so we can get these policies in place and also to provide the certainty to people who are worried, are my taxes going to go up at the end of the year?",
      "They want to have the confidence that they're not going to go up. I think the more certainty we can provide to the folks around the country, that they will see that we have \u2013 on the right path for a strong, healthy, growing economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And we want to get the country back on track. And the sooner we can get this passed, the sooner we can reverse the damage that the Democrats have done over the last four years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have got to get Speaker Johnson to wrangle those votes, though\u2026",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which you admit they're not there right now?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, we're going to put the language together. We do have to iron out the differences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And I'm committed to getting it done.",

People are concerned about this \u2013 40(k) \u2013 401(k)s, retirement plans, they do the best when we have confidence in the future, when we have a strong, healthy, growing economy.",
      "And that's why we have a comprehensive economic plan to deal with all of this, to making sure the taxes don't go up, to cut so much of this reckless Washington spending. People saw the list of all the terrible things we've been spending money on in the last four years, and people were offended and angry at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We're \u2013 what we're doing is also cutting a lot of this reckless Washington spending, gives people more money in their own pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know markets move a lot faster than Congress does, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: They do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got your work cut out for you.",
      "But we appreciate you laying out the details for us.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an interview or an episode of Face the Nation, you can watch it on our YouTube page or on FacetheNation.com.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell and Republican Congressman Don Bacon. They have some ideas about how Congress can rein in the president's power to issue tariffs.",
      "And we will discuss that on the other side of this break. So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Washington state senator, Maria Cantwell.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL (D-WA): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, you heard the - the Senate whip talk about your effort to claw back some control over trade. He said it will have a thorough hearing and we'll see where it goes from there. Do you have any indication of momentum among some of your Republican colleagues?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, the first day of interdiction we signed up seven Republicans. So, usually you don't get first introduction and get so many people on board. But I think it shows the anxiety that people have. I'm sure if they listen to their constituents, consumer challenges are already starting to surface. And certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people.",
      "So, I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them. Today consumer groups are announcing and retailers the fact that they want Congress to take this action up. And so, I think we're hearing from a big segment of the economy, the consumer spending is a big part of GDP, and they're worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got, what six Republicans at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Seven.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Seven. And now you're saying retailers. Like, you have CEOs who are onboard or industry groups?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Industry groups, like the Retailers Association, the outdoor industry, the Consumer Electronics Group, Main Street Alliance, organizations who know their bread and butter comes from consumer spending, which is a big part of our economy. And so, they are very anxious about a plan.",
      "Listen, I listened to your segment. I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life. And the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the letters in Greek - all the stuff that makes no sense. That's what people are - consumers are saying. How is this helping me, in a time of inflation? You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods.",
      "And so, I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Canada and China are among your state's largest export markets. Both of - have already announced retaliatory tariffs. I know you've said previously that the first Trump administration and the more limited tariffs still to this day have an impact on your state. So, how much wiggle room do we have with time here? Because you heard the Commerce secretary say that basically these aren't a negotiating ploy, that they are staying in place. That's what he says.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how long before damage?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're - we have seen damage from the first Trump tariffs on things like apples, and markets closed. And what you do is you end up then losing farm family economies. You don't necessarily lose farmland. Some big corporation might buy it. But you lose family farms. So, our objective should be to help farmers open up doors to these overseas markets.",
      "The United States' goal here should be to make great manufactured products and grow great agriculture products and then get those markets opened up. But what the president is doing is instead of building those alliances, he basically is getting into a trade war that is having unbelievable impact, when his last tariffs on India -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: We reopened with the apple market and we went to India and said, let's - let's get rid of this. And we were successful. And that's the kind of action we would have - we want to see today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state is one of the top five unionized states in the country. You have the world's largest plane manufacturer, Boeing, in Washington. So, I wonder if those union workers are as supportive of the tariffs as the auto industry workers have been. They are not against them, even though some are Democrats. In fact, they think some of them, including on this program, like Shawn Fain, have been very supportive.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're seeing - you could get the letter from the Machinist International. They don't support the president on this. And that is because they understand how much the United States and Canada have become an integrated supply chain. That helped us lower the cost of U.S. manufacturing for cars and for airplanes. And lowering that cost means that we're even more competitive.",
      "So, they don't like the uncertainty. And what they would like to see instead is the continuation of investment from the last administration. So, when you think of chips and science, and you think of the Inflation Reduction Act that made investments in next generation technology, the sectors that have a lot of employees want to win on innovation. They know that investment in innovation will help us outpace our competition, not a tariff that makes the product more expensive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Boeing's CEO testified, 80 percent of the airplanes they deliver are to markets outside the U.S., 80 percent of the content of those airplanes are manufactured here. They have a vested interest in clearing the decks for themselves here. What are they telling you about their conversations with the administration?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, everybody's concerned that the administration might retaliate against them. That, you know, that if they're not front and center in this - in this debate, but they're clear that they are being heard. I think people are saying that their strategy is - there's a demand for 40,000 airplanes and we could increase 1,000 more planes being sold, it would have a huge impact on the trade deficit.",
      "So, they are trying so say, Mr. President, don't cut the innovation and investment. Don't make semiconductors more expensive. Don't make the parts more expensive. Make it cheaper. And the United States bet on the American worker, and they will do the rest when it comes to the innovation that's required for America to build the best products.",
      "So, I think the president's math is wrong. I think he doesn't know the calculus is going to be so devastating to American consumers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CANTWELL: And that's why those groups are joining us today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cantwell, thank you for your time today.",
      "CANTWELL: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Nebraska Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who joins us this morning from Omaha.",
      "Congressman, I have a lot to get to with you on a number of topics here. But just to - to pick up on the tariffs that we've been speaking about. I know you are introducing companion legislation to what Senator Cantwell just laid out for us. But as I understand it, in the House, Republican leaders have already restricted the ability to rein in changes to the Mexico, Canada and China tariffs. They've tucked language into the continuing resolution.",
      "Does that get in your way when you are trying to now claw back some congressional control of tariffs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-NE): Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.",
      "And I enjoyed listening to Senator Cantwell. I - I support the legislation that Senator Grassley, Senator Cantwell, we have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate. And I have some beginning support in the House side which will unveil tomorrow. It will be harder to pass this in the House no doubt. I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate it will put pressure on the House to look at this. And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.",
      "So, it will not pass tomorrow -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Or maybe in the next couple weeks. But this will be in the queue that we can use. And it's time that Congress restores its authorities here. And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes. And we gave some of that power to executive branch. And I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I hear you saying you have some momentum. Respectfully, sir, the president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to them. Did Republicans just not take him seriously?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, there's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. It's a good question. You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republicans supported tariffs in the 1800s. And up and through, what, 1930, when we passed the Smoot-Hartley Act that created one of the worst - well, the worst depressions we ever had, we learned from that, that tariffs and protectionism does not work and that free trade, in the end, as long as it's fair, we want fair trade. And I support the president wanting to get fairness. Some of these countries do treat us wrong. But fair trade should be the goal.",
      "And you're right, the president talked about those. He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. But here's my take on it, and I've - I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. People voted for President Trump because of the border. And he has really delivered there. They voted for him, too, because inflation surpassed wage increases. They've - they were poorer today than they were four years ago. And I really think people voted for President Trump because of that, the border, and maybe crime if they - crime in the big cities.",
      "I don't think, in the end, I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision-making when it came to last November.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, I just - I know we certainly covered them on this program. And it is surprising to me, or perhaps it shouldn't be, that the business community is so silent right now. As Senator Cantwell said, she said they're afraid.",
      "But there is a conservative group, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, that filed suit to challenge these tariffs in court. Do you think it is the courts where this ultimately gets settled?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think ultimately it's in Congress once we see enough of this, but maybe the courts as well.",
      "The Constitution makes it very clear, Congress has control of taxes. And by the way - and let's be candid, tariffs are a tax. But they also mention tariffs in the Constitution. And we gave the president emergency powers. So, the courts will have to decide is what - what just happened, is this emergency powers or is this a total change in tariff policy. And I think it's really the latter. This is where Congress has to step in and say, do we really want to create this new policy on tariffs? And if it is, it should come from the Congress and not the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your work on the Armed Services Committee. President Trump has fired the top two officials at the head of the very powerful National Security Agency. It's one of the most powerful intelligence agencies we have. It vacuums up information around the world through wiretapping, signals intercepts and they work with the military, with Cyber Command.",
      "Have you received any explanation to Congress as to why General Haugh, the four-star general unanimously confirmed to the job, was suddenly dismissed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Margaret, I have not. But let me just comment on this. General Haugh is the absolute best leader in the U.S. military to lead Cyber Command and National Security Agency. He commanded both because half of Cyber Command relies on NSA to be effective in cyber operations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: So, you have to have this team. And he was in charge of both. He served 34 years in the military, and his entire career was working signals intelligence or cyber operations. Frankly, he is the best that we had. And they also fired the number two person at the National Security Agency without an explanation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I will tell you, this puts us back. It hurts us. And I will tell you, Russia and China today are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified. Guys that we spent three and a half decades preparing to have this role, and he's gone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And it's - it's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without explanation. And it hurt us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and our reporting, as a network, is that it came as a decision following an Oval Office meeting with a right-wing activist named Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about 9/11, said anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant things, racist things.",
      "It also happened as at least six other National Security Council officials at the White House were dismissed on the advice of Laura Loomer.",
      "I'm wondering, again respectfully, sir, Republicans are in control and you have oversight. Are there going to be hearings on this? Are there other Republicans who are concerned and going to do something about it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I'm sure there will be some oversight. I'm a - I'm the chairman of the Cyber Subcommittee, and so I guarantee you that we will have various military leaders, we'll have the secretary of defense speak to us, and he will be asked about this. And I will -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he even know?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I don't know that he knew, but we'll find out when we ask him. We'll ask him. He'll say that this is the president's right. And the president does have constitutional right to do this. But it doesn't make it appropriate or - OK, he may have the constitutional authority to do it, but it doesn't make it right.",
      "And, in the end, I'm going to make it clear, we just removed the most qualified military leader that we had to run Cyber Command and NSA. And we will ask about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Now, we have oversight. That doesn't mean we can - the president does have the constitutional authority to do this. But we have a - we have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And I have a responsibility to make clear this was wrong. It hurt us. It hurt our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, do you think it is so that the president can split up those two commands and put someone of his own choosing, a political ally, at the top of the NSA?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: You know, it's possible. I know that's out there. But I would say that's a mistake. NSA is very important to Cyber Command. You can't do Cyber Command without the inputs from the National Security Agency, the SECNET (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: If you separate them and put them under two different commands, then you're going to create a dysfunctional partnership and it will hurt our cyber operations against China and Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "OK. Congressman, we'd love to have you back for another conversation about cyber one time.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday we spoke with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and began our conversation by asking about the potential impact of the Trump administration's sweeping global tariffs on the security alliance.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "MARK RUTTE, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: There are tensions between the allies because of these - this tariffs question. But this is not concerning the alliance as a whole because there will be potentially impact on - on the economies, but not to an extent that it will impact our collective defense. That's my firm conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The next summit is now going to be held in June. And leaders there expected to hike the military budget spending goal from 2 percent to 3 percent. The Trump administration wants it all the way up to spending about 5 percent on a country's own defense.",
      "How do you convince members to spend more, to counter the threat from Russia, at a time when the U.S. is going closer to it and the U.S. is putting economic pressure on Europe?",
      "MARK RUTTE: What Trump has done since he came into office is break the deadlock when it comes to this terrible war in Ukraine because we've got to stop the killing. We have got to stop the fighting. And I commend him for that.",
      "And then when it comes to defense spending, last couple of months, here in the European side of NATO, it is staggering, the amount of billions coming in. We have to continue doing this because, as I said in December, if he would stick to the old 2 percent, we cannot defend ourselves here in three to five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at the same time that President Trump is calling for a peace deal in Ukraine, there is this parallel, separate effort to repair America's relationship with Russia. Doesn't the U.S. getting closer to Russia undercut your efforts to counter Russia?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Of course, I am - I am not in the room when all these talks take place. But what I am seeing from a - from distance and hearing from my American colleagues and all - including the president, whom I visited a couple weeks ago in a very successful meeting we had in the Oval Office and - and - and during lunch. There is this effort to bring this war to an end. The goal clearly is in the court of the Russians. They are not moving fast enough, is my impression, including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors. That - that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end. The Ukrainians are - are really close to the American position. And - and - and we have seen - we have to see how far the Americans can get this.",
      "But I am completely supporting that effort because this war of protection - - protection, it was unsustainable in the long term. So many people dying. So much of the Ukrainian infrastructure being damaged. Cities being destroyed. It's got to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: General Cavoli, who you know well as the supreme allied commander of NATO, the U.S. general, is here in Washington testifying this week. He said, \"Russia intends to diminish U.S. leadership and influence.\" What is happening to NATO members here? And - and is Russia succeeding in this destabilization campaign?",
      "MARK RUTTE: What we are seeing in Europe, but also in the U.S., but - but let me speak for the European side of NATO, is that the Russians, through cyberattacks, assassination attempts, jamming commercial airplanes in the Baltic area, cyberattacks on the national health service in the United Kingdom, cutting critical (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure between the Baltic countries and Finland, and in other parts of the Baltic - in the Baltic Sea. They are - they are conducting this campaign.",
      "The good news is that as NATO, as collective, we are much, much better, not only at assessing what is happening, but also making sure that we prevent the next steps in this campaign from happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that destabilization campaign has not halted or paused as these attempts to broker peace have been underway?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Well, I mean, this whole destabilization campaign is going on for years now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARK RUTTE: And I have no day to day assessment. But the reports we are getting is that Russia is still very active. We are still worried about, for example, (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure. But things do (INAUDIBLE). And in his role as supreme allied commander, we have in - in less than ten days brought together a big endeavor by European NATO allies in the - in the Baltic Sea to really make it very difficult for the Russians to continue doing this.",
      "And again they - they hate us for this. And - and I love that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are roughly about 90,000 or more U.S. troops stationed in Europe right now. Secretary Hegseth said Europe should not assume that presence is going to last forever. I know you say that the U.S. is committed to NATO, but do you have any sense of how fast or significant this kind of drawdown that's being mentioned by Hegseth could be? And is there NATO backup plan?",
      "MARK RUTTE: There are no concrete plans for the drawdown, but we know, and Pete Hegseth was very clear on this, is that this U.S. administration, but, by the way, this is U.S. policy since 2010, to pivot more towards Asia, towards the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MARK RUTTE: And agreement we have is that we will do whatever is necessary, and in surprises way. I completely acknowledge the fact that U.S. has, the United States, has more theaters to attend to, not only the Euro-Atlantic, but also the Indo-Pacific.",
      "And by the way, also thanks to President Trump and his position on this, as NATO we will be more and more active in the Indo-Pacific, with our partners. I will visit Japan next week to have my meetings there with the senior leadership to see how we can intensify that strong relationship we already have with the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised concern that China is building towards 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Is that a direct threat to NATO?",
      "MARK RUTTE: It is. It is a direct threat to the stability of the whole world, including NATO territory, absolutely. They have now more NATO ships sailing than the United States. We have a problem. The United States, part of NATO, Canadian part of NATO, European part of the NATO, that we are not producing enough defense industrial product. We are producing, in - in a full year in ammunition what Russia is producing in three months, that's totally crazy. And that's why the president and I discussed and the other senior leaders in the U.S. and I discussed also with European allies that we have not only to ramp up spending, but also the defense industrial production, that includes cutting the red tape, both in the U.S. and here in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just to quickly clarify that - China's nuclear arsenal is a direct threat to NATO?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Well, it's there not to be used against China. But I would say, amore generally, let's not be naive about China. The build up of their armed forces is taking place at a pace which is incredible. And when we talk about Ukraine and bringing Ukraine to a durable end and a peace, a durable peace in the end, let's not forget that Russia is working with North Korea and China and Iran, and that in the end it is an audience of one watching what comes out of this. And that is the first secretary of the communist party of China, Xi Jinping, and he will access when there is a deal on Ukraine, who comes out on top. Is it the west or is it Russia? And if it is Russia, he would get his thoughts going about his territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific. So, there are big risks involved. And that's why we have to bring Ukraine to a peace which is lasting and that Putin will never try this again.",

    "story": [
      "The funeral of 14-year-old Palestinian-American Amir Mohammed Rabee was held Monday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, one day after the dual national from New Jersey was shot and killed there. Two other teenage boys, one whose family told CBS News he is also a U.S. citizen, were shot but survived.",
      "Rabee's father told CBS News on Monday that his son's siblings live in the U.S., but that Amir and his parents were living in Turmus Ayya, in the central West Bank, where the teenager was attending school.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that IDF soldiers had \"identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving. The soldiers opened fire towards the terrorists who were endangering civilians, eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists.\"",
      "Along with its statement, the IDF released a 10-second video clip that appears to show three people throwing items. The people are not identifiable in the grainy video.",
      "Rabee's father said his son cannot be identified in the video, and he believes the three teenage boys were shot while throwing stones at an almond tree.",
      "\"The video they [IDF] published is not right, and no one can prove my son was there,\" Rabee's father told journalists on Monday. \"Unfortunately, the U.S. embassy believed the Israeli narrative based on unclear video, but the U.S. embassy turns a blind eye on videos filmed by people and journalists of\u00a0settler violence\u00a0\u2014 killing, burning and stealing, guarded by the IDF.\"",
      "CBS News asked the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem about the incident and Rabee's father's claim that American officials had accepted the Israeli military's explanation of the shooting; the embassy said it had referred the query to the U.S. State Department. A State Department spokesperson offered condolences to the family and said the U.S. was aware of the IDF's statement, but said out of respect for the family's privacy would have no other comment at this time.",
      "Rabee's father said it appeared his son had been shot with two different guns, and that two bullets had entered his heart, two had struck his head, two had hit his shoulders, and then five others had hit his body.",
      "\"It was a field execution,\" Rabee's father said.",
      "Asad Ayub Ahed, the other 14-year-old U.S. national who was shot alongside Rabee and al-Rahman, was still in a hospital in serious condition on Monday.",
      "The incident came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu traveled to Washington with plans to meet at the White House on Monday with President Trump.",
      "\"We have to\u2026 send a message for President Trump to at least stop this situation,\" Rabee's father told CBS News. \"Stop sending weapons to kill.\"",
      "Another American, U.S.-Turkish dual national\u00a0Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, was killed\u00a0in the West Bank in September. Witnesses, her family, and the group Eygi had joined at a protest in the occupied Palestinian territory\u00a0said\u00a0she was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper as she stood under a tree in the West Bank city of Nablus.

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S. will apply an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee on American products.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social app, Mr. Trump said that \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"",
      "He added, \"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax applied to all products shipped to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the\u00a0new taxes\u00a0are needed to erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to members of the European Union.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.",
      "Last year, the U.S. imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China, ranging from Apple iPhones to clothing, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Excluding the threat of an added 50% levy on Chinese imports, American consumers could face higher costs of about $3,789 per year due to the previously announced tariffs, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Consumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods. Because of those dynamics, many economists say inflation is likely to reignite this year.",
      "Wall Street has been spooked by Mr. Trump's growing trade war, with economists warning that the conflict could slam economic growth and even potentially trigger a recession.",
      "In his social media post threatening to add new tariffs to China, Mr. Trump added that he plans to start negotiations with other nations \"immediately.\"",
      "In a separate Truth Social post on Monday, Mr. Trump also said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to start trade negotiations. He complained, \"they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade\" and \"they don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs.\"",
      "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, saying they would have to make structural changes to their tax and regulatory codes.",
      "\"Let's take Vietnam,\" he said on CNBC. \"When they come to us and say, 'We'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.\"",

      "Investors have panned President Trump's tariffs, saying they are likely to hit U.S. economic growth and drive up inflation. Goldman Sachs economists cited the barrage of levies on Monday in raising the odds of a recession to 45%.",
      "\"The combination of larger tariffs, greater policy uncertainty, declining business and consumer confidence, and messaging from the administration indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of its policies increase downside risk,\" Goldman analysts said in a report.",
      "Stocks plummeted last week after Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% global duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries. The new trade measures sent markets into a tailspin, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq recording their biggest two-day drop since March 2020.",
      "Overseas stock markets also suffered steep losses Monday, continuing their skid from last week. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 13.2% \u2014 its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, while Taiwan's Taiex fell 9.7%, its heaviest loss on record.

The global tariff took effect on Saturday, while the matching tariffs are set to hit on April 9.",
      "The scale of the tariffs has surprised investors, sending U.S. stocks into their sharpest decline in five years and wiping out trillions in investor wealth. Many economists warn that imposing broad tariffs on goods shipped into the U.S. could drive up inflation, chill spending by consumers and hurt economic growth.",
      "Retaliating against the U.S., China said Friday it will place a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. Beijing in March also started charging a 15% tax on American farm products, including chicken, pork and soy beans.",

The Nasdaq has decreased nearly 16% over that period, putting the tech-heavy index in a bear market \u2014 when stocks fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Highest tariffs since 1909",
      "Since re-entering the White House in January, Mr. Trump has also slapped 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, sharply raised import duties on Chinese goods, and put 25% levies on foreign cars, among other measures aimed at U.S. trading partners.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate on imported goods is now at its highest level since 1909, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that he won't retreat from his tariffs unless other nations even out their trade with the U.S.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, the president said he didn't want global markets to fall but that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "Senior Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their trade policies, saying on Sunday that more than 50 countries subject to the latest round of tariffs have requested talks.",
      "Speaking on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs are \"definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. The president needs to reset global trade.\"",
      "Despite last week's market rout, some Wall Street economists expect the Trump administration to ease tariffs on certain countries in the months ahead in return for their lowering trade barriers. That would likely help shore up stocks.",
      "\"Our assumption is that, over the next few months Trump will make 'deals' with many countries, although China may be the exception,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"Once it becomes clear that he is willing to accept relatively minor concessions in exchange for scaling back those tariffs, equities should rebound.\"",

The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The fresh evacuation orders came a day after senior government officials said Israel would seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor across it. Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid on Gaza that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel says it is intended to pressure Hamas to release hostages and disarm.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.",
      "In the southern city of Khan Younis, officials said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital \u2013 nine of them from the same family. The dead included five children and four women. The bodies of another 19 people, including five children aged between 1 and 7 years and a pregnant woman, were taken to the European hospital near Khan Younis, hospital officials said. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.",
      "Later in the day, strikes killed four more people in Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, and another two people were killed in central Gaza and taken to Al Aqsa Hospital.",
      "The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in southern Gaza. U.N. officials say 15 Palestinian medics and emergency responders were killed, and their bodies and ambulances were buried by Israeli soldiers in a mass grave.",
      "The military initially said the ambulances were operating suspiciously and that nine militants were killed. The military said the probe would be led by an expert fact-finding body \"responsible for examining exceptional incidents\" during the war. Rights groups say such Israeli investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.",
      "The head of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, said Thursday he believed some of the medics were still alive when they were overtaken by Israeli forces. The organization's radio dispatchers heard a conversation in Hebrew between medics and Israeli soldiers after the ambulances had come under fire, Al-Khatib told members of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. Security Council he was turning over a video he obtained, allegedly showing the moments leading up to the Israeli killing of 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza.",
      "Mansour said the video shows that the aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, were traveling in emergency vehicles with the lights on at night to deconflict with Israeli Defense Forces. But, Mansour said, the video \"found on the body of one of the martyrs,\" shows that the Israeli army ambushed the vehicle despite the emergency lights.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 50,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. In an update on Friday, the ministry said 1,249 people had been killed in Gaza since March 18, when Israel resumed strikes, ending a ceasefire in the Palestinian territory.",
      "Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The war has left most of Gaza in ruins and at its height displaced around 90% of the population.",
      "The war began when Israel retaliated immediately for the Hamas-led terrorist attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 others taken as hostages back into Gaza, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Israel rescued eight living hostages and has recovered dozens of bodies.",

    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 11:16:07 -0400",
    "summary": "As world leaders wrung their hands over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcements, Argentine president Javier Milei was feted at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

    "story": [
      "An African giant pouched rat is being honored in the record books after detecting more than 100 landmines and other undetonated explosives in Cambodia, Belgian non-profit APOPO announced Friday.",
      "The rat, named Ronin, was named APOPO's most successful Mine Detection Rat. He also was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records.",
      "Since August 2021, Ronin has detected 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance, APOPO said. The record-smashing rodent is expected to do another two years or more of detection work, the non-profit said.",
      "\"Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of positive reinforcement training. He's not just an asset; he's a valued partner and colleague,\" said Phanny, Ronin's handler, in a news release from APOPO.",
      "The previous record was held by the African giant pouched rat Magawa, who detected 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance over the course of five years.",
      "APOPO has been training mine-detecting rats for over 25 years. Ronin underwent clicker training, where the rat learns to associate the sound of a click with a treat, to motivate him to learn how to smell explosives. He was also trained to work systemically within a grid pattern and to indicate landmines by scratching at the ground. Ronin and rats like him work for about 30 minutes a day, APOPO said. When they reach a certain age, they are moved to a retirement community and remain under APOPO's care. Magawa, the previous record-holder, was retired in 2021 and died in 2022.",
      "Undetonated landmines and ordnance are a huge problem in Cambodia. Decades of conflict have left up to six million unexploded munitions in the country's soil, according to the Landmine Monitor's 2024 report. Since 1979, those buried bombs have caused about 20,000 deaths and 45,000 injuries, the Landmine Monitor reported. Demining efforts have been underway for decades, including the work done by Ronin and other APOPO rats. In 2023, there were only 32 reported casualties involving landmines in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor. The site does not distinguish between injuries and deaths when referring to casualties.",
      "The APOPO's efforts are not limited to Cambodia. The non-profit estimates that about 110 million landmines are buried across 60 countries. In 2023, 1,431 deaths were connected to these landmines. The agency said it continues to work to remove landmines and unexploded ordnance from the world.",
      "\"When we launched APOPO, the common view was that it would take around 500 years to clear all landmines from the Earth's surface,\" said Christine Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \"25 years later, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and if the international community fully supports the collaboration of all demining operators, we could clear the remaining minefields in our lifetime.\"",

      "Maseru, Lesotho \u2014 President Trump in March described Lesotho as a place \"nobody has ever heard of,\" and then this week he hit the tiny African kingdom with the highest of his \"reciprocal\" trade tariffs for any single nation.",
      "Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs included a whopping 50% levy on the small, impoverished nation's imports, and the Lesotho government quickly said it would send a delegation to Washington.",
      "\"We need to urgently travel to the U.S. to engage with its executives and plead our case,\" Trade Minister Mokhethi Shelile told reporters Thursday. \"My biggest concern was the immediate closure of factories and job losses.\"",
      "Lesotho's annual gross domestic product of $2 billion is highly reliant on exports, mostly of textiles, including jeans.",
      "\"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"",
      "He said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.",
      "\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"",
      "To determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many\u00a0foreign governments have complained\u00a0the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",

      "The economy has been heavily reliant on textile exports bound for the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for some African products. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on African nations has raised questions over how likely the White House is to renew the AGOA pact when it expires in September.",
      "Its traditional Basotho blankets are a national symbol and renowned for their vibrant patterns and woolen warmth. They are often loaded with meaning, from celebrating life and nationality, to fertility and royalty, peace, love and courage.",

Access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and clean water remains limited, contributing to poor health outcomes and educational attainment.

      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",

      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

The new tariff matches the rate of the U.S. tariff announced by President Trump this week, which he called a \"reciprocal\" measure, claiming China had tariffs and other measures in place on U.S. goods already that amounted to a 67% trade barrier.",
      "For Mr. Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers, in reaching its decision on how heavily to tariff almost every other country in the world. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many foreign governments have complained the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "The Commerce Ministry in Beijing also said in a notice that it will impose more export controls on rare earths, which are materials used in high-tech products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries.",

    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea \u2014 South Korea's Constitutional Court removed impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol from office Friday, ending his tumultuous presidency and setting up an election to find a new leader, four months after he threw South Korean politics into turmoil with an ill-fated declaration of martial law.",
      "The unanimous verdict capped a dramatic fall for Yoon, a former star prosecutor who went from political novice to president in 2022, just a year after he entered politics.",
      "In a nationally televised verdict, the court's acting chief Moon Hyung-bae said the eight-member bench upheld Yoon's impeachment because his martial law decree seriously violated the constitution and other laws.",
      "\"The defendant not only declared martial law, but also violated the constitution and laws by mobilizing military and police forces to obstruct the exercise of legislative authority,\" Moon said. \"Ultimately, the declaration of martial law in this case violated the substantive requirements for emergency martial law.\"",
      "\"Given the grave negative impact on constitutional order and the significant ripple effects of the defendant's violations, we find that the benefits of upholding the constitution by removing the defendant from office far outweigh the national losses from the removal of a president,\" the justice concluded.",
      "At an anti-Yoon rally near the old royal palace that dominates downtown Seoul, people erupted into tears and danced when the verdict was announced. Two women wept as they hugged and an old man near them leapt to his feet and screamed with joy.",
      "The crowd later began marching through Seoul streets. Some people were dressed in cute blue bear costumes, a protest mascot that uses the opposition's colors.",
      "Outside Yoon's official residence, thousands of supporters cried and screamed when they saw the news of the verdict on a giant TV screen. They waved South Korean and U.S. flags and chanted slogans.",
      "\"We will absolutely not be shaken!\" a protest leader shouted on stage. \"Anyone who accepts this ruling and prepares for an early presidential election is our enemy.\"",
      "No major violence was immediately reported.",
      "What's next for South Korea",
      "An election will be held within two months to replace Yoon, but a festering national divide over Yoon's impeachment will likely continue and could complicate South Korea's efforts to deal with President Trump's \"America First\" policies and North Korea's expanding ties with Russia, observers say.",
      "Yoon said in a statement issued via his defense team that he deeply regrets failing to live up to the public's expectations, but stopped short of explicitly accepting the verdict. There have been fears he would incite efforts to resist his removal, since he earlier vowed to fight to the end.",
      "He added that he will pray for the country and its people. \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve our nation,\" Yoon said.",
      "Yoon's ruling People Power Party said it would accept the decision, but one of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kap-keun, called the ruling \"completely incomprehensible\" and a \"pure political decision.\"",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, the country's acting leader, vowed in a televised speech to ensure \"there are no gaps in national security and diplomacy\" and maintain public safety and order. Han was appointed prime minister, the country's No.2 official, by Yoon.",
      "\"Respecting the will of our sovereign people, I will do my utmost to manage the next presidential election in accordance with the constitution and the law, ensuring a smooth transition to the next administration,\" Han said.",
      "Surveys show Lee Jae-myung, leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, is the early favorite to win the election to choose Yoon's successor. Lee is facing trials for corruption and other charges.",
      "Lee welcomed the ruling and credited the South Korean people for \"protecting our democratic republic.\"",
      "\"The courage of the people who stood in the face of guns, swords and tanks, along with the bravery of troops who refused to obey unjust orders, has led to this great revolution of light,\" Lee said.",
      "Nation still reeling from brief imposition of martial law",
      "Martial law lasted only six hours, but left behind a political crisis, rattling financial markets and unsettling the country's diplomatic partners. In January, Yoon was separately arrested and indicted by prosecutors on alleged rebellion in connection with his decree, a charge that carries the death penalty or a life sentence if convicted.",
      "Under Yoon's decree, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, hundreds of soldiers were dispatched to the assembly, election offices and other sites. Special operations soldiers smashed windows at the National Assembly and scuffled with citizens gathered to protest, shocking South Koreans and evoking traumatic memories of military rule.",
      "Enough lawmakers, including some from the ruling party, managed to enter the assembly to vote down his decree unanimously.",
      "No major violence occurred during the brief period of martial law, but some senior military and police officers sent to the assembly have testified that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to block a vote on his decree or to detain his political rivals. Yoon says the troops were deployed to the assembly simply to maintain order.",
      "Yoon, 64, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly on Dec. 14. The assembly accused him of violating the constitution and other laws by suppressing assembly activities, attempting to detain politicians, and undermining peace across the country.",
      "In his final testimony at the Constitutional Court hearing, Yoon said his decree was a desperate attempt to draw public support of his fight against the \"wickedness\" of the Democratic Party, which had obstructed his agenda, impeached top officials and slashed the government's budget bill. He earlier called the National Assembly \"a den of criminals\" and \"anti-state forces.\"",
      "Some experts say Yoon may have imposed military rule to head off a possible independent investigation into scandals involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Without presidential immunity, Yoon could face other criminal charges, such as abuse of power. He's the first South Korean president to be arrested or indicted while in office.",
      "Yoon served as prosecutor-general under his predecessor, liberal President Moon Jae-in, before joining the now-ruling party in 2021 following disputes with Moon allies. A public image as strong-minded and uncompromising helped him defeat Lee in the close-fought 2022 presidential election. But after becoming president, Yoon has faced criticism that he refused to replace officials implicated in scandals and vetoed many bills passed by the assembly.",

    "story": [
      "Tested's Adam Savage paired up with Medtronic to offer his commentary on what can contribute to a longer lifespan, including possible differences between men's and women's health.",
      "Former \"MythBusters\" star Adam Savage is exploring the science of longevity, asking how lifestyle choices, stress and even sleep affect how long we live.",
      "Savage, now a YouTube creator and head of the channel Tested, has partnered with health technology company Medtronic to engage in discussions about longevity. While not a researcher himself, he has taken a deep dive into scientific insights from experts and reflected on his own experiences.",
      "\"Longevity has always been a fascination for me,\" Savage told Fox News Digital\u00a0in an exclusive interview.\u00a0\"I mean, who doesn\u2019t want to know how to live better and maybe even longer? But the real question is what actually works?\"",

      "Adam Savage speaks at MegaCon Orlando 2025 at the Orange County Convention Center Feb. 8, 2025, in Orlando, Fla. (Gerardo Mora/Getty Images)",
      "He credits his \"MythBusters\" experience with fueling his passion for scientific exploration.",
      "\"Making that show legitimized the practice of science and engineering to me,\" Savage said. \"It made me realize how much of our world can be tested, questioned and improved through experimentation.\"",
      "Through his discussions with people on the street for Medtronic, Savage has uncovered key lifestyle factors affecting longevity. He noted a cultural shift in what we consider to be old age, highlighting that people today consider themselves \"young-ish\" for longer.",
      "Savage also pointed to Blue Zones, regions known for long life expectancy, but questioned whether longevity there stems simply from location or cultural practices.",
      "\"We assume people in these areas live longer because of where they are, but what if it\u2019s really just the way they live? That\u2019s the part that fascinates me,\" he said.\u00a0AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS",
      "\"There\u2019s no magic secret. It\u2019s a mix of daily habits \u2014 what you eat, how you move, how you interact with your community, how you handle stress. All those things matter.\"",
      "Savage has taken a personal interest in testing different longevity strategies in his own life. He spoke candidly with Fox News Digital about his journey with intermittent fasting, which helped him lose 25 pounds and eliminate sleep apnea.",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy how much of a difference it made,\" he said. \"I didn\u2019t just lose weight. I felt sharper, I slept better and I stopped snoring. It was like flipping a switch on my health.\"",
      "He also reflected on his past smoking habits and what it took to quit.",
      "\"I had to admit I wasn\u2019t smoking for enjoyment,\" Savage said. \"I was just doing it out of habit. Once I realized that, it was easy to quit.\"",
      "Medtronic is investigating how science can extend our lives. Savage believes that lifestyle choices and community have been beneficial in his own life. (iStock)",
      "On alcohol, Savage dismissed the idea of a universal approach, arguing that studies conflict. While he personally cut back, he emphasized that people shouldn\u2019t feel guilty about their lifestyle choices.",
      "\"I'm a big believer in not feeling guilty about the things that you do to the core, whether it's smoking, whether it's watching something dumb or puzzling for 100 hours at a time,\" he said. \"I don't care about any of those. We all do these things to sort of bring relaxation and down regulate. I just think that alcohol is an especially poor down regulator in the final analysis.\"",
      "Beyond lifestyle choices, medical advancements are playing an increasingly critical role in extending both lifespan and \"healthspan,\" the years we live without serious disease. Medtronic, which focuses on healthcare technology globally, has developed medical devices designed to manage chronic conditions, improve heart health and advance minimally invasive surgeries.",
      "According to Medtronic, as people live longer, the focus is shifting toward enhancing not just lifespan but quality of life. The company\u2019s latest innovations include artificial intelligence-driven healthcare monitoring, robotic-assisted surgeries and advanced pacemakers, all aimed at improving long-term health outcomes. Savage also spoke about the psychological aspects of aging, emphasizing that mindset and community play a significant role in longevity.",
      "Medtronic claims the first person to live to 150 may already have been born. When asked if there is an upper limit to human life, Savage replied, \"I think right now 150 is a very realistic target to be shooting for and to be discussing.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"That's really what science foreshadowing is,\" added Savage. \"It's about asking these questions and seeing, \u2018OK, what numbers are unrealistic.\u2019 I think 40 years ago, 150 would have seemed radically unrealistic. Today it seems more realistic, and I think it's entirely reasonable that, let's say, by 2040, we may all have a different cultural answer to that question.\"",

      "The House and Senate must be on the same page and adopt the same budget blueprint in order for the Senate to use a process called \"budget reconciliation\" to avoid a filibuster. A filibuster would kill the bill because Republicans lack 60 yeas to break a filibuster in the Senate. So they have to use budget reconciliation. The House and Senate cannot delve into the guts of the \"big, beautiful bill\" until they both adopt the same budget framework. Otherwise, they are dead in the water.",
      "The Senate prepped a measure that didn\u2019t include cuts as deep as demanded by the House for a reason. First, such deep cuts would never command the necessary votes to pass the bill in the Senate. Secondly, Senate Republicans are bound by special budget rules. Thus, their cuts can\u2019t be as deep. However, Senate GOP sources have repeatedly told Fox that they are trying to establish a \"floor\" for cuts. Not a \"ceiling.\"",

      "Either way, the House and Senate are not on the same page. And they cannot begin dealing with the actual bill until they are. After two \"vote-a-ramas\" in the Senate (where senators vote round-the-clock for hours on a budget measure), some Senate GOPers have indicated that the Senate would not do a third vote-a-rama.

Considering volatility in the markets and overall economic uncertainty, there is concern that Congress may need to address the debt ceiling sooner rather than later. The current estimation is that lawmakers have until summertime to address the debt ceiling.

Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command.

      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "How to protect yourself",
      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

      "How to reset your router remotely (the right way)",
      "Before we start, though, it's important to note that you will need administrator access to your router. Luckily, this is simple if it's your own home router. Unless you've changed the settings, your router uses the default username and password for its model, which you can find by a simple web search. However, leaving your router at default settings is a serious security risk. Make sure to change the default login and local IP address as soon as possible.",
      "If you're at home, you can use your local network IP (typically http://192.168.1.1) to log in to your router. This only works when your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is known as LAN (Local Area Network) access.",
      "If you're away from home (like at work or in a hotel), you won\u2019t be able to use 192.168.x.x to access your router. Instead, you\u2019d need to use your router\u2019s public IP address (also called WAN address). This requires setting up remote access in advance, usually by enabling remote management, Dynamic DNS or using a VPN. Be aware that this can open your network up to security vulnerabilities if not done carefully.",
      "Important: Allowing your router to be administered from the internet (WAN) is not recommended for most users due to the significant security risks. If you choose to do this, use strong, unique passwords, and consider VPN access instead.",
      "Use your ISP\u2019s app",
      "The safest and easiest method \u2014 if available \u2014 is to use your internet service provider\u2019s app. Most of the major ISPs in North America now allow you to reset your networking equipment remotely via a smartphone app, making it even easier to reset your router. This assumes you are using their router and not one you purchased for yourself. If you use a third-party router, you'll need to follow the steps above to reset it. Using an ISP app avoids opening your home network to the internet directly and usually includes built-in security protections.",

      "A smart plug lets you power cycle your router from anywhere by turning the plug off and on using a mobile app. This is a much safer option than enabling remote router access. It doesn't require exposing your router to the internet.",
      "Smart plugs come with smartphone apps that will allow you to set schedules and remotely turn and off and on plugs around your house, including the plug you plug your router into.",

For remote access, you'd need your router\u2019s public IP and advanced setup, which can be risky if not secured properly.

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:00:48 -0400",
    "summary": "Experts say hackers who used to focus on Windows operating systems are increasingly targeting Apple IDs as part of a new phishing campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "If there\u2019s one thing that has become clear over the past year, it\u2019s that Apple devices are not as secure as the company wants you to believe.",
      "We\u2019re four months into 2025 and there have already been over 10 instances in which attackers specifically targeted Apple users, and these are just the incidents we know of.",
      "I\u2019ll admit no device is foolproof, but there seems to be a growing trend where bad actors prefer targeting Apple users over other platforms. In fact, security researchers have recently identified a new phishing campaign in which hackers, who previously focused on Windows, are now setting their sights on Apple IDs.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A person working on an Apple laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0LayerX Labs have uncovered a new phishing campaign that specifically targets Mac users, marking a shift from its previous focus on Windows. The attackers initially lured Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts designed to steal login credentials. However, after Microsoft, Chrome and Firefox implemented new security features to block these attacks, the hackers started redirecting their efforts toward Mac users instead.",
      "The new attack closely mirrors its predecessor but with key modifications. The phishing pages have been redesigned to resemble Apple\u2019s security warnings, making them appear legitimate to macOS users. The attack code has also been adjusted to specifically detect macOS and Safari users, ensuring that only Apple users see the fraudulent pages.",
      "Plus, despite shifting their focus, the attackers continue to host these phishing pages on Microsoft\u2019s Windows[.]net domain. Since this is a trusted Microsoft platform, it allows the phishing pages to evade detection by security tools that assess risk based on domain reputation.",

      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "How victims are lured in",
      "The phishing campaign exploits common yet highly effective methods called typosquatting and malicious redirects. Victims often end up on these phishing pages after making a simple mistake, such as mistyping a URL while trying to visit a legitimate website.",
      "Instead of reaching the intended site, they land on a compromised domain parking page. From there, they are redirected through multiple websites before ultimately arriving at the phishing page, which presents a fake Apple security warning. Believing their Apple ID is at risk, victims are tricked into entering their credentials, unknowingly handing them over to the attackers.",
      "One notable case involved a person using Safari who was working at a business secured by a Secure Web Gateway. Despite the organization\u2019s security measures, the phishing attempt managed to bypass the gateway\u2019s protections.",

      "7 ways to stay safe from attackers targeting Apple users",
      "Phishing campaigns are increasingly targeting macOS users, but you\u2019re not defenseless. Here are four essential steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A reliable antivirus program is your first line of defense against phishing attempts and malicious websites. While Apple\u2019s built-in security features provide some protection, they aren\u2019t foolproof, especially against sophisticated phishing attacks that mimic legitimate Apple warnings. A robust antivirus solution can detect and block malicious sites before you even reach them, preventing you from accidentally entering your credentials on a fraudulent page. Additionally, advanced security software can identify suspicious redirects and alert you before you fall victim to typosquatting traps.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular\u00a0updates to macOS and your applications aren\u2019t just about new features. They\u2019re critical patches that fix security vulnerabilities. Attackers are quick to exploit any weakness, so ensuring your operating system and all installed software are current minimizes the risk of a breach. Enable automatic updates where possible so you\u2019re always protected by the latest security enhancements.",
      "3. Regularly monitor your Apple ID activity: Even with strong security measures in place, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your Apple ID account for any signs of unauthorized access. Apple allows users to review their account activity, including devices logged into the account and recent changes. Regularly check your Apple ID settings to ensure that only trusted devices are connected and that no suspicious activity has occurred. If you notice anything unusual, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, immediately change your password and remove unauthorized devices. This proactive approach can help you catch potential breaches early and minimize damage.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Strong, unique passwords for every account are essential, but they\u2019re even more effective when combined with\u00a0two-factor authentication. Even if attackers manage to steal your credentials through a phishing attack,\u00a02FA adds an extra barrier that makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use a recovery key for enhanced security: Apple offers an optional feature called a recovery key, which is a 28-character code that provides an extra layer of security for your Apple ID. When you enable a recovery key, Apple disables its standard account recovery process, meaning you\u2019ll need this key, along with access to a trusted device or phone number, to reset your password or regain access to your account. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to take control of your account.",
      "To set up a recovery key, go to\u00a0Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-in & Security > Recovery Key on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Follow the prompts to generate and confirm your recovery key. Be sure to write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or with a trusted family member. Keep in mind that losing both your recovery key and access to trusted devices can permanently lock you out of your account. However, if used responsibly, this feature gives you greater control over your account\u2019s security.",
      "6. Enable biometric authentication: Apple devices offer advanced\u00a0biometric authentication options like Face ID and Touch ID, which provide an extra layer of security. These features make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your device or sensitive accounts, even if they manage to steal your credentials. Enable biometric authentication wherever possible, especially for apps and services that store personal or financial information. Since biometric data is unique to you, it adds a level of protection that passwords alone cannot provide.",
      "7. Practice safe browsing:\u00a0Many attacks rely on simple user mistakes, such as mistyping a URL or clicking on suspicious links. Always verify that you\u2019re visiting legitimate websites before entering any personal information. Be skeptical of unexpected security alerts, even if they mimic Apple\u2019s design. Learning to identify the subtle signs of phishing, like unusual URL structures or generic greetings, can help you avoid falling for these scams.",
      "HOW TO PROTECT YOUR IPHONE & IPAD FROM MALWARE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Apple has long sold the idea that its ecosystem is inherently safer than the alternatives, but that claim is starting to wear thin. The reality is that attackers are no longer ignoring Mac users, they\u2019re actively targeting them, and Apple\u2019s response has been anything but proactive. While Microsoft, Google and others roll out new security measures to counter evolving threats, Apple remains slow to adapt, relying on outdated assumptions about its platform\u2019s safety.",

      "Ransomware is a major threat to every industry. In recent years, hackers have increasingly targeted companies with ransomware, locking their data unless a ransom is paid. In some cases, they also threaten to leak the stolen data online if the company refuses to comply, as seen in the UnitedHealth breach, where hackers reportedly demanded $22 million.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI is warning businesses, particularly those in the healthcare sector, about a scam involving physical ransom letters sent via the U.S. Postal Service. These letters, falsely claiming to be from the ransomware group BianLian, demand Bitcoin payments ranging from $150,000 to $500,000 in exchange for not leaking supposedly stolen data.",
      "Marked with \"TIME SENSITIVE READ IMMEDIATELY,\" the letters allege that the attackers gained access through social engineering and exfiltrated sensitive files. However, no proof is provided, and investigations have found no signs of actual ransomware intrusions in affected organizations. The letters appear to be templated, with only minor variations, and include a QR code linked to a Bitcoin wallet. Some also feature a compromised password, likely to make the threat seem more credible.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Sent from Boston with U.S. flag stamps, these letters differ significantly in tone and wording from known BianLian communications. Authorities believe this is a fear-based scam designed to trick organizations into paying a ransom for a breach that never happened.",

These attacks do not just put data at risk. They also disrupt hospitals, slow down care and create chaos for doctors and patients.",
      "The\u00a0Ascension cyberattack in May 2024 is a clear example. Hackers locked medical staff out of critical systems, shut down phone lines and blocked tools needed for tests, procedures and medications. At first, the breach was reported with an estimated 500 affected individuals, but by December, that number had jumped to nearly 5.6 million.",
      "UnitedHealth\u2019s\u00a0Change Healthcare unit experienced a massive data breach in February 2024 that further highlighted the vulnerability of the sector. Initially reported to have affected around 100 million people, the number later grew to 190 million, making it the largest medical data breach in U.S. history.",
      "This breach affected nearly half of the country\u2019s population. UnitedHealth attributed the attack to ALPHV/BlackCat, a Russian-speaking ransomware group that later claimed responsibility for the attack before being dismantled by law enforcement.",

      "7 ways to avoid ransomware attacks (and fake ransomware scams)",
      "1. Install strong antivirus software and regularly update software:\u00a0The first line of defense against ransomware is ensuring that your systems are equipped with the latest security tools. Keep all software and devices\u00a0up to date to avoid vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Install firewalls,\u00a0strong antivirus software and intrusion detection systems to block malicious activities before they can cause harm. Regularly patch operating systems and applications to stay ahead of cybercriminals. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Implement strong password policies and use a password manager: Ensure all passwords are unique, at least 15 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This reduces the risk of password reuse and weak passwords, which are common entry points for ransomware attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "3. Educate and train employees on cybersecurity awareness:\u00a0Many ransomware attacks start with phishing emails or social engineering tactics. As seen in the scam targeting executives, attackers often use fear-based tactics to manipulate victims into acting quickly. Train your employees, particularly high-level executives, to recognize suspicious emails, fraudulent requests and phishing attempts.",
      "4. Backup data and maintain a secure recovery plan:\u00a0Data backups are a critical safeguard against ransomware. Regularly back up critical data to secure, offline locations that ransomware cannot access. Testing your recovery plans frequently ensures that if an attack does occur, you can recover quickly with minimal impact on operations. In addition, consider using a cloud service with encryption to ensure that even if an attack happens, the backup remains safe.",
      "5.\u00a0Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Two-factor authentication is an essential security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to sensitive systems and data. With 2FA, even if attackers manage to obtain login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access critical systems without the second factor of authentication, whether it\u2019s a code sent to a phone or biometric verification.",
      "6. Verify threats before taking action:\u00a0If you receive a ransom demand (digital or physical), investigate its legitimacy. Scams often lack proof of data breaches or network compromise. Consult cybersecurity experts or law enforcement before responding.",
      "7. Report suspicious activity: Notify law enforcement or organizations like the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you encounter scams or ransomware threats. Reporting helps authorities track and mitigate these activities.",
      "FBI WARNS OF DANGEROUS NEW \u2018SMISHING\u2019 SCAM TARGETING YOUR PHONE",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare is seriously lagging when it comes to cybersecurity. It's crazy that so many health institutions don\u2019t have a CISO or a dedicated security team. Instead, the IT department, which isn\u2019t always trained in cybersecurity, gets stuck trying to handle it all. With so much sensitive data at risk, it\u2019s shocking that so many healthcare organizations still treat cybersecurity as an afterthought.",
      "Cyberattacks are only going to get worse, and unless the industry steps up its game, it\u2019s just a matter of time before more hospitals, clinics and health systems get hit. It\u2019s time to take security seriously.",

      "A disturbing new report reveals that violent political rhetoric online, including calls for the murder of public figures like President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, is being increasingly normalized, particularly on the left.",
      "The report, from Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), found that a growing number of people are willing to justify and even applaud killing in the name of politics and a warped sense of social justice. The chilling change appears to have accelerated in recent months.",
      "\"What was formerly taboo culturally has become acceptable,\" Joel Finkelstein, the lead author of the report, told Fox News Digital. \"We are seeing a clear shift \u2013 glorification, increased attempts and changing norms \u2013 all converging into what we define as \u2018assassination culture.\u2019\"",
      "The NCRI study traces the cultural shift back to the assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson by Luigi Mangione in December 2024. What followed, researchers say, was a viral wave of memes that turned Mangione into a folk hero.",
      "According to the study, these memes have sparked copycat behavior targeting other figures associated with wealth and conservative politics.",
      "NEW STUDY FINDS DEI INITIATIVES CREATING 'HOSTILE ATTRIBUTION BIAS'",
      "\"It\u2019s not just Luigi anymore,\" Finkelstein said. \"We're seeing an expansion: Trump, Musk and others are now being openly discussed as legitimate targets, often cloaked in meme culture and gamified online dialogue.\"",
      "A ballot measure in California, darkly named the Luigi Mangione Access to Health Care Act, is just one real-world outgrowth of this online movement.",
      "In this chart, over half of left-leaning respondents said killing Donald Trump would be at least \"somewhat justified,\" according to NCRI\u2019s national survey. The study found that 55% of self-identified left-of-center participants justified Trump\u2019s assassination to some degree, while 48% did the same for Elon Musk. Researchers say the findings reflect a growing tolerance for political violence among ideological extremists. (Network Contagion Research Institute)",
      "NCRI conducted a nationally representative survey of more than 1,200 U.S. adults, weighted to reflect national census demographics. The findings were stark: Some 38% of respondents said it would be at least \"somewhat justified\" to murder Donald Trump, and 31% said the same about Elon Musk.",
      "When counting only left-leaning respondents, justification for killing Trump rose to 55% and Musk to 48%.",

      "\"Property destruction wasn\u2019t just an outlier opinion, it clustered tightly with support for political assassinations and other forms of violence,\" said Finkelstein. \"This points to a coherent belief system, not just isolated grievances.\"",
      "Among left-of-center respondents, a large share rated the murder of Trump and Musk as either \"somewhat\" or \"completely justified,\" according to this histogram. The chart highlights the skew in support for political violence along ideological lines, with far-left participants scoring highest across all metrics. (Network Contagion Research Institute)",
      "\"Tesla has become a stand-in for broader frustrations about capitalism, tech power and conservative politics. Burning down a dealership isn't just a protest, it\u2019s a performance, a signal of belonging to a radical in-group.\"",
      "Finkelstein said that while some level of violent sentiment exists on the right, \"What we found was a statistically higher endorsement of political murder on the left, 41% more than among right-leaning participants.\"",
      "The report singles out BlueSky, a social media platform favored by progressive users, as a major amplifier of extremist ideation.",
      "\"BlueSky was modeled as a safe alternative to Twitter for the left, but what it\u2019s become is an extremist platform,\" Finkelstein said. \"It functions today much like 4chan or Gab once did for far-right ideologies. These platforms are now lead indicators of violent real-world trends.\"",
      "This correlation matrix shows that support for assassinations, property destruction and Mangione are all tightly linked, forming a belief system NCRI calls \"assassination culture.\" The study finds that left-wing authoritarianism was the strongest predictor for all categories of political violence.

      "According to NCRI\u2019s open-source analysis, BlueSky saw a spike in engagement on posts referencing Mangione, Trump and Musk, crossing over 200,000 posts and 2 million engagements in just months. Reddit currently hosts pro-Mangione communities with tens of thousands of members.",
      "Finkelstein believes the psychological roots of \"assassination culture\" are a mix of ideological radicalism and feelings of powerlessness, particularly in the aftermath of electoral losses.",
      "\"When people feel like they have no say, no future and no leadership offering vision, they become susceptible to radical ideation,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s when the memes turn into permission structures for real violence.\"",
      "Multivariate regression analysis reveals that far-left ideology, the use of BlueSky and a sense of powerlessness (external locus of control) are the leading predictors of support for political violence. The chart breaks down which psychological and demographic traits most strongly align with justifying the murder of Musk and Trump or attacks on Tesla dealerships. (Network Contagion Research Institute)",
      "A key predictor identified in the study is external locus of control, which is the belief that one's life is governed by outside forces.",
      "\"Combine that with extreme partisanship, and you get an explosive mix,\" Finkelstein said.",
      "Finkelstein does not believe censorship will end \"assassination culture,\" but strong leadership just might.",
      "\"We are not an anti-free speech organization,\" said Finkelstein. \"But we know what a threat is. And what\u2019s happening online on platforms like BlueSky represents a significant threat to American democratic values. If leaders on the left explicitly condemn these trends and reassert moral norms, they can dismantle this culture quickly,\" he said. \"It\u2019s about reminding people there is a future worth striving for that doesn\u2019t involve glorifying political violence.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s about reminding people there is a future worth striving for that doesn\u2019t involve glorifying political violence.\"",

      "India's parliament passed a controversial bill moved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government to amend laws governing Muslim land endowments, while Muslim groups and opposition parties protested the move.",

      "What\u2019s a waqf?",
      "Waqfs are a traditional type of Islamic charitable foundation in which a donor permanently sets aside property \u2014 often but not always real estate \u2014 for religious or charitable purposes. Waqf properties cannot be sold or transferred.",
      "Waqfs in India control 872,000 properties that cover 405,000 hectares (1 million acres) of land, worth an estimated $14.22 billion. Some of these endowments date back centuries, and many are used for mosques, seminaries, graveyards and orphanages.",

      "\"The (non-Muslim) members will monitor whether the administration is running as per law or not, and whether the donations are being used for what they were intended or not,\" he said.",
      "Muslim groups, like The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said such comments were against the fundamentals of Islamic endowments as such bodies necessarily need to be governed by Muslims only. The board said the bill was \"a blatant infringement on the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens\" and called on citizens to hit the streets against it.",
      "Mallikarjun Kharge, the Congress president, said, \"Why should waqf bodies allow non-Muslims as members when Hindu temple trusts don\u2019t allow people of other religions in their fold?\"",
      "One of the most controversial changes is to ownership rules, which could impact historical mosques, shrines, and graveyards, since many such properties lack formal documentation as they were donated without legal records decades, and even centuries, ago.",

      "Other changes could impact mosques on land held in centuries-old waqfs.",
      "Radical Hindu groups have laid claim to several mosques around India, arguing they are built on the ruins of important Hindu temples. Many such cases are pending in courts.",
      "The law would require waqf boards to seek approval from a district level officer to confirm the waqfs\u2019 claims to property.",
      "Critics say that would undermine the board and could lead to Muslims being stripped of their land. It\u2019s not clear how often the boards would be asked to confirm such claims to land.",
      "\"The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is a weapon aimed at marginalizing Muslims and usurping their personal laws and property rights,\" Rahul Gandhi, the main opposition leader, wrote on social media platform X.

      "Last month, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its annual report that religious freedom conditions in India continued to deteriorate while Modi and his party \"propagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities\" during last year\u2019s election campaign.",

      "An unfounded claim that President Donald Trump was considering pausing the implementation of sizable tariffs briefly sent U.S. stocks skyrocketing on Monday, an indication of just how volatile the current economic situation has become.",
      "Just after 10:10 a.m., a headline was posted by several well-followed finance-focused accounts on X that said White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had indicated\u00a0that Trump was considering a 90-day pause \u2014 China excluded \u2014 on his sweeping tariffs plan.",

The move resulted in trillions in gains in stock-market value in a matter of minutes.",

      "A search of X shows that the first post mentioning Hassett and the pause came at 10:11 a.m. appears to have come from the account @yourfavorito, a finance-focused account with relatively few followers that regularly posts headlines about daily business developments. Identical or near-identical language was later posted by larger accounts, including some that are well followed in the finance world. Some of those posts have since been deleted.",
      "The account that appears to have been the first to post the all-caps headline, which goes by a pseudonym, told NBC News their post was a reaction to seeing the headline on CNBC and Reuters, and pointed to a Reuters headline posted at 10:20 a.m., nine minutes after their own post.",

      "While it remains unclear exactly who first started the false Hassett claim, the swing highlights just how sensitive markets are to any hope that Trump will back down from his tariff plan, which dramatically overshadows any existing duties and has been roundly criticized by global leaders and business magnates.",
      "But it is not the first time a social media rumor has dramatically affected markets. In 2012, The Associated Press\u2019 Twitter account was hacked and used to post an erroneous headline of a bombing at the White House. U.S. markets dropped sharply on the post."

      "Bravo aired a controversial moment from \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta\" on Sunday that led to the exit of star Kenya Moore, an incident from last year when she showed sexually explicit photos of a fellow cast member.",
      "The incident first became public in June 2024, when TMZ reported that Moore showed the images of new cast member Brittany Eady at an event. Moore was reportedly placed on suspension and eventually parted ways with Bravo.",
      "This season's fifth episode showed the incident on Sunday, but Bravo did not allow the images to be aired.",
      "Tensions between Moore and Eady boiled over in the prior episode when the two got into a verbal argument at a cast dinner. By the end, Eady made threatening remarks as she left, insinuating she'd shoot Moore.",
      "\"I still got my pistols, so,\" Eady said at one point. She later followed up with, \"I don't play them games. I got whips ... pistols, everything.\"",
      "Members of production are seen on camera as Eady is making the comments, momentarily breaking the fourth wall, but are not shown speaking to Eady as others attempt to calm her down.",

      "\"She was talking about how, 'I still got my pistol on me,'\" Moore is heard saying off camera. \"This girl is a problem. She gotta go.\"",
      "The episode ends there, and the following week Eady expressed contrition about her remarks to other cast members. She appeared at the grand opening party of Moore's salon with flowers to apologize.",
      "Moore ignored the attempted apology and had apparently already decided to respond to the threats by using the party to humiliate Eady by showing sexually explicit images of her.  Eady left the event before the images were shown.",
      "\"So this woman was saying all this stuff like, 'You don't know who the f--- I am,'\" Moore told the crowd, referring to Eady. \"I'm like, no I don't know who you are. So I did a little research.\"",
      "Moore pulled out poster boards with the images of Eady and showed them to the crowd while cameras were rolling. The images were not shown on camera, but described by others.",
      "Fellow \"Real Housewives\" cast members were visibly uncomfortable by Moore's display and told Moore she was going \"too far.\"",
      "\"No, it ain't too far ... she threatened me with a gun,\" Moore told them. \"Don't tell me it's too far.\"",
      "Cast member Porsha Williams said in her confessional interview that she was mortified and was filmed leaving the opening party along with multiple other cast members. Williams then told production she was ready to go and no longer wanted to be filmed.",
      "Eady clearly did not consent to the images being shown at the event. Eady posted to Instagram on Sunday, captioning a short video of herself by writing, \"I\u2019m still standing strong no matter what.\"",
      "She did not address the incident during the episode.",
      "Bravo did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News.",
      "The episode ended with a title card that read: \"Based on Kenya's behavior, the decision was made to cease filming with her this season.\"",

    "summary": "The court said, however, that the administration can't deport people without due process.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the order of a federal judge who had blocked the removal of men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador without any legal process under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The 5-4 ruling essentially clears the path for the Trump administration to resume deportations under the rarely used wartime law, so long as detainees are given due process. That means they must be given time to challenge their detentions and make the administration prove the legality of their confinements.",
      "\u201cAEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\u201d the court wrote in its majority opinion.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The decision lifts orders issued by Washington-based U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked the move on March 15, while litigation continues. The original lawsuit was filed by five Venezuelans, with Boasberg provisionally certifying it as a class action that applies to all Venezuelans in U.S. custody who are not U.S. citizens.",
      "So far, Boasberg had issued only a temporary restraining order. He had also scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to decide whether to impose a longer-term preliminary injunction.",
      "Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent: \u201cThe Government\u2019s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. We, as a Nation and a court of law, should be better than this.\u201d",
      "Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson spoke to the historic nature of the ruling\u2019s being issued Monday before Boasberg has even held a hearing on a preliminary injunction.",
      "\u201cWith more and more of our most significant rulings taking place in the shadows of our emergency docket, today\u2019s Court leaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We are just as wrong now as we have been in the past, with similarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are now less willing to face it,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\"At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,\u201d she added, citing the notorious ruling that allowed government confinement of Japanese Americans during World War II.",
      "The government previously indicated in court that if Boasberg's order was lifted, it would immediately begin deportations. On March 26, a federal appeals court voted 2-1 to decline an earlier request to block Boasberg's decision.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the ruling on X.",
      "\"An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump\u2019s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,\" Bondi wrote.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also lauded the ruling.",
      "\"Today\u2019s SCOTUS ruling is a victory for commonsense security\u2014 an activist judge cannot stop the will of the American people for a safe and secure homeland,\" she said in a post on X.",
      "Both sides claimed a level of victory.",
      "Lee Gelernt, lead attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs who were deported, said overall they were pleased with the court's ruling.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but\u00a0the critical point is that the Court rejected the government\u2019s remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act,\" he said in a statement. \"That is a big\u00a0victory.\u201d",
      "The fast-moving case concerns Trump's aggressive and unprecedented use of presidential power in invoking an 18th century law called the Alien Enemies Act, which has been used only when the country was at war.",
      "\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country,\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in her request for the Supreme Court to intervene. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the president.\"",
      "The Trump administration announced in February that it had determined that Tren de Aragua was a terrorist organization and that its members had infiltrated the United States. The administration, in a move that has been contested, says the group is effectively an arm of the Venezuelan government, which is led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Trump then invoked the Alien Enemies Act, which can be used only when there are \"invasions of predatory incursions.\"",
      "By making those findings, the Trump administration concluded that Tren de Aragua members could be immediately detained and deported without an opportunity for judges to determine whether the Alien Enemies Act applied or whether the people involved were even members of the gang. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the government's points-based method for identifying whether people are members is seriously flawed, relying in part on whether they have tattoos, leading in some cases to non-gang members\u2019 being targeted.",
      "The administration has argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president almost unfettered power to remove designated immigrants at short notice despite the constitutional protection of due process.",
      "A key issue in the case, therefore, is whether courts have any role to play in assessing whether the law is being lawfully applied.",
      "The government argues that the only way detainees can challenge potential deportation is to file separate habeas corpus claims in the jurisdictions where they are held.",
      "The Venezuelan plaintiffs argued in their own filing that the implications of the government's argument are \"staggering\" because it could allow officials to target a disfavored immigrant group on a whim.",
      "A decision for the government would \"allow the government to immediately begin whisking away anyone else it unilaterally declares to be a member of a criminal gang to a brutal foreign prison,\" they said.",
      "They also noted that Boasberg's decision did not require any currently detained immigrants to be released or prevent deportations under different legal authorities. In fact, the Trump administration has continued to deport other immigrants to El Salvador.",
      "Boasberg's intervention prompted a barrage of hostile commentary from Trump and his allies, with Trump and others calling for the Boasberg to be impeached. That prompted a swift rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "Concerns were also raised about whether the administration had violated a verbal order from Boasberg in court that planes carrying alleged gang members turn around and return to the United States. Two flights subsequently landed in Honduras and El Salvador.",
      "Until Trump's announcement, the Alien Enemies Act had been invoked only during three major wars: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II."

      "Barclays analyst Tim Long wrote that he expects Apple to raise prices, or the company could suffer as much as a 15% cut to earnings per share. Apple may also be able to rearrange its supply chain so that imports to the U.S. come from other countries with lower tariffs.",

    "summary": "The court said, however, that the administration can't deport people without due process.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court on Monday threw out the order of a federal judge who had blocked the removal of men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador without any legal process under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The 5-4 ruling essentially clears the path for the Trump administration to resume deportations under the rarely used wartime law, so long as detainees are given due process. That means they must be given time to challenge their detentions and make the administration prove the legality of their confinements.",
      "\u201cAEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\u201d the court wrote in its majority opinion.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The decision lifts orders issued by Washington-based U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked the move on March 15, while litigation continues. The original lawsuit was filed by five Venezuelans, with Boasberg provisionally certifying it as a class action that applies to all Venezuelans in U.S. custody who are not U.S. citizens.",
      "So far, Boasberg had issued only a temporary restraining order. He had also scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to decide whether to impose a longer-term preliminary injunction.",
      "Liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent: \u201cThe Government\u2019s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. We, as a Nation and a court of law, should be better than this.\u201d",
      "Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson spoke to the historic nature of the ruling\u2019s being issued Monday before Boasberg has even held a hearing on a preliminary injunction.",
      "\u201cWith more and more of our most significant rulings taking place in the shadows of our emergency docket, today\u2019s Court leaves less and less of a trace. But make no mistake: We are just as wrong now as we have been in the past, with similarly devastating consequences. It just seems we are now less willing to face it,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\"At least when the Court went off base in the past, it left a record so posterity could see how it went wrong,\u201d she added, citing the notorious ruling that allowed government confinement of Japanese Americans during World War II.",
      "The government previously indicated in court that if Boasberg's order was lifted, it would immediately begin deportations. On March 26, a federal appeals court voted 2-1 to decline an earlier request to block Boasberg's decision.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi praised the ruling on X.",
      "\"An activist judge in Washington, DC does not have the jurisdiction to seize control of President Trump\u2019s authority to conduct foreign policy and keep the American people safe,\" Bondi wrote.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also lauded the ruling.",
      "\"Today\u2019s SCOTUS ruling is a victory for commonsense security\u2014 an activist judge cannot stop the will of the American people for a safe and secure homeland,\" she said in a post on X.",
      "Both sides claimed a level of victory.",
      "Lee Gelernt, lead attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs who were deported, said overall they were pleased with the court's ruling.",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but\u00a0the critical point is that the Court rejected the government\u2019s remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act,\" he said in a statement. \"That is a big\u00a0victory.\u201d",
      "The fast-moving case concerns Trump's aggressive and unprecedented use of presidential power in invoking an 18th century law called the Alien Enemies Act, which has been used only when the country was at war.",
      "\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country,\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in her request for the Supreme Court to intervene. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the president.\"",
      "The Trump administration announced in February that it had determined that Tren de Aragua was a terrorist organization and that its members had infiltrated the United States. The administration, in a move that has been contested, says the group is effectively an arm of the Venezuelan government, which is led by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Trump then invoked the Alien Enemies Act, which can be used only when there are \"invasions of predatory incursions.\"",
      "By making those findings, the Trump administration concluded that Tren de Aragua members could be immediately detained and deported without an opportunity for judges to determine whether the Alien Enemies Act applied or whether the people involved were even members of the gang. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say the government's points-based method for identifying whether people are members is seriously flawed, relying in part on whether they have tattoos, leading in some cases to non-gang members\u2019 being targeted.",
      "The administration has argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president almost unfettered power to remove designated immigrants at short notice despite the constitutional protection of due process.",
      "A key issue in the case, therefore, is whether courts have any role to play in assessing whether the law is being lawfully applied.",
      "The government argues that the only way detainees can challenge potential deportation is to file separate habeas corpus claims in the jurisdictions where they are held.",
      "The Venezuelan plaintiffs argued in their own filing that the implications of the government's argument are \"staggering\" because it could allow officials to target a disfavored immigrant group on a whim.",
      "A decision for the government would \"allow the government to immediately begin whisking away anyone else it unilaterally declares to be a member of a criminal gang to a brutal foreign prison,\" they said.",
      "They also noted that Boasberg's decision did not require any currently detained immigrants to be released or prevent deportations under different legal authorities. In fact, the Trump administration has continued to deport other immigrants to El Salvador.",
      "Boasberg's intervention prompted a barrage of hostile commentary from Trump and his allies, with Trump and others calling for the Boasberg to be impeached. That prompted a swift rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "Concerns were also raised about whether the administration had violated a verbal order from Boasberg in court that planes carrying alleged gang members turn around and return to the United States. Two flights subsequently landed in Honduras and El Salvador.",
      "Until Trump's announcement, the Alien Enemies Act had been invoked only during three major wars: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II."

Families and businesses can make more informed decisions when they can get weather information that often includes actions that should be taken based on the forecast.",
      "Norma Mendoza-Denton, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said there are many people in the U.S. that function with limited English relevant to their daily routines. For example, a shopkeeper might be able to have short conversations with customers but might not have the same understanding when it comes to reading weather or climate terminologies.",

    "story": [
      "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide, adding that he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\u201d on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids."

    "summary": "Democrats had accused Abbott of delaying calling a special election for the seat after Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, died in early March.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday said he had selected Nov. 4 as the date for the special election to fill the House seat that had been occupied by the late Rep. Sylvester Turner, D-Texas, who died unexpectedly in March.",
      "The decision means the deep-blue, Houston-based congressional seat will be vacant for roughly eight months.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other Democrats had accused Abbott of deliberately delaying calling the special election to help pad the GOP's tiny majority in the chamber. Republicans hold just a 220-213 advantage over Democrats in the House, meaning that Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can only afford three GOP defections on any vote.",
      "But in a statement Monday, Abbott pointed the finger at Harris County, saying that officials there do a poor job in conducting elections.",
      "\u201cThey repeatedly fail to conduct elections consistent with state law. Safe and secure elections are critical to the foundation of our state. Forcing Harris County to rush this special election on weeks\u2019 notice would harm the interests of voters,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThe appropriate time to hold this election is November, which will give Harris County sufficient time to prepare for such an important election.\u201d",
      "Abbott's announcement Monday came just hours after Jeffries held a news conference in the U.S. Capitol in which he criticized Abbott for \"conspiring\" with congressional Republicans to delay the special election. The district\u2019s roughly 800,000 constituents are predominantly Black and Hispanic.",
      "\"The Republicans are on the run on the economy, they\u2019re on the run on health care, they\u2019re on the run in the courts, they\u2019re on the run electorally, and they\u2019re on the run legislatively,\" Jeffries told reporters, \"which is why Gov. Abbott is conspiring with House Republicans to rig the system and not call a special election.\"",
      "Last week, Jeffries said it was \"very likely\" Democrats would move to sue Abbott if he did not call a special election soon.",
      "Texas law doesn\u2019t appear to include a deadline for the governor to call a special election after a vacancy opens up. Special elections typically take place alongside already-scheduled elections in Texas, unless the governor deems it an emergency.",
      "In this case, Abbott determined the special election for Turner's seat would be held during the next regularly scheduled election day in November.",
      "The Turner seat will remain open for longer than other recent House vacancies in Texas. After Rep. Filemon Vela, D-Texas, resigned on March 31, 2022, Abbott called an emergency special election\u00a0for June 14 days later.",
      "And on July 19, after Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who represented the same 18th Congressional District seat in Houston as Turner, died in office, Abbott on Aug. 2 set a special election for Nov. 5 of that year.",
      "Christian Menefee, a Harris County attorney and Democrat who plans to run for the seat this year, had pushed for Abbott to immediately call a June special election.",
      "\u201cIt is unconscionable to leave nearly 800,000 people in this district without representation in Congress for most of the year,\u201d Menefee said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll go through hurricane season, budget battles, and attacks on Social Security and Medicaid with no one at the table fighting for us. Governor Abbott knows how to move quickly\u2014he\u2019s done it for other districts. He just chose not to for us.\u201d",
      "Turner, the former mayor of Houston, died on March 5, shortly after attending President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress. He was 70 years old."

      "As one Russian hockey star is being lauded for his accomplishments in the NHL, more than two dozen groups are calling on the North American league to reject the idea of on-ice matchups with the league from his homeland, Russia\u2019s\u00a0Kontinental Hockey League.",
      "The day after\u00a0Alexander Ovechkin became the top goal scorer in NHL history,\u00a0a coalition of Ukrainian-American and Ukrainian-Canadian organizations argued\u00a0that such matches \u201cwould be an affront to millions of American and Canadian NHL fans and to people of Ukrainian descent in both countries.\u201d",
      "The group urged NHL commissioner Gary Bettman in a letter Monday to\u00a0\u201cexpress prompt, public and unequivocal opposition to this suggestion.\u201d",
      "It was signed by more than 30 humanitarian and community organizations.",
      "\u201cWe call on you to reject any collaboration between the NHL and the KHL or any competition between the two league\u2019s players. Such initiatives would forever stain your organization\u2019s reputation, facilitate the broader reintegration of the Russian Federation into world sporting bodies, undermine the NHL\u2019s own stated values, and alienate millions of hockey fans,\" the letter said.",
      "The letter, first reported by NBC News, comes after a call last month\u00a0between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin,\u00a0during which\u00a0Putin suggested that American and Russian skaters play matches against one another.\u00a0According to the Kremlin, Trump \u201csupported\u201d the idea.",
      "The NHL said Monday it was \"not part of the original conversation, and there have been no further discussions.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last month that while hockey was mentioned on the leaders\u2019 call, the White House is \u201cmore interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Last month, the NHL said that it was aware of the conversation but that it was \u201cnot a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time,\u201d The Associated Press reported.",
      "Razom for Ukraine, a U.S.-based organization that co-signed and helped send the letter to the NHL, hoped for a stronger position from the league.",
      "\u201cSo the NHL has come out with a statement that most certainly did not put to rest concerns and worries,\u201d said Razom for Ukraine\u2019s director of public engagement, Daniel Balson.\u00a0\u201cOur letter simply asks for the NHL to make plain and public its opposition to any such collaboration.",
      "\u201cAs NHL and KHL players would\u00a0ostensibly\u00a0be playing together on the ice, Russian bombs would be raining fire on Ukraine civilians.\u201d",
      "The Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin has a long history of using sports to whitewash its crimes. Certainly hockey, but really across the board, Putin\u2019s interested in portraying Russia as a modern member in good standing of the international community\u00a0that wins medals and demonstrates athletic excellence,\u201d Balson said. \u201cBut of course, this is all belied by the fact that, as we\u2019re having this conversation, Russia\u2019s military are committing war crimes in Ukraine, they\u2019re occupying territory, and they\u2019re killing many, many innocent individuals, innocent civilians, including hundreds of Ukrainian athletes who lost their lives.\u201d",
      "Hours before the coalition sent the letter, Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals star, scored his 895th career goal, topping Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record.",
      "Ovechkin has long been seen as closely tied to Putin, even smiling with him in his Instagram profile picture. And Putin congratulated Ovechkin on his milestone goal.",
      "Ovechkin did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who has proudly proclaimed his affiliation with a Russian leadership that is unrepentant in its abuse of some of the most vulnerable Ukrainians in the world, that\u2019s territorially expansionist, that has launched an unprovoked and incredibly violent aggression and that has kidnapped kids. It\u2019s incumbent on somebody like Ovechkin to dissociate himself from the Kremlin,\u201d Balson said.",
      "At the time of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022,\u00a0Ovechkin told reporters: \u201cPlease, no more war. It doesn\u2019t matter who is in the war, Russia, Ukraine, different countries.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "BOYERS, Pa. \u2014 As you ride in a golf cart into the mouth of the Iron Mountain limestone mine, the temperature change is immediately noticeable. The natural climate control provided by the rough-hewn stone walls of the decommissioned mine \u2014 a day\u2019s drive from the nation's capital and about an hour outside Pittsburgh \u2014 helped make it an ideal site for the federal government to process and store retirement records beginning in 1960.",
      "Sixty-five years later, when so much is now done online, this mine is largely still how the Office of Personnel Management manages the documents of the 100,000 or so retirements from federal service each year.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Processing a retirement can take months, with a single missing signature sometimes setting the task back days or weeks.",
      "\u201cIt is still done on paper,\u201d said Alita Haniwalt, an OPM program manager in retirement claims. \u201cI think it becomes overwhelming because there are no two retirements that are the same.\u201d",
      "Over the years, the warehouse-like OPM space inside the mine \u2014 which is 220 feet underground \u2014 has accumulated more than 400 million individual records, spread across 26,000 file cabinets, in some places stacked 10 high. Cardboard boxes and paper files in manila envelopes seem to sprout from shelves and pile up on tables as they\u2019re shuttled from station to station.",
      "In the days following President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the mine quickly drew the attention of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency.\u00a0Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia, a Tesla board member and Musk friend, said he was recruited to the project after he walked into a meeting where it was already being discussed.",
      "\u201cThey were talking about how it\u2019s a place where all the papers are stored for a manual retirement process. It\u2019s been around for decades. It\u2019s been tried to be digitized for decades, unsuccessfully, and it\u2019s a painful, slow process,\u201d Gebbia said. \u201cAnd they turn and look at me and go: 'Joe, you know how to build digital products with great user experience. Can you help us?'\u201d",
      "NBC News was granted rare and exclusive access to the mine Monday, when DOGE staffers arrived to tour it and plan the next steps in modernizing the OPM operation there.",
      "In February, under the direction of DOGE, OPM staffers processed their first all-digital, no-paperwork federal retirement. The team was given a one-week goal, and it completed the retirement in two days.",
      "\u201cIt really became a proof point and a rallying cry to everyone to say this is possible. Now we get to go build the product behind that and actually do something that\u2019s scalable,\u201d Gebbia said.",
      "Matt MacIsaac, who runs day-to-day operations at the mine for OPM, said that while Musk\u2019s Oval Office invocation of his workplace as a location ripe for a DOGE overhaul initially surprised him, he supported\u00a0the modernization push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to make this process better, make it more efficient and really get what we need for the civil servants,\u201d said MacIsaac, who has worked for OPM since 2009 and in the mine since 2016."

      "Here\u2019s the latest on where the trade war stands:",
      "Trump plows ahead: Trump said he is \u201cnot looking\u201d to pause his tariffs before they go into effect Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be fair deals, and in certain cases, they\u2019re going to be paying substantial tariffs.\u201d",
      "Asked whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation \u2014 a point his advisers struggled to clarify last week \u2014 Trump insisted that \u201cthey can both be true.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere could be permanent, and there could also be negotiations, because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to get fair deals and good deals with every country.\u201d",
      "Stock market volatility: The markets ended largely lower Monday after a wild trading day. The S&P closed down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.9%, or 350 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.1%, led by a rally in chipmaker Nvidia, which finished 3.5% higher.",
      "U.S. markets whipsawed as investors grasped for any shred of news that indicated Trump would relent on his tariffs plan. A widely circulated but false headline saying he was considering a 90-day pause sent markets skyrocketing for a brief time.",
      "New threat over China: Trump threatened additional tariffs of 50% on China if it doesn\u2019t rescind its retaliatory measures of 34%. That\u2019s in addition to his announcement last week, meaning the total tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China would be as much as 104% if they were fully implemented.",

      "The view from Wall Street: Major figures in the business world have spent the last few days sounding the alarm about the economic consequences of Trump\u2019s tariff policies, with some even reversing their previous supportive stances of him.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual shareholder letter that Trump\u2019s tariffs would \u201cslow down growth\u201d as \u201cinput costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.\u201d On Friday, the bank raised its odds for a recession from 40% to 60%.",
      "Dimon\u2019s comments are a sharp reversal from those he made in January urging people to \u201cget over\u201d Trump\u2019s tariff policy because they were \u201cgood for national security.\u201d",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman said on X\u00a0that \u201cthe global economy is being taken down because of bad math,\u201d capping off a weekend of missives that called for a 90-day pause on tariff implementation and others aimed at Trump\u2019s policy team.",
      "\u201cThis is not what we voted for,\u201d wrote Ackman, who endorsed Trump during the 2024 campaign.",
      "The view from Capitol Hill: Republicans in Congress are still largely sticking by Trump through the tariff turbulence, though new cracks have continued to emerge.",
      "A bipartisan Senate bill that would limit the president\u2019s power to impose tariffs now has seven Republican co-sponsors. But the White House officially said Trump would veto the legislation if it reached his desk, meaning it would take two-thirds of the GOP-controlled House and Senate to turn it into law. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said of the bill: \u201cI don\u2019t think that has a future.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Mike Lee of Utah posted on X in favor of Trump\u2019s taking up the European Union on its offer of zero-for-zero tariffs.",
      "Over in the House, some anxious Republicans are seeking more guidance about Trump\u2019s broader plans. During a House GOP conference call over the weekend, Rep. Darrell Issa, of California, asked whether lawmakers could get a detailed briefing from the White House about Trump\u2019s tariffs. And Rep. French Hill, of Arkansas, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, expressed some frustration with how the White House has handled the tariff situation.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. John James of Michigan is running for governor, he announced Monday, as one of the most pivotal elections on the ballot in 2026 continues to draw big-name politicians.",
      "In a message posted on his social media channels, James lamented Democratic governance in the state and argued that \"it's time to get Michigan's government out of fantasyland and back to common sense.\"",
      "\"Our state has suffered long enough. Michigan is strong. Our people are strong. But we are being held back by a lack of strong, competent leadership,\" he wrote.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Ahead of a potentially crowded primary, James signaled he would run as an ally of President Donald Trump, who narrowly won the state in 2016 and 2024 and lost there in 2020.",
      "\"President Trump and I have been in each other's corner through thick and thin for eight years \u2014 no reason that will end now. He's doing his part to Make America Great Again, and I'll do mine to bring prosperity and sanity back to Michigan,\" James' statement added.",
      "Trump has not publicly weighed in on the race.",
      "James came to Washington after a successful House campaign in 2022, when he won a competitive race for an open seat. He had previously launched two unsuccessful Senate bids in the state and his recruitment to the House was a boon for Republicans who had sought to convince the Army veteran and businessman to run.",
      "If his gubernatorial bid is successful, he would be Michigan's first Black governor.",
      "Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is term-limited and cannot run again. The race to replace her has drawn a handful of prominent politicians in the state.",
      "Right now, James' top opponent is state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt. But others could run, too, like former state Attorney General Mike Cox and 2022 gubernatorial nominee Tudor Dixon, who are both exploring bids.",
      "\u201cMore and more folks from every corner of Michigan are joining our 'Michigan First' movement,\u201d Nesbitt said in a written statement that an adviser provided in response to questions about James' candidacy. \u201cWe all know Michigan families deserve far better than what they\u2019ve been getting from Lansing under Governor Whitmer.\u201d",
      "Two statewide Democratic officeholders are also running in what's expected to be a high-profile primary on that side of the aisle as well. Both Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson have announced gubernatorial bids. Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson\u00a0is also running.",
      "While James is casting his candidacy as running against Democratic politicians in the state, Gilchrist and Benson are leaning heavily on their experiences in statewide office and the accomplishments of the party, which won every major statewide office in the 2018 election and again in 2022, and held control of both legislative chambers through 2024.",
      "The winner of the two party primaries will have to deal with an interesting wrinkle: Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is running as an independent and not in the Democratic primary \u2014 the party he'd previously affiliated with.",
      "James\u2019 decision opens up a potentially competitive House seat in the southeastern corner of the state, one that Democrats and Republicans have fought furiously over in recent elections."

      "Monday\u2019s ruling \u2014 by the same court where a seat is at stake in the case \u2014 temporarily blocks a decision from Friday by the North Carolina Court of Appeals.",
      "In that ruling, a Republican-majority three-judge panel gave the North Carolina State Board of Elections 15 business days to obtain the necessary proof of identity, for the thousands of voters whose eligibility was challenged by Griffin\u2019s campaign and its lawyers, that would verify those votes. In its decision, the court ruled that any voters who don\u2019t respond would not have their vote counted.",
      "The brief order Monday did not say whether the Supreme Court was going to review Griffin\u2019s entire case or only Riggs\u2019 appeal, which had sought a halt to Friday\u2019s appeals court ruling.",
      "Republicans currently have a 5-2 majority on the North Carolina Supreme Court. Riggs has recused herself from the matter.",
      "Griffin sits on the state appeals court but recused himself from the case."

      "While some details have been changed, the eight-episode series is closely based on the real story of Kochan, and on the podcast of the same name she hosted with her best friend, Nikki Boyer.",
      "In the show, Kochan leaves her husband of 13 years, Steve (Jay Duplass) to focus on her sexual reawakening following a likely terminal cancer diagnosis.",
      "The real Kochan opened up about her decision to end her marriage in a 2016 blog post titled simply, \u201cI Left My Husband Today.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe truth is, without this diagnosis I probably would have stayed, continued to try to make things work. Because there is a lot of love there,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut there is also a lot of stress. And a stressful environment is not a good one when battling cancer.\u201d",
      "She added that facing the fleetingness of life compelled her to \u201cnurture self expression that I couldn\u2019t find in the context of my marriage\u201d and to \u201cstop second guessing that voice that has been telling me I\u2019m unhappy.\u201d",
      "The identity of Kochan\u2019s real-life husband has been kept private.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably struggling with parts of the story that didn\u2019t feel they matched up with what he had experienced,\u201d Boyer, who served as an executive producer on the FX show, said in a recent interview with The Times. \u201cI care for him. I wish him so much love.\u201d",
      "After leaving her marriage, Kochan had liaisons with dozens of men, losing count at 183, according to Boyer.",
      "\u201cShe would always say sex felt like the antithesis to death. Being physically on fire made her feel alive,\u201d Boyer said.",
      "Kochan opened up about her sexual journey in her blog, \u201cEverything Leads to This,\u201d explaining her desire to connect with her body while facing her mortality.",
      "\u201cIn my experience, many people in the \u2018death world\u2019 don\u2019t talk about sex. Possibly for many reasons ranging from embarrassment to body denial,\u201d she wrote. \u201cScars, medication side effects, lack of information from doctors, all of these things make it challenging to want to connect to the body sexually. But being touched and finding intimacy through a diagnosis similar to mine can be powerful and vital.\u201d",
      "As part of her self expression, Kochan shared racy photos of herself on Instagram, which she described in her bio as \u201cthe sexy selfies I send to strangers to feel alive.\u201d",
      "The revealing photos are overlaid with statements about cancer and death, such as, \u201cThe temporary nature of things is both beautiful and terrifying\u201d and, \u201cOften when I buy skincare products, I wonder if I\u2019ll be around to finish them.\u201d",
      "Michelle Williams says she was moved by Kochan\u2019s fearlessness as she portrayed her in the series.",
      "\u201cThe real Molly continued to find ways to explore her sexuality, to feel good about her body even when she was right toward the end of her life,\u201d Williams told Vanity Fair. \u201cShe loved to get beautiful lingerie and would take these really gorgeous pictures of herself, but they would be creatively disguising chemo scars or where her chemo port was. She found ways to continue to love herself.\u201d",
      "Jenny Slate, who played Boyer in the series, told TODAY.com she felt a \"great responsibility\" to tell the story sensitively and honor Kochan.",
      "Slate recalled one spring day during shooting when she saw an tree covered in pink blossoms.",
      "\"I just felt so strongly a connection to Molly in that moment,\" she told TODAY.com. \"That beautiful blooming. And it was like watching something blush. It was so beautiful. And I remember thinking, 'I will really, really try to do my best by you.'\"",
      "While Kochan did not get the chance to see the TV series come to life, Boyer says her friend would have been thrilled to see Williams portray her on screen.",
      "\u201cHollywood legend, choosy about her projects, artistic, private,\u201d Boyer said of the actor in her Times interview. \u201cMolly would have been, \u2018Yes, thank you.\u2019\u201d",
      "What happened to Molly Kochan?Kochan died in 2019 at age 45.",
      "She pre-wrote a blog post announcing her own death, which was published on March 8 of that year.",
      "\u201cI have died. I no longer walk the earth like you. In a body, that is a blessing when it works, and, when it stops working, I assure you the dropping of it is an equal blessing,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all I can tell you about where I\u2019m not,\u201d she continued. \u201cAs I write this, I know what everyone knows, but most don\u2019t believe for themselves: mortality is real for us all.\u201d",
      "Boyer recalled her last moments with Kochan in her recent interview with The Times, saying she was sitting with Kochan in the hospital when she passed away.",
      "\u201cI woke with just enough time for her last two breaths. I put my hand on her head and my other hand on her heart. I said, \u2018I\u2019m here, I\u2019ve got you.\u2019 I was in awe of her in that moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was one of the most magical things I\u2019ve ever experienced. It was so intense and beautiful.\u201d",
      "Boyer produced their six-episode podcast, \u201cDying for Sex,\u201d following her friend\u2019s death, which she said \u201cdelayed some of my grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause I was still working with her voice,\u201d she told The Times. \u201cI felt she was guiding me.\u201d"

      "Thompson said he wanted to find a \u201cserious kind of solution\u201d for his issue and was eventually prescribed medication by his doctor to address it.",
      "Thompson is now a spokesperson for Phathom Pharmaceuticals and appeared on TODAY to talk about finding a medication that's finally given him relief. \"I was suffering from, you know, pretty intense like acid reflux and heartburn and stuff like that. I ended up being diagnosed with GERD,\" Thompson said on April 7.",
      "\"I was given a prescription that worked for me, and, you know, (I'm) trying to spread the message, basically, because it is a very uncomfortable situation. I just want people to get the help that they need if they need it.\"",
      "The Mayo Clinic reports that most people can manage GERD symptoms with lifestyle adjustments and medication. In some rare cases, however, surgery is required.",
      "During his interview with Entertainment Weekly, Thompson, who has been on \u201cSNL\u201d for 22 seasons, answered the question that's been on fans' minds since he broke the\u00a0record for the longest-tenured cast\u00a0member: Has he considered leaving the show?",
      "\u201cIt would be cool if I never left the show,\" Thompson said. \"That\u2019d be crazy.\u201d",
      "The comedian joined \u201cSNL\u201d in 2003 at 25 and currently holds the record for longest-standing cast member, surpassing Darrell Hammond\u2019s previously held record of 14 seasons.",
      "Along with performing as part of the \u201cSNL\u201d 50th anniversary special this year, the show has catapulted Thompson into stardom. He\u2019s been nominated six times for Emmy Awards for his work on the show. Thompson has appeared in several films and television shows, including starring in \u201cKenan,\u201d his own sitcom on NBC.",
      "\u201cI guess the only other milestone would be just to be the forever cast member. Just never leave the show,\u201d he said. \u201cThirty (seasons) is like, okay, that\u2019s just another number kind of thing. Twenty was just such a thing that nobody had ever done. People had gotten into their teens before, but nobody had gotten all the way up to 20. And then I was close to doing it.\"",
      "He continued, \u201cOnce I started getting into 17, I was like, \u2018Well, if I can, I would love to stick around till 20.\u2019 And now here we are at 22, so I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d fans have long speculated on whether the show\u2019s creator, Lorne Michaels, has plans to soon retire. When asked, Thompson provided his own intel \u2014 or lack thereof.",
      "\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Thompson said of Michael\u2019s potential retirement. \u201cI feel like we\u2019ll both just ride until the wheels fall off.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\"The Handmaid's Tale\" is returning for its sixth and final season on April 8. Before then, catch up on what happened in Season 5.",
      "Over five seasons and 53 episodes (so far), \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu) viewers have watched June (Elisabeth Moss) endure nearly every kind of violence and degradation possible.",
      "She\u2019s escaped an oppressive, misogynist theocracy, gotten some limited revenge, become a reluctant \u2014 if furious \u2014 leader of others like her and seen her newly-adopted Canadian home start to succumb to the tentacles of the theocracy that transformed the United States into Gilead.",
      "When Season 5 wrapped in 2022, June was last seen on a refugee train with daughter Nichole and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 her nemesis Serena (Yvonne Strahovski), who was toting her own newborn. (These two women just can\u2019t seem to quit one another.) All were headed into an uncertain future in which, at least for a time, maybe the enemy of her enemy might be her friend.",
      "June has now been an ex-handmaid nearly as long as she was in captivity. Here's a look back at the journey Season 5 took us on \u2014 and Serena and June both ended up on that train.",
      "Fred\u2019s dead. Can June live again?",
      "At the end of Season 4, June and her fellow compatriots lured her former commander/rapist Fred Waterford (Joseph Fiennes) into a forest, where they beat him to death. June cut off his finger and made sure it got delivered to Serena.",
      "As Season 5 opened, June was trying to deal with the effects of helping to beat a man to death, then attempting to settle back into life as wife, mother and refugee.",
      "But the respite was very brief. Though June was surrounded by loved ones \u2014 including husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and best friend Moira (Samira Wiley) \u2014 she remained haunted by her past life, and the fact that her daughter (with Luke; Nichole\u2019s dad is Nick, played by Max Minghella) Hannah remained in the Gilead system.",
      "She worried she might be hunted by the theocracy\u2019s representatives for extradition and retribution, and that Serena, given freedom to preach her gospel, could win over Canadians. Both women got chances during the season to shoot one another, and never did.",
      "Unable to live properly without getting Hannah out of Gilead, June and Luke traveled to No Man\u2019s Land between Canada and Gilead to learn where she was, but ended up being captured by Gilead sympathizers. They\u2019re separated (again!) and are unsuccessful in liberating their daughter.",
      "Toward the end of the season, June and Luke were again reunited, but violent Gilead supporters and anti-refugee protesters started going after June and other refugees. June dodged bullets but not a truck, and was mowed down, her arm broken. Luke caught the driver and beat him up \u2014 and the driver eventually died.",
      "The couple realized that Canada was no longer a safe haven, so with help from US-in-exile representative Mark Tuello (Sam Jager), they head for a train that would take them to Alaska. The police arrested Luke on the platform, and June and Nichole were the only ones able to board the train, though.",
      "Serena turned into a symbol",
      "Most of Season 5 found Serena pregnant and struggling to redefine herself. Instead, she became a symbol in both Gilead and Canada \u2014 and for a time, got a taste of what it was like to be treated as a kind of handmaid.",
      "With her husband dead, she insisted on bringing his body back to Gilead for a state funeral, which was broadcast internationally. Gilead leaders didn\u2019t know what to do with a powerful, pregnant widow, so they made her an unofficial global ambassador for Gilead and more or less washed their hands of her. Meanwhile, devout followers in Canada began to flock to Serena.",
      "Released from detention, Serena was taken in by Canadian Gilead believers, Alanis\u00a0(Genevieve Angelson) and Ryan (Lucas Neff)\u00a0Wheeler.",
      "Serena decided to focus less on Gilead\u2019s political needs and more on women\u2019s fertility issues. But as her pregnancy advanced, The Wheelers started to exert more control: She had to get remarried; no single mothers were allowed in their world.",
      "When Serena learned that June and Luke were detained in No Man\u2019s Land, she journeyed with the hit man tasked with killing June. Given the chance to shoot June herself, Serena shot Ezra and the two women went on the run \u2014 just as Serena went into labor.",
      "Serena gave birth to Noah with June\u2019s help, but the delivery made her sick and she returned to Canada \u2014 where Noah was given to the Wheelers.",
      "As her health improved, she was treated almost like a handmaid in the house, useful only for nursing her own baby. But given a free window, she fled the Wheelers with Noah and boarded the same train as June \u2014 both women on the run yet again, with their children.",
      "What about everyone else?",
      "A lot of time in Season 5 was spent on flashbacks, including how June came to be the Waterfords\u2019 Handmaid, along with other backstory. The side characters in Season 5 largely hovered around June and Serena\u2019s story, but here\u2019s what we learned about a few others:",
      "Emily (Alexis Bledel) left her wife and son and headed back to Gilead. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) continued to train future Handmaids, but was rebuffed when she tried to reform the system (expect her character to be set up this season for the \"Handmaid's\" sequel, \"The Testaments,\" which is set to go into production next week).  Janine (Madeline Brewer) was briefly posted with The Putnams, but after an act of rebellion was sent back to the Red Center to work with Aunt Lydia, then got dragged away by security to an unknown fate. (All the way to the set of Netflix's \"You,\" maybe, where she's a major player in that series' final season.) Nick got married and his wife became pregnant, which which shifted his alliances \u2014 though he still had feelings for June.",

    "summary": "The viral TikTok series called Group Chat is taking over the internet. The series' creator Sydney Robinson talks the inspiration for the video, working with Charlie Puth and what's next.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney Robinson is the showrunner, director, writer, cinematographer and star of the internet\u2019s new favorite show: a series of TikToks about a girls\u2019 group chat.",
      "The first video, which Robinson, 27, posted March 30, introduces viewers to a set of roommates whose group text chain starts to blow up when another friend makes a controversial move: inviting her boyfriend to that night's dinner reservation.",
      "What ensues is a series of passive aggressive remarks and verbal spars exchanged between the group chat's members.",
      "Online, viewers can't get enough of the drama.",
      "As of Sunday, April 6, the original \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video has more than 25 million views, 3 million likes and nearly 20,000 comments. Celebrities like Stassi Schroeder and Bethenny Frankel have posted their own videos weighing in on the drama, while Leslie Jones, Hailey Bieber and Charlie Puth (more on that later) have commented that they\u2019re hooked on the plot\u2019s twists and turns.",
      "\u201cEvery single brand that I could name\u201d has started commenting on the posts, Robinson tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cEverybody quiet \u2026 my show is on,\u201d the TikTok account for UPS said.",
      "\u201cthis is our super bowl,\u201d Ashley Furniture added.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been gaining around 100,000 (followers) every day, steady,\u201d Robinson says.",
      "The TikToker, who has been posting content on the app since around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly about popular TV shows, says before posting the first \u201cGroup Chat\u201d video she was \u201cstuck\u201d at around 260,000 followers.",
      "She hit one million on Saturday, April 5.",
      "The inspiration",
      "Robinson says she's been trying to write the \u201cGroup Chat\u201d series for about a year.",
      "It all started when she was watching an episode of \u201cJersey Shore: Family Vacation\u201d while flying to Las Vegas in the summer of 2024.",
      "In the episode, Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino\u00a0gets released from jail and alerts the rest of the cast via their group chat.",
      "\u201cHe texts everyone that he\u2019s out, and they\u2019re all on a vacation in a house sleeping, and it just revives the group chat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cIt revives the entire group. Everyone\u2019s like, waking up, looking at it, and just the very idea of his name popping up on their home screen sent shock waves through the house.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018That. That feeling,\u2019\u201d she adds of what she wants to capture in her TikTok series.",
      "The storyline so far involves one friend nearly hijacking her friends\u2019 dinner by inviting her boyfriend, Justin, named for an inside joke among her friends.",
      "The girl, Hailey (named after the character from \u201cOne Tree Hill,\u201d not Hailey and Justin Bieber, Robinson notes), insists Justin had \u201csuch a rough day\u201d and she doesn\u2019t \u201cwant to leave him alone.\u201d The rest of the girls in the group chat try to shut it down.",
      "Robinson says the story does draw from some of her own experiences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny the ways in which being a woman is such a universal experience,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think having a really close group of girlfriends with very different personalities that are bound to clash, but it doesn\u2019t always mean the end of a friendship.\u201d",
      "After the series started to go viral, she says people started to text her asking, \u201cIs this about this person?\u201d or, \u201cIs this about that story I told you?\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018No,\u2019 but that\u2019s how universal it is, that everybody lowkey thinks I\u2019m like, subtweeting them, and I\u2019m not,\u201d she says.",
      "Tensions escalate in Part 2 as Hailey leaves the group chat, while the rest of the girls find out the original reservation included Justin in the tally all along.",
      "Then in Part 3, Hailey asks to rejoin the group and confirms she'll join them for dinner sans Justin \u2014\u00a0only for the rest of the girls to find him already at the restaurant, sparking confusion from nearly all parties.",
      "Robinson posted Part 4 of the series, which saw the aftermath of the group\u2019s arrival at the restaurant, on April 5. And for the first time, one of the characters wasn\u2019t played by Robinson.",
      "Instead one of the series\u2019 biggest fans lent his voice to the role of the elusive boyfriend \u2014 Puth.",
      "Yes, that character was voiced by Charlie Puth",
      "After posting Part 2 of her series, Robinson says she took a nap. Meanwhile, her mom, who has been on vacation out of the country, started calling.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s calling me like 100 times, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Charlie Puth commented on your video,\u2019\u201d Robinson recalls. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018No, shut up.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so invested in this\u2026,\u201d Puth commented.",
      "After, they ended up messaging, and she outright asked if he'd be the voice actor for the Justin character. She says she was \"so surprised\" he agreed.",
      "\u201cI have no idea why this massive man in the music industry with 22 million followers would want to be a part of my \u2018Group Chat\u2019 skit,\u201d she says.",
      "The goal was to create a bit of mystery by not revealing the voice actor. But within 10 minutes of the video going live, Robinson says she noticed comments like, \u201cWait, is that Charlie Puth?\u201d She says one TikTok user even made a video comparing clips of Puth talking with the voice of Justin to confirm they\u2019re the same.",
      "Once people caught on, Puth confirmed his involvement by commenting, \u201cWhy does Justin\u2019s voice sound familiar \u2026\u201d",
      "Asked if this guest role will turn into a regular gig, Robinson says the goal was to write Justin into just one episode.",
      "\u201cObviously if he ever wanted to be involved ... of course he\u2019s got the part, no question,\u201d she says.",
      "Plus, there might be more special guests to look out for.",
      "\u201cAt this point, it seems like Charlie Puth might not be the last guest star for \u2018Group Chat.\u2019 There might be some more to come,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cHopefully I can keep writing this forever, and hopefully there\u2019s just a bunch of fun surprises in store.\u201d",
      "What's next?",
      "Right now, fans are left on a cliffhanger, with Part 4 revealing that Justin had separate plans at that restaurant with another woman, who calls him, \u201cbabe,\u201d in the final seconds of the skit, implying Hailey might have been trying to catch Justin cheating on her.",
      "Going forward, Robinson hints that there will be a bit of a \u201credemption arc\u201d for Hailey.",
      "There\u2019s one more video planned for the story of this fateful girls\u2019 night out dinner, Robinson says.",
      "\u201cWe are going to kind of get an answer about what\u2019s been going on,\u201d Robinson promises.",
      "But she emphasizes, \u201cJust because the dinner segment has ended, doesn\u2019t mean the group chat is done.\u201d",
      "In fact, she says she already has storylines planned for situations like, \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and \u201cThe Birthday.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are keeping the same characters,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to change the scenario. And it might not always be Hailey. Because everyone has their annoying qualities.\u201d",
      "And fans shouldn\u2019t have too long to wait. After \u201cThe Dinner\u201d storyline has wrapped, Robinson says she\u2019ll probably dive right back in.",
      "\u201cTikTok does not allow me the time to take a beat,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cPeople are finding my Venmo and requesting like one cent, but being like, 'What I\u2019m actually requesting is Part 4.'\u201d"

      "The sketch was chock full of opportunities for Black and Yang to try to one-up the group, and each other. When Sherman complimented Black\u2019s sweater, he said he thrifted it from Goodwill where he is a volunteer, earning a rare triple bird screech that had several cast members breaking on camera, including Sherman.",

Chelsea, back at the resort, attends Chloe (Charlotte Le Bon) and Greg's (Jon Gries) dinner party.

Once again, confronted with the option of sharing what's happening with his family, Timothy chooses to hide the truth, insisting that everything is fine.",

      "Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) and Mook (Lalisa Manobal) are at the fight together. Gaitok tells Mook he won't be getting the promotion as he doesn't have the \"killer instinct\" needed. Mook encourages him to grasp it, claiming that violence is human nature. Then, Gaitok catches sight of Vlad and recognizes him from the robbery. Noticing that Vlad is friends with Valentin and Aleksei, Gaitok puts it together that Valentin had stalled him on purpose so they could rob the resort.",
      "That night, Laurie goes home with Aleksei and the two sleep together. Afterwards, Aleksei asks Laurie for $10,000 to help bring his mother over to Thailand from Russia. Laurie says no and sneaks out as a girl bursts into Aleksei's room looking for proof of him cheating. On her way out, Laurie sees the stolen jewelry.",

      "It has been one week since Morgan Wallen broke tradition and abruptly left the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d stage during the show's sign off, and the late-night sketch comedy show had some thoughts.",
      "Jack Black returned to Studio 8H to host \u201cSNL\u201d for the fourth time on Saturday, April 5, alongside musical guests Elton John and Brandi Carlile.",
      "The week prior, Mikey Madison made her hosting debut fresh off of her win at the Oscars, while Wallen returned as musical guest for the second time. In a puzzling moment at the end of the show, Wallen left the \u201cSNL\u201d stage early, rather than mingling with Madison and the rest of the cast.",
      "His exit became the punchline of a joke told during the \u201cWeekend Update\u201d segment by co-anchor Colin Jost, while he talked about the economy and the recent stock market plunges.",
      "\u201cJust in the past two days, investors have lost over $6 trillion,\u201d Jost said. \u201cMoney is leaving the stock market faster than Morgan Wallen at goodnights.\u201d",
      "Wallen was also referenced earlier in the show during the cold open, which featured a sketch about President Donald Trump\u2019s recent tariffs. These included 10% tariffs placed on Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which are located in the Antarctic Ocean and are mostly populated by penguins.",
      "\u201cYou know, no country is safe from my tariffs. I even put tariffs on an island that is uninhabited by humans,\u201d cast member James Austin Johnson said in his Trump impression. \u201cIt\u2019s called Heard and McDonald Island. Ooh, McDonald Island. I\u2019d love to visit there, right?\u201d",
      "Johnson had some mockup artwork made of \u201cMcDonald Island,\u201d which featured a Big Mac wearing a grass skirt on a beach surrounded by chicken nuggets which were drawn up with arms, legs, eyes and a mouth, and palm trees with French fries as fronds.",
      "\u201cI want to go to there,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country, right?\u201d",
      "Johnson referred to the Instagram story that Wallen shared after his abrupt exit from the \u201cSNL\u201d stage. In the early hours of Sunday morning following the show, he posted a photo from inside of an airplane on the tarmac and simply wrote, \u201cGet me to God\u2019s country.\u201d",
      "Days later, Morgan even began selling merchandise with the saying on it, including a baseball hat and t-shirt.",
      "Kenan Thompson discussed the incident during a recent interview, expressing his confusion over the event. He told Entertainment Weekly, \u201cI don\u2019t know what goes through people\u2019s minds when they decide to do stuff like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if he understood the assignment or not, or if he was really feeling a certain kind of way,\u201d Thompson added. \u201cYou see somebody before you get a chance to say hi or say good job or anything like that, they just dipping.\u201d",
      "Thompson said that he \u201cthought maybe he had to go to the potty or something\u201d and commented that \u201cit\u2019s definitely a spike in the norm.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so used to everybody just turning around and high-fiving us, everybody\u2019s saying, \u2018Good job, good job, good job,\u2019\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo when there\u2019s a departure from that, it\u2019s like, \u2018Hmm, I wonder what that\u2019s about?\u2019\u201d"

    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 It\u2019s a well-established routine.",
      "Every day, Zeev Engelmayer takes a seat at his bay window overlooking his backyard in central Tel Aviv. His mission? Fighting despair with an army of colorful markers in a bid to bring hope to the people of Israel.",
      "For the past 18 months since the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, he has drawn a daily postcard, many featuring Israeli hostages. Some have been turned into banners, T-shirts and profile pictures on social media and have been embraced by the families of those taken captive. One even made its way to Pope Francis.",
      "Although the subject matter is often dark, the postcards are for the most part colorful and innocent. \u201cI use a child\u2019s style because a child has the ability to have hope even in times that are very difficult,\u201d he told NBC News in February.",
      "In the first two weeks after the Hamas attacks, Engelmayer said he drew in black and white to reflect the deep sadness he felt about the attacks on Israel, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. He said his first piece paid homage to \u201cGuernica,\u201d the 1937 anti-war masterpiece by renowned Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.",
      "But then one morning he said he picked up colored pens and began to draw.",
      "Titled \u201cSomething Terrible Is About to Happen,\u201d the picture he produced that day depicted Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, a small community in southern Israel where dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed on the morning of the Hamas attack and more than 30 residents were also taken hostage.",
      "\u201cI wanted to show the difference between what was before, this peaceful place, and the green trees and the flowers,\u201d Engelmayer said. \u201cI wanted to show the moments before it happened.\u201d",
      "The first postcard he drew of a hostage, he added, was of grandmother Yaffa Adar, now 86, who was filmed as she was taken away in a golf cart from her home in nearby Kibbutz Nir Oz while surrounded by armed militants.",
      "\u201cShe had a little smile,\u201d said Engelmayer, adding that she held her head up high so as not to give her captors \u201cthe satisfaction of taking her hostage.\u201d",
      "Instead of drawing her capture, he said he imagined her happy return home. \u201cI drew her surrounded by a woman with colorful dresses, spreading flowers in the air,\u201d he said of Adar, who was freed four days later, on Nov. 24, 2023, after 49 days in captivity.",
      "Engelmayer said after that he was approached by relatives of many hostages asking him to depict their loved ones. They told him all about their hobbies and passions, as well as personal anecdotes, in the hope of inspiring him.",
      "One also made it to Pope Francis via an Italian diplomat, Engelmayer said, adding that the pontiff then \u201cprayed for the hostages.\u201d",
      "Throughout, Engelmayer said he was determined to highlight the plight of those in Hamas captivity, although many have since been freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as part of a ceasefire deal earlier this year and during a previous pause in fighting in November 2023.",
      "After Phase 1 of what was to be a three-stage ceasefire deal, Israel last month stepped up attacks in Gaza, where it has killed more than 50,500 people since the Oct. 7 attacks, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Some days, Engelmayer said he struggled to \u201cfind the optimism.\u201d In September 2024, when American Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin\u2019s body was found shot execution style, alongside five other hostages, he said he \u201cdrew a very pessimistic, difficult painting.\u201d",
      "A picture of Kfir Bibas, who was just 9 months old when he was kidnapped with his brother Ariel, 4, and their mother, Shiri, 34. The postcard depicted the ginger-haired baby celebrating his first birthday alongside his captors, with a cake, balloons and decorations. It \u201clooks as though it\u2019s a happy drawing, but it\u2019s a very sad drawing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the saddest happy birthday I made,\u201d Engelmayer added.",
      "The remains of the Bibas boys and their mom were later returned from Gaza by Hamas. Their father, Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on Feb. 1. He had no idea about their fate until he was freed.",
      "Other postcards have proved more positive, the dreams of reunions having come true. When Emily Damari, 26, was released, she held up her left hand, two of her middle fingers missing after she was shot when taken hostage from Kibbutz Kfar Aza in southern Israel.",
      "Inspired by her defiant gesture, Engelmayer said he drew her hand \u201clike a tree, with leaves around and flowers.\u201d His message? That \u201cwe can grow from this and heal from this.\u201d",
      "Some of the hostages he\u2019s depicted have reached out to thank him for his work, including Rimon Kirsht-Buchshtab, who used his drawing of her on her social media profiles.",
      "Fifty-nine hostages remain in Gaza, of which just around two dozen are believed to still be alive, including Israeli American Edan Alexander, and Engelmayer said he would not stop drawing the postcards until all had been returned.",
      "\u201cThis is the most important project I ever did,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s my mission.\u201d"

      "As one Russian hockey star is being lauded for his accomplishments in the NHL, more than two dozen groups are calling on the North American league to reject the idea of on-ice matchups with the league from his homeland, Russia\u2019s\u00a0Kontinental Hockey League.",
      "The day after\u00a0Alexander Ovechkin became the top goal scorer in NHL history,\u00a0a coalition of Ukrainian-American and Ukrainian-Canadian organizations argued\u00a0that such matches \u201cwould be an affront to millions of American and Canadian NHL fans and to people of Ukrainian descent in both countries.\u201d",
      "The group urged NHL commissioner Gary Bettman in a letter Monday to\u00a0\u201cexpress prompt, public and unequivocal opposition to this suggestion.\u201d",
      "It was signed by more than 30 humanitarian and community organizations.",
      "\u201cWe call on you to reject any collaboration between the NHL and the KHL or any competition between the two league\u2019s players. Such initiatives would forever stain your organization\u2019s reputation, facilitate the broader reintegration of the Russian Federation into world sporting bodies, undermine the NHL\u2019s own stated values, and alienate millions of hockey fans,\" the letter said.",
      "The letter, first reported by NBC News, comes after a call last month\u00a0between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin,\u00a0during which\u00a0Putin suggested that American and Russian skaters play matches against one another.\u00a0According to the Kremlin, Trump \u201csupported\u201d the idea.",
      "The NHL said Monday it was \"not part of the original conversation, and there have been no further discussions.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last month that while hockey was mentioned on the leaders\u2019 call, the White House is \u201cmore interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Last month, the NHL said that it was aware of the conversation but that it was \u201cnot a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time,\u201d The Associated Press reported.",
      "Razom for Ukraine, a U.S.-based organization that co-signed and helped send the letter to the NHL, hoped for a stronger position from the league.",
      "\u201cSo the NHL has come out with a statement that most certainly did not put to rest concerns and worries,\u201d said Razom for Ukraine\u2019s director of public engagement, Daniel Balson.\u00a0\u201cOur letter simply asks for the NHL to make plain and public its opposition to any such collaboration.",
      "\u201cAs NHL and KHL players would\u00a0ostensibly\u00a0be playing together on the ice, Russian bombs would be raining fire on Ukraine civilians.\u201d",
      "The Russian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "\u201cThe Kremlin has a long history of using sports to whitewash its crimes. Certainly hockey, but really across the board, Putin\u2019s interested in portraying Russia as a modern member in good standing of the international community\u00a0that wins medals and demonstrates athletic excellence,\u201d Balson said. \u201cBut of course, this is all belied by the fact that, as we\u2019re having this conversation, Russia\u2019s military are committing war crimes in Ukraine, they\u2019re occupying territory, and they\u2019re killing many, many innocent individuals, innocent civilians, including hundreds of Ukrainian athletes who lost their lives.\u201d",
      "Hours before the coalition sent the letter, Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals star, scored his 895th career goal, topping Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record.",
      "Ovechkin has long been seen as closely tied to Putin, even smiling with him in his Instagram profile picture. And Putin congratulated Ovechkin on his milestone goal.",
      "Ovechkin did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who has proudly proclaimed his affiliation with a Russian leadership that is unrepentant in its abuse of some of the most vulnerable Ukrainians in the world, that\u2019s territorially expansionist, that has launched an unprovoked and incredibly violent aggression and that has kidnapped kids. It\u2019s incumbent on somebody like Ovechkin to dissociate himself from the Kremlin,\u201d Balson said.",
      "At the time of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022,\u00a0Ovechkin told reporters: \u201cPlease, no more war. It doesn\u2019t matter who is in the war, Russia, Ukraine, different countries.\u201d"

      "The S&P closed down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.9%, or 350 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.1%, led by a rally in chipmaker Nvidia, which finished 3.5% higher.",

      "\"Tariffs will make this country very rich,\" he insisted.",
      "Yet Trump's quest to bring other nations to heel is drawing increasing criticism and raising questions over just how far down the White House would be willing to let the markets free-fall. The tumble last week wiped out $6.6 trillion.",
      "Commodities prices fell further overall, with oil closing at $61 a barrel. Copper prices, often an indicator for industrial demand, fell, too.",
      "The convulsions in financial markets have been a response not to the imposition of tariffs \u2014 most presidential administrations have enacted them in one form or another \u2014 but rather to the scale of what the Trump administration has proposed and the inconsistent messaging surrounding it."

    "story": [
      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\u201d began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "A vow to change Mexican music",
      "Barron\u2019s military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government\u2019s initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Singing through social issues",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Weapons and barbed wire as inspiration",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n\u2019s music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy-duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n\u2019s songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were canceled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\u201cSadly, we\u2019ve been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\u201d he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 International markets are in free fall, American allies are rattled and analysts warn that globalization as the world knows it may be crumbling.",
      "President Donald Trump has since his first term been unafraid of treating America\u2019s friends more like its adversaries. But his worldwide tariffs have the potential to reshape the global economy, and with it the lives and financial health of billions of people.",
      "In this new, topsy-turvy world order, the United States has applied the same 10% baseline tariff to its transatlantic partner the United Kingdom as it has to the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan. The European Union, meanwhile, has a higher rate than North Korea.",
      "E.U. foreign ministers were meeting Monday in Luxembourg to discuss their response. Though some inside the bloc, such as Italy, favor de-escalation, other influential figures want retaliation.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is lobbying for a full freeze on European investment in the U.S., and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has already vowed retaliatory countermeasures for the \"spiral\" of chaos.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether this is Trump\u2019s actual trade policy or merely a hostile negotiating tactic. But after a weekend in which he doubled down rather than backing down, stock indexes tumbled early Monday in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.",
      "\u201cThis is possibly one of the most significant moves in trade policy that we\u2019ve seen in a long time \u2014 maybe even generation,\u201d said Pranesh Narayanan, a research fellow at the Institute for Public Policy Research, a London think tank.",
      "He says it\u2019s no exaggeration to talk about the end of globalization as the world knows it. The international system of manufacturing and trade has, since the early 20th century, seen the U.S. become the world\u2019s dominant superpower.",
      "\u201cThere is going to be an enormous impact on the global economy. Companies will ask: \u2018Can I still do business in the U.S.?\u2019\u201d Narayanan said. \u201cThe decisions they make off the back of that are going to reshape global trade.\u201d",
      "The U.S. is not only the world's largest economy \u2014 its gross domestic product is worth $27 trillion \u2014 but the dollar serves as the backbone of international trade and is used in around 90% of foreign exchange transactions. American interests have landscaped the entire topography of global trade, with the U.S. government at the forefront of shaping postwar institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.",
      "Trade and markets aside, most economists agree that the upshot will be simple: higher everyday prices, including for Americans. Trump's tariffs \u2014 and the inevitable response \u2014 will mean companies will be paying more to produce and distribute goods and services. Such price hikes are frequently handed onto consumers.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs may be effective in achieving one thing: making the U.S. less investable, eroding its soft power, and reducing financial flows into the U.S.,\u201d Thiemo Fetzer, an economics professor at England\u2019s University of Warwick, told NBC News in an email.",
      "\u201cThis will lead to a devaluation of the dollar that will just increase the economic pain for U.S. consumers,\u201d he added, given that a lower value currency makes foreign products more expensive.",
      "Some within Trump\u2019s camp have suggested this is all a hardball negotiating strategy.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be the last country that tries to negotiate a trade deal with @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Eric Trump, one of Trump\u2019s sons, wrote on X last week. \u201cThe first to negotiate will win \u2014 the last will absolutely lose.\u201d",
      "But the president has poured cold water on this, posting on Truth Social on Friday that his policies would \u201cnever change.\u201d He told reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday that it was necessary to \u201ctake medicine\u201d to fix what he sees as a trade imbalance.",
      "NBC News has contacted the White House for comment on the widespread criticisms and fallout.",
      "Such a wide use of import taxes should be no surprise for a president who once described himself as \u201cTariff Man.\u201d His first-term tariffs principally targeted China, and were upheld by his successor, Joe Biden.",
      "This time, however, Trump has imposed a blanket 10% tariff on almost every country \u2014 including penguin-inhabited islands \u2014 while skipping Russia and North Korea. Meanwhile, the E.U. faces a 20% tariff and China of up to 54%.",
      "Beijing was swift to retaliate with its own 34% levy, escalating a trade war the cost of which will ultimately land at the feet of consumers.",
      "Others are less sure of how to respond.",
      "There has been consternation and even mockery in the U.K., where Prime Minister Keir Starmer had bent over backward lavishing Trump with praise only to find himself punished like everyone else.",
      "Some financial analysts have argued in recent days that Trump risks a return to the 1930s, when Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in an attempt to boost revenue and halt the Great Depression. Despite Trump\u2019s claim that a lack of tariffs caused the depression, economists say the 1930 act deepened the rout.",
      "Aur\u00e9lien Saussay, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics, says one must go even further into history, to 1900, to find precedent for Trump\u2019s moves.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. was a very different country; it was an emerging country catching up to industrialized nations like France and Germany,\u201d he added, describing the current policies as \u201cabsurd.\u201d",
      "While the U.S. may have led globalization in the 1990s, the world is too interconnected for Trump to undo a complex web of global trade alone, he said.",
      "Even without Washington's participation, Saussay said, \u201cyou would still have globalization working in a very similar fashion as it used to \u2014 just without the U.S.\u201d"

      "Thousands of supporters gathered at Place Vauban, near the golden dome of Les Invalides and the tomb of Napoleon, for what was billed as a protest \u2014 but observers said it had all the markings of a campaign rally.",
      "The National Rally, Le Pen\u2019s party, organized the event in response to what it calls a politically motivated verdict. But with chants of \u201cMarine Pr\u00e9sidente!\u201d and \u201cThey won\u2019t steal 2027 from us,\u201d the message was clear: this was more than a protest. It was a show of populist defiance aimed squarely at France\u2019s institutions.",
      "Bardella sharpens the attack",
      "At the heart of that charge stood Jordan Bardella, Le Pen\u2019s 29-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and president of the National Rally. His speech was fiery, accusing France\u2019s judges of trying to silence the opposition.",
      "\u201cMarch 29 was a dark day for France,\u201d he said, referencing the date of Le Pen\u2019s conviction. \u201cThe people must be free to choose their leaders \u2014 without interference from political judges.\u201d",
      "Though he claimed the party would respect democracy, Bardella denounced magistrates\u2019 unions and warned of \u201ca system determined to crush dissent.\u201d Supporters carried signs reading \u201cJustice taking orders\u201d and \u201cStop the judicial dictatorship.\u201d Others wore \u201cJe suis Marine\u201d (\u201cI am Marine\u201d) shirts or compared Le Pen to U.S. President Donald Trump, who was convicted of civil fraud: \u201cTrump can run \u2014 why not Marine?\u201d",

She is appealing, with a ruling expected just months before the 2027 election.",
      "The verdict has split the country. Polls show Le Pen and Bardella still leading in first-round scenarios. But they also show that most French voters view the ruling as fair. While National Rally voters see her as a victim of a rigged system, much of the wider public sees it as justice served.",
      "Warnings of a \u2018Trumpist turn\u2019",

      "Though police were out in force, only minor clashes were reported.",
      "The real message: trust the people, not the courts",
      "Beyond the legal battle, Sunday\u2019s gathering of the National Rally revealed a deeper strategy. Party leaders have spent the week accusing judges of plotting a \u201cjudicial coup.\u201d They\u2019ve called the sentence a political \u201cexecution.\u201d The goal is not just to overturn the ruling \u2014 it\u2019s to convince voters the legal system itself can\u2019t be trusted.",
